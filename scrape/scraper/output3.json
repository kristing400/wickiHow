        "How to Paint Faux Leather": {
            "intro": "Artificial leather is a material that is commonly used for making upholstery, clothing, and accessories. It is typically made of plastic polymer, and it mimics the look and grain of real leather. Painting faux leather is a fun, inexpensive way to transform an outfit or spruce up an old accessory. After selecting a paint that will adhere to the material, and have fun painting an old faux leather chair or creating a design on a purse or skirt!",
            "steps": [
                "Use acrylic paints. Acrylic paint can be found in a range of colors, including metallic and glittery shades, and it can be found at an arts and crafts store. It can be applied to many surfaces and it adheres well to faux leather. Acrylic paint does not fade as easily as other paints. It is also flexible, making it is less likely to crack over time.[1]",
                "Choose a leather paint. Leather paint is an acrylic-based paint that can be found at your local arts and crafts store. It comes in a wide variety of colors and is specifically formulated to adhere to both real leather and artificial leather. Leather paint is slightly more expensive than acrylic paint and can cost between $2 and $8 for a small bottle.[2] Although it is more expensive, it is less likely to chip or fade over time.[3]",
                "Select chalk-based paint. Chalk-based paint can add a shabby chic, distressed look to an accessory or a piece of furniture.[4] It adheres to many different surfaces and fabrics, making it a great choice for painting faux leather.[5] Many brands have created variations of chalky paint which can be found at an arts and crafts store or a home improvement shop.",
                "Clean the faux leather. Use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to remove dust, dirt, grease, and wax from the faux leather. Dampen a cotton ball and wipe the entire surface of the material. A clean surface, free from dirt and grease, will allow the paint to strongly adhere to the faux leather.[6]",
                "Use a paint palette. Prepare a paint palette so you can easily and efficiently access your desired paint colors as you work. You can buy a wooden or plastic artist’s palette at an arts and crafts store, or you can use a sheet of aluminum foil, a newspaper, or a magazine to house your paint.[7]",
                "Mix a small amount of acetone to your acrylic paint. Squeeze your desired paint colors onto your paint palette and add a few drops of acetone to the paint if you are working with acrylics. The acetone will thin the paint, making it smooth and easier to work with. Gently mix the paint and the acetone together with a small paintbrush. Be sure to only add a few drops or up to a teaspoon of acetone to your paint so that the paint does not become too watery.[8]\n\nAcrylic paint can dry quickly, so do not squeeze too much paint onto your palette at once.\nGradually add a few additional drops of acetone if the paint is too thick.",
                "Apply a base coat for large surfaces. If you are painting a large surface in a uniform color, you will want to apply an even base coat of paint to the surface. Use the paint you selected for your project and apply it to the surface. This is ideal if you are working with furniture or clothing.[9]",
                "Apply paint to one side of a sponge. Lightly press the sponge into the paint from your paint palette. Use long, vertical strokes to distribute the paint across the faux leather surface. Acrylic paint can dry rapidly, so you will need to work quickly if you are working with this medium.[10]\n\nFocus on creating long strokes when painting a large surface to avoid creating streaks. If you are working on upholstery, plan to paint only one side at a time.",
                "Allow the paint to dry. Before adding additional coats, the paint will need to dry completely. Place the item in a safe place where it won’t be disturbed, damaged, or moved. Wait for about 15 to 20 minutes for the coat to dry completely.",
                "Enhance the color with additional layers of paint. After the first coat of paint has thoroughly dried, add another layer of paint to enhance the brightness and saturation of the color. As you add additional layers, be sure that the previous coat is dry before you apply another coating of paint.",
                "Trace a design onto the surface. Use a pencil to lightly trace your desired design onto the leather. Do not press too hard, as this will indent the leather. The paint is also semi-transparent, so any bold lines beneath the paint may show through.[11]",
                "Fill in the design. Using a paintbrush, fill in your design with the desired colors.[12] Try to avoid creating thick layers of paint. A thick layer of paint will be more likely to crack over time. If your design has multiple colors, let each color dry before moving on to the next to avoid smudging the paint.\n\n\nBe sure to clean your brushes each time you select a new paint color to work with. Keep a small cup of water next to your workstation. Dip the paintbrush in the water before placing it into another color.",
                "Clean up mistakes with acetone. If you make a mistake while painting, use a small amount of acetone on a cotton ball or cotton swab to gently lift away the paint. Once the paint is successfully removed and the area has dried, you can continue painting.",
                "Let it dry. When you have finished painting your design, put it aside and let it air dry. The item should be secured in a safe place where it won’t be damaged or disturbed. The paint should dry within 15 to 20 minutes."

        "How to Improve Mental Clarity": {
            "intro": "Your mind is a powerful tool. However, many of us have busy schedules and lack sleep, making it difficult for our minds to perform at their best. You can improve your mental clarity through physical measures like sleep and diet as well as mental exercises, puzzles, and meditation.",
            "steps": [
                "Attain a good quality and quantity of sleep. The National Sleep Foundation recommends seven to nine hours of sleep per night for optimal health and performance. Most people fall short of this due to a hectic schedule or an inability to fall asleep. During sleep, memories and information are being processed and organized in your brain, so it’s essential you get enough of it to achieve clarity.[1]",
                "Get regular exercise. Try light aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, swimming or casual cycling to increase the circulation of oxygen and glucose. Exercise helps your body work better, and that includes your brain. If you’re feeling mentally stuck, a walk outside will often help free your mind to work in a different direction.[2]",
                "Maintain a healthy diet. Keeping your body working well is essential to mental clarity. If you’re feeling physically good, your mind is free to work. Consume well-balanced, low-sugar and portion-controlled meals every four to five hours throughout the day.",
                "Eat foods that can help mental clarity. Scientists have begun researching food and its relationship to cognitive functions, and have some suggestions for your diet. Keep in mind that most of these are also just naturally healthy foods that are good to eat in general.[3]\n\nChocolate\nVegetables including cauliflower, chili peppers, sweet potatoes, beet juice\nCantaloupe\nSunflower seeds\nRice bran, fortified breakfast cereals\nYogurt",
                "Provide the right nutrients. When it comes to your brain, not all food is created equal. Your brain requires special nutrition for optimal performance.[4]\n\nInclude polyunsaturated and omega-3 fats in your diet. Avoid saturated, trans and hydrogenated fats as these may actually have a negative impact on mental clarity.\nTake vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, B vitamins (especially B12), magnesium and zinc. These play an integral role in energy production, cell protection and the overall health of your organs. They are involved with the nervous and immune systems.\nMake sure to get certain amino acids, such as taurine and tyrosine, which play an important role in neuro transmission. They can be quickly depleted in times of stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, exhaustion or with a sub-optimal diet.\nTry plant and herbal extracts, such as bacopa monnieri, rhodiola rosea, ginkgo biloba and huperzia serrata. These rejuvenate the nervous system and protect against neurodegeneration. They’ll help you to feel more alert by optimizing neurotransmission.",
                "Avoid alcohol. Even though at times alcohol may feel like it helps you focus, in the end alcohol makes your brain fuzzy. Alcohol in excess also interferes with the proper functioning of your body, making it difficult for your mind to achieve clarity.",
                "Reduce stress. For most of us, stress is the main reason we cannot focus as we want to. Think about stressors in your life and whether you can do anything about them.\n\n\nDo not seek out situations you know will be stressful.\nAvoid people who create stress in your life.\nTry to slow down. Think about carpooling or taking public transportation if you feel like you spend your life driving.\nDon’t overextend yourself. Know your limits and don’t volunteer for too much at work or in your personal life.",
                "Avoid distractions. Sometimes this is enough to keep your brain focused. Promise yourself that you’ll only check email or social media twice or three times a day. Stick to it. Set a time to give yourself a break, and keep it. You will probably be surprised at how much you can achieve without these distractions.[5]",
                "Exercise your mind to stimulate and strengthen your brain. Choose which activities appeal to you intellectually. Some of us like number-related games, while others prefer words.\n\n\nTry Sudoku, crossword puzzles, drawing and math quizzes. These create and maintain important neuronal connections critical to your cognitive ability.\nTry writing with your opposite hand. It may be difficult initially, but with a little practice and some neuronal connections, you’ll get the hang of it. Writing with your non-dominant hand forces you to focus both mentally and physically and can help clear your mind.",
                "Learn a new language. Even if you don’t get very good at it, the act of learning a new language can stimulate your brain in new and good ways. Particularly for older adults, learning a language can improve cognitive function.[6]",
                "Meditate. This might be the most useful technique to achieve mental clarity. Meditation allows you to clear your mind of all of the thoughts running through it and allow you to focus much more easily. Once you know how, you can do it for short periods at home or in another quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. To learn the techniques of meditation, there are many books and online resources available. There are also meditation classes and meetings in many communities.[7]",
                "Do yoga. Like meditation, part of the practice of yoga is clearing your mind. In yoga, it’s about focusing on the positions your body takes and clearing both your mind and body of stress. Yoga classes are widely available -- at community centers, yoga studios, and through gyms.[8]",
                "Explore your best time of day for mental clarity. We all have different body clocks, and each of us works better at a different time of day. Many people find that early morning is the time when their mind is most clear -- for others, it’s late at night, just before bed. Whatever time you naturally gravitate toward, schedule tasks for that time that require the most clarity.",
                "Find the conditions that help you clear your mind. For some people, working in total silence in a familiar place affords them the most clarity. Others like the background hum of a coffee shop. The location that helps you focus the most will be the place where you can do your best work -- find it!",
                "Consider a routine. If you know you need to do something that requires a great deal of thought, create a routine that helps to get you focused and free of outside thoughts. Continuing to do the routine anytime you need mental clarity will help train your mind to achieve that state more easily every time.\n\n\nMake yourself a cup of coffee or tea before you begin and think about the task ahead as you make your beverage.\nTake a shower before you begin.\nPut on comfortable clothing that helps you relax and focus.\nListen to a favorite song before you begin."

Clean it with soap and water and then attach it with duct tape around the ends of your filter and gas mask.\n\n\nBecause the charcoal could absorb the moisture from the air, becoming useless, only remove the cap from your filter when you need it.[2]",

        "wikiHow to Give a Neck Massage": {
            "intro": "People who sit at desks or drive for long periods of time often experience a lot of pain in their neck and shoulders. Giving them a neck massage is a great way to relieve that tension. Massages can also improve blood circulation, ease headache pain, improve someone's mood, and give an energy boost.[1] Giving a good neck massage is a wonderful gift, whether to a friend, loved one, or a professional massage client.",
            "steps": [
                "Place your partner in a comfortable seated position.[2] What's important is that his back can be comfortably straight. You must also be able to access his shoulders and upper back.\n\n\nUse a stool that gives you full access to his back.\nIf you use a chair, make sure the back of the chair is low enough to give you access to the back of his shoulders.\nIf you don't have an appropriate chair or stool available, place a comfortable cushion on the ground. Have your partner sit cross-legged on the ground while you kneel behind him.",
                "Use light, long strokes.[3] When we think of massages, most of us immediately think of the Swedish massage. It uses long, gentle motions along the surface of the muscles instead of the intense pressure of a style like the deep tissue massage.\n\nWhen you find tension knots, you can apply focused pressure.\nFor the most part, though, keep the pressure firm but not intense.",
                "Warm the muscles up. Rushing into intense massaging before warming up the muscles can cause your partner to tense up even more under your touch. Ease into the massage by using your fingertips to loosen up and prepare the neck and shoulders. This will put him in the frame of mind to relax into the experience.\n\n\nPlace the ring, middle, and index fingertips of your hands where the base of your partner's head meets the neck. Apply light but firm pressure.\nIf that feels uncomfortable, use whichever fingertips feel right to you. You might use just index and middle fingers.\nSlide your fingers down the sides of his neck, sweeping over onto the shoulders.\nMake sure to apply even pressure throughout, running your fingers over the muscles.",
                "Knead your thumbs into the tense muscles. In the previous step, you may have felt hard knots in the muscles. These knots indicate tension, and they need focused pressure from your thumbs.\n\nPlace your thumbs on the tension knot.\nPlace your other four fingers on each hand on the front of your partner's shoulder to stabilize your thumbs when you apply pressure.\nApply firm pressure with your thumbs in a kneading, circular motion to release the tension in the muscles.\nDo this throughout the shoulder muscles, but especially on tension knots.",
                "Glide your fingers up and down the neck. The muscles in the back and sides of the neck also carry a great deal of stress. You will use one hand to warm up the neck muscles for more focused attention.\n\nPlace your thumb on one side of the neck, and the tips of your other four fingers on the other side of the neck.\nApply and maintain firm but gentle pressure.\nGlide you hand up and down the length of the neck.\nMove along the width of the neck as well. Glide along the muscles along either sides of the spinal column on the back of the neck. Widen your hand to loosen the muscles on the sides of the neck as well.",
                "Pinch along the back of the neck.[4] You want to apply the same focused pressure along the sides of the neck with your thumb. But, you need your other four fingers to stabilize the pressure you're applying with your thumb. Working with both hands at once would force you to wrap your other fingers around the front of the throat. This would cause your partner pain and discomfort. Instead, work with one hand at a time.\n\nStand behind and slightly to his right.\nPlace the thumb of your left hand on the right side of his neck.\nWrap your other four fingers around to the left side of his neck to stabilize your thumb's pressure.\nJust as you did on the shoulders, knead your thumb in circular motions up and down the length of the neck.\nFocus attention on any tension knots you encounter.\nWhen you've finished the right side of your partner's neck, move to stand behind and slightly to the left of him. Repeat the process with your right thumb on the left side of the neck.",
                "Glide your hands down the sides of the neck. It can be difficult to massage the sides of the neck without bothering your partner's throat. To do this, you will glide your hand in a downward motion from the top of the neck to the front of the shoulder. Begin on the left side of his body.\n\nPlace your left hand on his left shoulder to stabilize him.\nWith the fingers on your right hand facing downward, place your thumb on the back of the neck and your remaining fingers on the side of it.\nApplying pressure, glide your hand in a downward motion.\nAt the end of the motion, your thumb should be on the back of the shoulder and your other fingers should be on the front of the shoulder.\nKnead your fingers into any tension points you feel.",
                "Apply pressure to the outsides of the shoulder blades. Press your fingertips into the shoulder blades and apply firm pressure. Move your hands in a circular, kneading motion to release tension from the muscles in the upper back.",
                "Use the heel of your palm between the shoulder blades. Because the spine is in the center of the back, it can be difficult to massage that area. Applying focused pressure to the spine will cause pain. Instead, use your palm to apply broad pressure.\n\nMove so you're standing at your partner's side.\nPlace one hand on the front of their shoulder to stabilize him.\nPlace the heel of your palm between his shoulder blades.\nApply firm pressure in a long, deliberate stroke from one shoulder blade to the other.",
                "Massage just under the collar bone. Although most of the massage focuses on the shoulders, neck, and upper back, a little attention to the upper chest can help relieve neck pain.\n\nStanding at your partner's side, place on hand on their back to stabilize him.\nUse your fingertips to rub firmly in circular motions just under his collar bone.\nMake sure not to press on the bone itself, as this will cause pain.",
                "Massage the upper arms. The arms may seem unrelated to the tension felt in the neck and shoulders, but they’re not. The muscles in the arms, shoulders, and neck all work closely in the movement of the arms. So, relieving tension in the upper arms will also benefit the neck.\n\nPlace your hands on his shoulders, applying gentle but firm pressure.\nMaintaining that pressure, run your hands down from the shoulders to his upper arms, then back up. Repeat this a few times.\nRub up and down the upper arms, loosening those muscles.",
                "Cycle through these motions in an un-patterned manner. If you focus too long on one area with one massaging motion, your partner will grow acclimated to the sensation. Move from muscle group to muscle group and vary your hands' motions to make the experience more pleasurable for him. The less he can predict the sensations, the better the massage will feel.\n\nThe muscles in the shoulders, neck, back, and arms are closely related. By paying attention to a wide area of muscles instead of the few muscles that may hurt, you are more likely to ease his muscle pain.",
                "Use all parts of your hand. Many amateur massagers use their thumbs exclusively when giving massages. While the thumbs are excellent for focused pressure, you can cause pain and discomfort to yourself by over-using them. Instead, use all parts of your hand while giving a massage. Use your thumbs for focused pressure to tension knots.\n\n\nUse your palms to apply light pressure over larger areas of skin and muscle.\nUse your fingertips for firmer pressure.\nUse your knuckles on particularly tight muscles.",
                "Do not massage your partner's bones. Applying pressure to bones — the spine especially — can cause pain. Apply pressure only to muscles.",
                "Continue for as long as necessary. A massage does not have to be long to be effective. A quick five-minute massage can make a world of difference. But, a long massage of half an hour to an hour will make him feel pampered and cared for.",
                "Place your partner in the supine position. \"Supine\" means that he's laying down on his back. Ideally, you can find an elevated surface for him to lay on which allows you to stand or sit in a chair at his head. If he lays on the ground, you’ll have to bend over quite a bit, and this could hurt your back. .\n\n\nTie long hair back so it doesn’t hang in your partner's face.\nIf he has long hair, sweep it back and over the side of the table or bed so you don’t accidentally pull it during the massage.\nAsk him to either remove their shirt or to wear a top that exposes his chest from the collarbone up.\nYou should provide a towel or blanket if he's uncomfortable with exposing his chest.",
                "Choose a massage oil or lotion. You can sometimes find massage oils at department stores, but if not, they can be purchased online.\n\n\nSome household oils, like coconut oil, also make wonderful massage oils.\nOlive oil, almond oil, and sesame oil can work well, but they tend to be heavy and thick. Use smaller amounts of these oils for a massage.\nMake sure your partner doesn't have any nut allergies before using almond or sesame oil.\nWork the oil or lotion through your hands by rubbing them together. This warms the product up to make it more comfortable for him.",
                "Warm up gently. Standing behind his head, place the heels of your palms against the sides of the neck. Use long, gentle Swedish strokes to apply pressure down the neck and over the shoulders.[5]\n\nPlace your thumbs under the neck and run the inside of your index finger down the length of it. Begin at the ear and work down to where the neck meets the shoulder.\nFan the motion out over his shoulders as well. You can use your middle, ring, and pinky fingers on the front of the shoulders.",
                "Apply more focused pressure to the neck.[6] Place four fingers ‘’under’’ both sides of the neck. Apply firm pressure, running your fingers from the base of skull to the shoulder.\n\nLoosen the muscles further by pulling your fingers up and away from the table or mat. In doing so, his head head should almost be lifted from the surface.\nRepeat this motion with your fingers all along the length of the neck.",
                "Work the neck and shoulders with your thumbs. Lifting your index through pinky fingers in the air, place your thumbs on the sides of the neck, just below the ears. Applying firm pressure, glide your thumbs down the sides of the neck. Slide them over the shoulders, all the way to the edges where they meet the arms.\n\nUse the length of your thumb, not just the tip. This applies diffused pressure rather than focused pressure.\nStay away from the exposed front of the throat. Applying pressure there will cause a good deal of pain.",
                "Massage the chest. The muscles in the front of the chest work in concert with those in the neck, so it’s important you give them some attention.\n\nPlace your thumbs lightly against the back of the shoulders.\nPlace your other four fingers along the front of the shoulders.\nApply kneading pressure both to the front of the shoulders and to the upper chest, under the collarbone.\nMake sure not to apply pressure directly to the collarbone, or any bone. This can be very painful.",
                "Apply rolling pressure under the neck. Place your index, middle, and ring fingers under both sides of your partner's neck. Beginning up by the ears, apply pressure in a rolling motion away from the head, toward the shoulders.\n\nBe firm, but not rough. Your motion might lift his shoulders a little bit off the surface, but he should not be flinching.",
                "Focus on each side of the neck. Turn his head to the side to expose the side of his neck to you. Support his head by keeping one hand placed under it. When you’ve finished working one side of the neck, gently turn his head the other way and work the other side.\n\nWith your free hand, use your fingertips to apply long, firm strokes from the earlobe down to the chest.\nUse your thumb to knead the side of the neck in small circles.",
                "Apply deep tissue pressure to the sides of the neck. Deep tissue techniques can cause pain, so you need to be alert to your partner's reactions while doing this. However, the muscles behind the ears can become very tense, so you must apply more intense pressure there to break up the knots. For this technique, the head should still be turned to the side, with one of your hands cradling it from below.\n\nMake a loose fist with your free hand and push the side of your fist into the side of the neck, just behind the ear.\nApply intense pressure and move your fist very slowly down the side of your neck. Work your way down to where the neck meets the chest.\nThe intense pressure can be very painful if you move your hand too quickly down the neck, so move at a glacial pace.\nBe careful to watch for signs of pain. Deep tissue massage, while relaxing in the long run, can be uncomfortable in the moment.\nGive him a break and have him take deep breaths if he feel pain. Begin again when he's ready.",
                "Work your fingertips in circular motions behind the ears. The muscles behind the ear, just below where your head meets your neck, tend to grow quite tense. Return your partner's head to an upright position for this technique, so you can work both sides of the neck at the same time.\n\nPlace your fingertips on those muscles and apply firm (but not painful) pressure.\nMove your fingertips in a circular motion to break up the tension in that area.",
                "Massage the muscles just above the collarbone. You'll feel a small dent right above the collarbone. Use your fingertips to gently massage the muscles in that area using both circular and kneading motions."

            "intro": "If you live in a dry climate, swamp coolers (a.k.a. evaporative coolers) are a great way to stay cool when the weather turns your home into an oven—and they are much less expensive than the typical hydro fluorocarbon-based air conditioner. Use these steps and tips to keep your home cool while using a swamp cooler.",
            "steps": [
                "Check the average humidity in your area. Evaporative coolers work best with very low relative humidity and hot temperatures. If the average humidity in your area is 40-50%, an evaporative cooler will not work properly.",
                "Check your water supply. Your swamp cooler will need a lot of water—as the name implies, it works by evaporation, so make sure you have plenty to go.",
                "Assess your house ventilation. Swamp coolers will increase the humidity in your home significantly, so you need to have very good ventilation. Homes built for evaporative coolers will have the ductwork in place, but for most retrofit installations, you'll want windows opened. I know, you grew up with your dad telling you \"close the windows, we aren't cooling the neighborhood,\" but with swamp coolers that's exactly what you want to do!",
                "Calculate your CFM rating. Swamp coolers are rated by how much air the cooler can move, and is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM).",
                "Use this formula to calculate the CFM needed to cool your home:\n\n\nDetermine the area of the space you want to cool.\nMultiply this figure by the height of your ceilings.\nDivide that number by 2 (120 for European measurements).\nThe result is the CFM rating for the evaporative cooler you need.\nFor example: If you have a 1,500 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) ceilings:\n\n1,500 square feet x 8 feet (2.4 m). ceilings = 12,000 ÷ 2 = 6,000 CFM.\nYou need a unit rated at 6,000 CFM or higher.\n\n\nExample 2, in CMS (cubic meters per second): If you have a 140m2 home with 3m ceilings:\n\n140m2 x 3m ceiling = 420 ÷ 120 = 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in).\nYou need a unit rated at 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in) or higher.",
                "Purchase an evaporative cooler. Make sure that it's rated at least the minimum CFM (CMS) that meets your requirements.",
                "Set it up. Different types are installed different ways. Your dwelling may be pre-fitted for installation, and if so—install there.\n\n\nSwamp coolers are most efficient on the roof: cool air sinks, after all. But there may be issues with placement, leakage, or supply that prevent that.\nConsider portable evaporative coolers. They are also available in-wall or window-mounted.\nMake sure you follow the manufacturers instructions completely to maximize the output of your swamp cooler.",
                "Create a \"vent\" to direct the cool air through the house. e.g. During the day open a window in the living room an inch or two and close the bedroom doors to cool the space you're using and cool less space. At night close the living room window and open one in each bedroom that will be used. Remember open the windows just a crack to direct air out without letting hot air in. Venting also prevents moisture build-up in your house will not only reduce the efficiency of the swamp cooler, it could also cause indoor humidity to run out of control and damage furniture, books, or musical instruments. This is because swamp coolers use moisture to cool the air. When there is too much moisture, the temperature won't change as much.",
                "Wait until it's 85°F (30°C) or higher outside. Believe it or not, swamp coolers operate the best when it's warmer. The evaporation mechanism is most efficient when there is a significant difference between the cooling pads, the water, and the air, and as long as the outdoor relative humidity is less than 30%.",
                "Clean the filter regularly. The water filter for the swamp cooler cleans out any impurities for maximum evaporation. When the filter is clogged, these impurities will get through and evaporation will slow, or stop altogether.\n\n\nIf that's not enough to motivate you, consider why the evaporative cooler bears the euphemistic name swamp cooler. Early units had a problem with algae growth, and the resultant odor would make an alligator feel right at home."

            "intro": "\nThis is another kind of \"sawbuck\" for extending a miter saw table to support long pieces of wood/lumber for cutting with the miter saw. You could be able to cut the straighter limbs and poles for firewood with this kind of sawbuck, using your \"miter saw\".",
            "steps": [
                "Select the size. Design the permanent sawbuck to be 6 vertical 2x4's (38 mm x 89 mm) or 2x6s (38 mm x 140mm) of about 4 feet (1.22 meters) long and 4 horizontal 2x6's 5 feet (1.52 meters) long using 3.5 inch (8.89 cm) wood screws or nails. (See \"Tips\" for information on making a demo/prototype version instead.)\n\nCutting the top \"V\" form portion at an angle and with a shorter top would make it lighter and more open. Adding a trough or floor, as a retainer like feature, into the top \"V\" allows for a lower chance of shorter pieces of firewood unexpectedly falling from the inner part of the sawbuck to the ground.",
                "Place the middle of the \"X\" a little higher for use with a chainsaw; rather than lower for a bow saw(if you prefer).",
                "Design your sawbuck/sawhorse by considering various methods shown in the illustrations. Tailor the design as you desire or require.",
                "Use suitable boards for your project. Nominal 2X6s or 2X4s of pine (southern yellow or lodgepole or white), or spruce will be fine.\n\nDecide if it is the taller or shorter height that you think you may want, namely, and cut the \"X\" pieces about 48 inches (1.22 meters) long.\nAdjust the height according to what feels right to you.",
                "Consider starting with one (the first) \"X\" temporarily attached together with two nails/screws to see how tall and wide that you want to make it.\n\nTake it apart and angle-cut and trim the angle of the \"V\" as shown in the photo above. Angled cutting of the \"V\" and making the upper \"arms\" shorter than the \"legs\" will make it less top-heavy. The arms help to hold poles and limbs to be cut on the sawbuck.",
                "Use this as your pattern for the rest.\n\nFeature: the upper \"V\" part being deep allows you to nestle and cut two or more narrow poles or tree limbs (around 3 to 8 feet (91.44 cm x 44 meters) in length) for cutting with a chainsaw to chop your firewood at a faster rate.",
                "Design a lower sawbuck if you would like to use the \"X\" sawbuck with a hand \"bow-saw\". Make the sawbuck about only 20-24\" (50.8 cm x 60.9 cm) high to the center. This will allow the user to put a foot on top of the poles or resulting in the split wood being cut when it is that low (as illustrated).",
                "Design a wide, heavily braced base to give you more stability while handling a chainsaw.\n\nCaution: A lightweight sawbuck might lead to an injury if it falls over while you are cutting. Don't use a smaller sawbuck for chainsaw work.",
                "To build a non-folding sawbuck, simply connect the \"X\" forms together, using 4 to 6 nails/screws driven permanently into the near-center of each \"X\".",
                "Make the sawbuck fold if you like. One way to connect the sawbuck together is to use one big bolt of about a 4 inch (10.16 cm) long, and 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) in diameter.\n\nYou may find inexpensive [or free] long bolts, and nuts that fit them, on the ground in a self-service, automobile wrecking yard). Put it in the exact same placement at the center of each \"X\", using extra-large washers, so that it can be clamped together and loosened to fold for storage.",
                "Consider screwing on a leg spacer-brace on each \"X\". Then unscrew the end spacer-brace to allow the \"X\" to fold.\n\nLong, common bolts are not very expensive- they cost between $1 to $1.50 each at a lumber or hardware store. (But, tempered, hardened, fine threaded bolts cost about 4 to 5 times as much.)",
                "A simple rough sawbuck or sawhorse may be built in the woods for a camp or lodge.",
                "The rustic form shown here can be made in the field from available materials, following a similar process but with wooden poles instead.\n\nState parks and such probably do not allow any harvesting of wood, so this - building a sawbuck- is for private land or the untamed wilderness."

        "How to Be a Gothic Lolita": {
            "intro": "Lolita is one of Japan's many popular street fashions that is growing in popularity in the Western world, meant to make the wearer look youthful and innocent. Gothic Lolita is a subset of the Lolita culture, and is (unsurprisingly) a cross between goth and Lolita styles. Now it's time for you to emulate the Gothic Lolita fashion, as well as to embrace the lifestyle. Although cosplaying can be incredibly time-consuming and expensive, it is also a fun hobby with a very inclusive, lively community.",
            "steps": [
                "Throw away your prejudices. Lolita style has nothing to do with pedophilia. The fashion and the lifestyle do not contain sexual connotations. Instead, most adherents present themselves as young Victorian, Edwardian, or Rococo children and strive to look modest and reserved. Gothic Lolita, or GothLoli, style in particular values a sober and elegant presentation.",
                "Explore Lolita types. There are many different styles of Lolita. There's Sweet Lolita, which uses bright pastels, lace, and overall sweet and \"kawaii\" themes; Gothic Lolita, which uses more blacks and whites and tends to be a darker, more elegant style of Lolita; and other less common subsets such as Classic Lolita, which favors a more refined and subtle fashion, or Punk Lolita, which might include accessories such as spikes and chains. Some Lolitas like to blend more than one style in their looks; however, this article will focus primarily on achieving straightforward Gothic Lolita dress and attitude.",
                "Know how to build a Lolita outfit. A Gothic Lolita look has many parts you can vary or alter as you like, but there are a few basic rules. One of them is that Gothic Lolitas favor dark colors, with the exception of white or cream accents - you probably won't find one wearing pink or other bright colors prominently. Here's what else you need to know, arranged in the order in which you'd get dressed.\n\n\nStart with undergarments. The most identifiable part of a Lolita look is the bell-shaped skirt that falls two inches above the kneecap or lower. Buying a petticoat, or pannier, built specifically to fill out Lolita skirts is essential. In order to maintain modesty in case the petticoat blows up in the breeze, Lolitas wear bloomers underneath the petticoat and over their regular underwear. Gothic Lolitas can also wear a corset, provided it's laced or buttoned properly. (Wearing a corset or bustier alone as a top falls into the Ero Lolita category.) Bloomers and petticoats should never be readily visible in the finished look.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/18/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nWear a refined, well-made blouse. Gothic Lolita blouses often feature fine tailoring, such as pintucks, embroidered details, and embellished cuffs or necklines. A slim, close fit is ideal; the blouse should never be baggy or saggy.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet2.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nPut on an embellished skirt, JSK, or one-piece dress. Gothic Lolita skirts commonly include ruffles, elegant patterns or bustles. They should sit at the natural waist and no lower, as well as almost covering your knees when standing. A JSK, or jumper skirt, is one you \"jump\" into, applied from the feet up. It usually includes some part that will cover part of the blouse. A black JSK over a white blouse is a typical Gothic Lolita look. For fancy events, Gothic Lolitas will sometimes wear one-piece dresses without a blouse. These garments are designed to fit closely through the torso and flare appropriately to accommodate the petticoat.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet3.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nWear modest stockings or tights. Some Lolitas wear socks or tights that hit below the kneecap, but Gothic Lolitas tend to prefer those that go over the knee. Wear garters under your bloomers to hold them up, if necessary. In general, Gothic Lolitas eschew sheer nylon or tights, favoring an opaque look instead.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet4.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nChoose dark shoes. Lolita style overall usually demands Mary Jane shoes, with perhaps a \"Lolita heel\" at the back. For Gothic Lolita, your shoes should be black or otherwise dark. If you choose to wear boots or another embellishment on Mary Janes, make sure they keep to a slim, natural leg silhouette - chunky combat boots would be out of place on a Gothic Lolita.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/64/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet5.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet5.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nUse hair accessories. An iconic Gothic Lolita accessory is a dark, large Alice bow, modeled after that of the heroine of Alice in Wonderland. You can also wear embellished headbands, combs or clips, as well as fascinators, period-appropriate hats or tiny top hats.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet6\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d0/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet6.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet6.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nFind a jacket. During colder months, Gothic Lolitas bundle up in well-tailored jackets. Choose black or another dark color, such as burgundy, navy, dark purple or hunter green.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/62/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet7.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet7.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nFinish up with other accessories. Some Gothic Lolitas carry parasols to shield themselves from the sun; others wear jewelry focused on elaborate crosses or carry purses in the shape of a coffin. Be creative with your accessories to make the Gothic Lolita look uniquely yours.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 3Bullet8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet8.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-3Bullet8.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Build your wardrobe. A well-made Gothic Lolita piece can last you a long time, but it will probably also be more expensive than your casual clothing. Invest in your wardrobe carefully, purchasing items you adore and that are constructed from quality materials. Start with bloomers and a petticoat, and build from there.\n\n\nPay attention to fabrics. Gothic Lolita culture favors cotton, wool, organdy, lace and other generally high-quality textiles. Satin and crushed velvet are regarded as costume-like, and frowned on for everyday use. Additionally, cheap lace that features heavy netting is also disdained, as it can look gray and ratty from a distance.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Gothic Lolita Step 4Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e7/Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-4Bullet1.jpg/aid30598-v4-728px-Be-a-Gothic-Lolita-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Wear naturally appealing makeup. One point at which Gothic Lolita culture diverges from American Gothic culture is makeup - Gothic Lolitas don't use whiteface or particularly dark eye and lip colors. A slightly smoky eye or red lip is acceptable, but generally Gothic Lolitas strive to wear natural-looking makeup.",
                "Dress to impress. Wearing a Gothic Lolita look should be an event. Make sure everything is cleaned and ironed appropriately, and put effort into your hair and makeup - looking half-done while wearing such beautiful clothing would be tragic. Plan ahead.",
                "Incorporate Lolita into your everyday clothing and environment. If you can't wear full Lolita outfits everyday incorporate details that you like and go with your usual clothing: maybe that lace choker will go well with your business suit, or that cute purse is nice for a trip to the mall. Things like that that make you unique and identify you as a Lolita, even if you can't wear your outfits everyday.",
                "Practice good posture. Gothic Lolita clothing is shown off to the best advantage when your posture is erect, with straight shoulders and a high head. Try walking in light, measured steps instead of shuffling or dragging your feet.",
                "Mind your manners. Because Lolita style harkens back to the 19th century, try emulating the socially acceptable manners of the time period. Speak politely and crisply, without relying on contractions or slang. Do not use swear words as well. Be courteous to everyone, and acknowledge strangers or new acquaintances with a slight tip of your head or a small smile. Be confident without being rude, and courteous without being a doormat.",
                "Indulge in antiquated hobbies. Bring some old-fashioned beauty into your life by learning Victorian arts or skills, such as sewing and/or embroidering (it will help you with your clothing if you are on a budget or don't want to buy off Japan), cooking, calligraphy, painting or sketching, and collecting things like antiques or stamps.",
                "Look for sources of beauty or inspiration in everyday life. A Lolita lifestyle is, to a certain extent, about maintaining a childlike sense of innocence and wonder. Try seeing your life through fresh, less-jaded eyes and watch your attitude improve!"

        "wikiHow to Overcome a Driving Phobia": {
            "intro": "Some people say they don't like driving or are afraid of getting behind the wheel. If you find that you're extremely afraid of driving to the point that it's causing you distress, you may have a phobia of driving. This specific phobia might make you feel as though your life is in danger when you're driving or riding in a car. You might even experience panic attacks, racing heart, rapid breathing, or feelings of terror.[1] If your anxiety behind the wheel is controlling you and preventing you from driving with ease, or even at all, it's important to face the phobia. This way, you can get back behind the wheel and take control of your life.",
            "steps": [
                "Create a calm environment in the car. You should feel comfortable just sitting in the car regardless of whether or not it's moving. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Practice sitting in the car and becoming relaxed before you begin driving. Consider playing soothing music. It may help you overcome a sense of rising panic and can drown out the noise of other cars.\n\n\nEven the most confident driver can become anxious if there are noisy passengers in the car. Make sure the car is quiet and free of trash or clutter.\nIncrease your sense of safety in the car by making sure your car gets any needed repairs.",
                "Practice abdominal breathing. If you begin to feel a panic attack come on or your neck and chest muscles tighten, begin breathing deep into your lungs. Inhale slowly through your nose with the focus of getting air to the bottom of your lungs. Let your belly expand and pause for a moment while you hold your breath. Slowly exhale and let your whole body relax.[2]\n\nYou can repeat this process 10 times counting backwards from ten on each exhale. Try to complete three sets of 10.",
                "Try progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Tighten and relax muscle groups in your body so that you become aware of how to hold and release tension. Begin by clenching your fists for 7-10 seconds. Release your fist for 15 to 20 seconds while you focus on how the tension is leaving the muscles in your hands. Repeat the exercise with other muscle groups, moving up your arms, to your head, then down the back of your body to your feet and toes.[3]\n\nYou can even practice PMR every day for 20 minutes even if you are not experiencing panic. This can improve your sense of control over your mood, reduce the frequency of panic attacks, and increase your concentration.",
                "Use positive affirmations. Affirmations are short positive statements that remind you that you can make changes. With driving, the type of affirmations that you might want to use include:\n\n\nI am driving carefully and within the speed limit. Careful driving is safe driving.\nDriving is a common, everyday activity. I am an alert driver participating in a common activity with care.\nI do not have to drive fast. I can drive in the right-hand lane if I want to travel slower than other cars.\nI do not have to risk switching lanes at the last minute. If I miss a turn-off, I can safely double back.\nI have planned this journey from start to finish. I know where I am headed and when I have to make lane changes and turn offs. I am well prepared.\nEven though I am a passenger, I can control my reactions to riding in the car. If I feel uncomfortable at any time, I can ask the driver to pull over.",
                "Consider confronting your phobia. You've probably been told that you need to face your fear. Exposing yourself to the fear is especially important if you've been avoiding driving for fear that you'll have a panic attack. Exposure therapy remains one of the most important ways to get over a phobia, although you should know and be able to use relaxation techniques before you start. This way, you'll have some sense of control during the session.\n\n\nAvoiding your phobia will actually make the fear worse over time and can create other phobias.[4]",
                "Create an anxiety scale. Become familiar with your anxiety levels so you can take action before you reach a full scale panic attack. Having a scale of anxiety will also help you know when to stop exposure before you reach moderate panic. Your scale should describe physical and mental characteristics of anxiety. An example scale might look like this:[5]\n\n0 - Fully Relaxed: no tension, calm, feeling peaceful\n1 - Minimal Anxiety: feeling slightly nervousness, more alert or aware\n2 - Mild Anxiety: muscle tension, tingling or butterflies in stomach\n3- Moderate Anxiety: heart and breathing increase, feeling slightly uncomfortable but still in control\n4 - Marked Anxiety: clear muscle tension, increased feelings of being uncomfortable, starting to wonder about staying in control\n5- Beginning Panic: heart is starting to race or beat irregularly, dizziness, clear fear of losing control, wanting to escape\n6 - Moderate Panic: heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feeling disoriented\n7 to10 - Full Panic Attack: feelings of terror, fear of dying, and increased feelings of moderate panic",
                "Write down your fears. Be specific and write down what things you fear about driving. Then, go through and rank these fears from what you fear the least to what causes a full panic attack. This will help you gradually expose yourself to your fears. But, you'll slowly work your way through your fears so that you never feel truly out of control.\n\n\nFor example, holding the keys in your driveway might be something you fear the least while driving on the highway can cause you to have a panic attack.",
                "Take gradual steps. Start with the least feared item on your list and gradually expose yourself until you no longer feel anxious. Once you've mastered an item on your list, move on to the next thing on your list or scale. For example, you list might expose yourself to fears like these (ranked from least to greatest feared):[6]\n\nHold your car keys and look at your car in the driveway\nSit inside of your car, working up to 5 minutes\nDrive around the block\nDrive in your neighborhood making right turns, then left turns\nDrive on a main street taking left turns at traffic lights or stop signs\nDrive on a highway in the right lane for 1 to 2 exits\nDrive on a highway in the left lane for 2 exits\nDrive on the highway changing lanes past cars for 3 to 5 exits",
                "Ride with drivers you trust. If you find that you can't even stand being a passenger in a car, follow the exposure therapy steps. Instead of driving, you may want to gradually face your fear by riding in a car with a driver you trust. Choose someone you know will drive with the greatest of care. Once you're comfortable riding with that person, try to ride with other drivers or ride along on more challenging drives (like on the highway).\n\n\nFind what feels the most comfortable for you when you begin riding as a passenger. You might find that you prefer to sit in the backseat. Or, maybe you find it less stressful to sit next to the driver. Experiment to find what works for you.",
                "Commit to learning how to drive. Most people are afraid of getting behind the wheel for the first time. To ease your fear, choose a knowledgeable driving instructor who has a lot of experience teaching new drivers. A good driver can reassure you and make you feel comfortable in the driver's seat.[7]\n\nConsider working with a driving school instructor. You might realize that the anxiety you had been feeling about learning to drive actually stemmed from your previous instructor, especially if it was a relative trying to teach you how to drive.",
                "Know when to see your doctor. If your fear of driving is disrupting your life, you should get medical or psychological treatment. If you're unsure who to ask for help, contact your doctor who should be able to put you in touch with trained professionals.[8] You may work with your doctor, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a counselor trained in phobias.\n\n\nIf you're increasingly depressed by your inability to drive, make sure to seek help. Don't simply adjust to the fear that prevents you from driving this can cause other phobias to develop.[9]",
                "Try therapy. You may work with a counselor or therapist on a one-on-one basis. In addition to relaxation techniques and exposure therapy, your counselor may simply want you to talk. Talking is an important way for your brain to learn how to handle fear. It will give you a chance to think about what's behind the fear and can treat your driving phobia.[10][11]\n\nDon't expect your counselor to offer you advice. Many counselors simply listen and ask questions so you can give thoughtful answers and explore your fear.",
                "Join a support group. If you'd rather talk about your phobia with a group, find a local driving phobia support group to talk with. You may also find an online support group with people who experience similar symptoms. Just knowing that you're not alone can be helpful in overcoming your fear.[12]\n\nYou can also talk with friends and family. Share your fears with them and explain the challenges you face. It can help knowing that you have friends and family who understand what you're going through."

        "How to Be a Lady": {
            "intro": "As manners, attitudes, and styles of dress change over time, so has the conventional understanding of what it means to be a “lady.” Though the term may seem outdated, there are certain aspects of ladylike behavior that are undying: elegance, courteousness, and a sense of respect toward oneself and others. Read this article to learn how to be a true modern-day lady.",
            "steps": [
                "Make introductions. If you are talking to one person and another person approaches, introduce the person you were initially talking to the person who has just arrived.\n\n\nIn the business world, the order in which introductions are made depends on a person’s level of “importance;\" in other words, on his or her level of seniority within the company. In such an example, you would first introduce the person of higher importance to the person of lesser importance, and then vice versa. [1] Remember that the client is always of the highest seniority, regardless of his or her title.\nAdd a thoughtful detail about the person you are introducing, when possible. Rather than just stating the person’s name, also introduce his or her title, or how you know this person.",
                "Say please and thank you. While this may sound like an etiquette cliché, forgetting to say these things (even by accident) will not go unnoticed, and comes across as very rude.\n\n\nSay thank you anytime somebody does you a favor, however big or small; it will show him or her that you appreciated it.\nAlways thank a host/hostess after attending a party or other special occasion at his or her home. Consider sending a “thank you” text, phone call, or email the following day.\nAlways thank people for gifts they have given you. You may want to consider writing the person a note thanking them.\nDon’t abuse the words “please” and “thank you.” Using them excessively will devoid them of their meaning, and make you appear weak. For example, if a waiter pulls your chair out for you, unfolds your napkin, and then pours you a glass of water, then thank him/her one time at the very end of the action, rather than once after each gesture.\nAdd details when thanking others. Rather than just saying “Thanks” to a friend for talking you through an issue, say “Thank you for being so understanding. It really means a lot to me.” This will come across as more sincere.",
                "Know when to say no. Being polite doesn’t mean being passive and letting others take advantage of you. It is important to learn how to politely tell people no.\n\n\nIf somebody offers you alcohol or a cigarette and you are not interested, then kindly thank the person and refuse. Giving in against your will sends the impression that you are easily impressionable.\nSimilarly, if a man is attempting to “pick you up” or is getting physically aggressive with you, then stand up for yourself and tell him to back off. If necessary, call or ask for help.",
                "Educate yourself. A lady is eloquent and can carry a conversation. This requires being well-read and staying up-to-date on the current events of the world. While this doesn’t necessarily require formal education, attaining the highest possible level of education that you can will be to your benefit.\n\n\nIf you are not enrolled in school, then find alternative ways to educate yourself. Read plenty of books (both fiction and non-fiction), read the news, and attend seminars and/or discussions.\nThanks to the internet, most people have free access to an endless array of scholarly articles on various topics at the touch of a button.\nMany college campuses allow people to sit in on lectures without receiving academic credits. Be sure to clear this with the institute before dropping in on classes, however.",
                "Have good posture. Standing and sitting up straight are signs of a true lady. As an added bonus, having good posture is better for your back, and will help strengthen up your core! It will take some training to get used to this, especially if you are accustomed to slouching.",
                "Be respectful toward others. Being a lady isn't just about looking or behaving properly on the outside; it involves being a good person on the inside.\n\n\nWhen talking to another person, give him or her your undivided attention. It is polite, and will make for a more stimulating conversation for both parties.\nDon't interrupt or talk over others.\nOffer your help to those in need. This can be as simple an act as helping an elderly person carry his or her groceries, or a more generous act like volunteering at a homeless or animal shelter.",
                "Be charming. A true lady doesn't just sit there quietly and let the world pass her by. She engages with other people, carries stimulating conversations, and is a subtle flirt.\n\n\nIf you don't know how to be charming, start off by smiling more at people when you talk to them, and complimenting people more. Make your compliments personal; for example, instead of complimenting a person's shoes, tell them that you think they have impeccable sense of fashion.",
                "Don't use profanity, overeat or drink excessively. Being a lady requires having self-control and will power, and each of these activities is an example of overindulgence.",
                "Be respectful when visiting others' homes. When you are a guest in somebody else's home, allow the host/hostess to tell you where to sit, where to leave your purse, whether or not to take off your shoes, and so on.\n\n\nRemember that some people are more protective over their home environment than others. Use your best judgment to determine how to behave.",
                "Hold the door open for others. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, offering to hold the door open for other people is respectful and friendly.",
                "Stay calm, cool, and collected. Avoiding lashing out at others if you are annoyed, angry, or upset. Remain poised, and handle the situation rationally and calmly. This will prevent you from doing or saying things in the heat of the moment that you will regret later.",
                "Maintain your personal hygiene. This will keep you looking and smelling your best, and more importantly, prevent infections and other illnesses.\n\n\nShower daily. If you don't want to wash your hair everyday, then wear a shower cap and rinse your body with soap and water.\nBrush your teeth every morning and evening. Brushing in between meals can further improve the health and appearance of your teeth and gums.\nWear deodorant. Smelling your best is just as important as looking your best.\nMaintain your waxing, shaving, and/or tweezing regimen. Getting rid of unwanted body hair can instantly make you look and feel more attractive and leave you with smooth, touchable skin.",
                "Dress elegantly. This means dressing appropriately for the occasion, your body type, and your age. Use your best judgment to determine what clothes are most appropriate for you.\n\n\nBuy fewer but better quality clothes which will last; wearing cheap, throwaway items isn't good for your new image\nDon't try to squeeze into clothes that don't fit you.\nStart to wear skirts or dresses rather than pants. They bring out your femininity and show off your curves better than pants do and you will feel much more elegant and feminine. And nothing says 'lady' more loudly that a girl wearing a smart skirt when all her friends are wearing jeans.\nDon't go bare-legged. Always wear tights or pantyhose.\nDon't feel obliged to wear high heels if you find them uncomfortable - flat shoes are just as good.\nDon't wear sweatpants or tracksuits unless you are at the gym or exercising. Wearing these around all day suggest that you pay very little attention to your physical appearance.",
                "Keep your clothing clean and pressed. Iron your clothes to remove any wrinkles, and be sure to wash your clothes if they are stained.",
                "Don't wear excessive makeup or revealing clothing. Elegance requires minimalism; wear makeup to accentuate your beauty, not to cover it up.\n\n\nDon't show excessive cleavage or wear bare-midriff tops. These types of revealing clothes suggest that you are not dressing for yourself, but rather, to attract men.",
                "Don’t start eating before the meal has started. If you are at a restaurant, wait until everybody’s meal has arrived before you start to eat. When at a dinner party, wait for the host/hostess to unfold his or her napkin and begin eating.",
                "Don’t speak with food in your mouth. It is not only rude, it can actually ruin other peoples’ appetites.\n\n\nAlso avoid burping, smacking your lips, or fidgeting at the dinner table.\nIf you have to cough or sneeze at the table, be sure to cover your mouth with a napkin.",
                "Excuse yourself when necessary. If you need to get up from the table to go to the restroom, let others know where you are going.",
                "Don’t text or talk on the phone. Not only will it disturb other patrons if you are in a restaurant, it is disrespectful to the person/people you are eating with, especially if one of them has cooked the meal for you. Wait until the end of the meal to make phone calls.\n\n\nTurn off or silence your phone during formal dinners.",
                "Leave your elbows off of the table. This rule applies only when you are actually eating. If the food has not yet arrived, or if you are sitting at a table drinking water or other beverages, then it is acceptable to rest your elbows on the table.",
                "Cut your food into bite-sized portions. Not only is it healthier than taking huge bites, it will give you the opportunity to quickly chew and swallow your food if somebody asks you a question when you have food in your mouth. Nothing is more frustrating (and embarrassing) than having somebody ask you a question right after you have taken a huge bite of food!",
                "Only grab for things on the table that are within your reach. Otherwise, ask somebody to please hand it to you.\n\n\nAlways pass the salt and pepper shaker together, even if the person only asks for one of them. These items are meant to be kept together at all times.",

        "wikiHow to Choose Your Glasses Frames": {
            "intro": "Choosing a pair of frames is an important part of matching your eyewear to your personality and lifestyle. In the twenty first century, there are a variety of sources you can choose from. Your optometrist will be able to offer the most tailored fit, but they may not have frames you love. Other sellers may also be able to significantly undercut the price of your optometrist. Before you go shopping, however, you need to determine the shape, size, color, and material of your frames.",
            "steps": [
                "Think about how often you wear glasses. This has an effect on several aspects of your new frames. People who wear glasses less often probably want to spend less money. They may also be okay with heavier frames. Those who wear glasses regularly may want to spend more money on a more durable pair. They might also want lighter, more practical frames.",
                "Think about your daily lifestyle. Some of your daily activities may call for special features. Proximity to water, activity, and machinery will affect which frames you select. If you wear your glasses during manual labor, look at the glasses of those around you. The common denominator between your coworkers’ frames may give you an idea as to what works best in your job.[1]\n\nThose who are active throughout the day should look into break and scratch resistant frames. This will minimize how often you have to get the frames repaired. It is also advisable that you pick frames with a warranty. Free or discounted repairs are a must for the active glasses wearer.",
                "Determine how nice you want them to look. Think about how you will use your glasses. Some emphasize practicality and price over style. Others will use their glasses in professional or social situations that call for more sleek or stylish frames. The minimalistic pairs will cost you less, but the more fashionable are more likely to accentuate your face and outfit.",
                "Determine your face shape. Picking the most ideal frame for your face is not entirely up to you. Much is dictated by the natural features of your face. The most important aspect of this is your face shape. You can easily figure this out by looking in the mirror or taking a picture, and comparing it to a diagram.[2]\n\nRound face. With this shape, look into more toward square and rectangular frames that will make your face look slimmer and longer. Avoid frameless, oval, and circular frames.\nOval. Pick frames with a strong bridge, and avoid large frames that will make your face look small.\nSquare. To offset the angularity of your face, tend toward rounded or round frames.\nDiamond. You may not want to accentuate your narrow forehead, so don’t pick wide frames that call attention to this. Opt instead for small, rounded frames.\nHeart. To minimize how large your forehead appears compared to your chin, pick frames that sit low on the nose. This makes the center of your face seem lower.",
                "Figure out skin allergies. If this is not your first pair of frames, you probably have an idea of your skin allergies. Otherwise, your dermatologist can give you a test to determine this. If you are unsure and don’t want a test, there are materials that are more likely to break out your skin than others.[3]\n\nPlastic or synthetic. These frames are often designed to be hypoallergenic, meaning they are less likely to break out your skin. They also have a wide price range. A few examples are cellulose acetate/zylonite, cellulose propionate, and nylon.\nMetal. Metal frames vary, as far as skin allergies are concerned – some are hypo-allergenic, but others may break you out. Examples are titanium, stainless steel, beryllium, and aluminum.\nOther/natural materials. Wood, bone, and horn do not usually cause skin allergies.",
                "Look at your skin tone. Most people fit into two basic categories for skin tone. To figure out if you have warm or cool skin tone, hold up a piece of white paper next to your face. If your skin seems yellowish, brownish, or bronze, you have a warm skin tone. If your skin seems pinkish or bluish, you have cool skin tone.[4]\n\nFor warmer skin tones, stick with tortoise, browns, and dark green over white, black or pastel colors that contrast heavily.\nFor cooler skin tones, look for more stark colors like black, white, and bright colors. The more brownish hues will contrast with your skin tone.",
                "Consider your hair color. This is similar to your skin – there are two main categories of hair tones. Some cool hair colors are strawberry-blonde, blue-black, and white. Examples of warmer hair colors are brownish-black, golden blonde, and gray. Apply the same rules for frame color as with your skin tone.",
                "Figure out your optometrist’s rates for fitting your lenses. Some optometrists feature frames in their office. They may fit your lenses in these for free or at a discounted rate. Before shopping around, you should know if their rate for bringing in an outside pair of frames will put the glasses out of your price range.",
                "Look at optometrist’s prices for frames. It seems that the best prices will be at specialty or discount frames shops. However, you may find that the difference between these shops and your optometrist is negligible. After the fee for fitting your lens, warranties, and other considerations, you may be better off picking frames from your optometrist.\n\n\nIf you only use your glasses minimally and at home, you may not feel the need to have a big insurance plan. Determine if you need to be able to get your frames repaired for free when comparing costs.",
                "Look at other glasses shops in the area for frames. There may be specialty frame shops that sell products much different than those offered by your optometrist. They may also be discounted enough that it vastly outweighs the benefits of picking a pair in your optometrist’s office. Don’t limit yourself to the prices and stock of one shop when picking out new frames.",
                "Look at materials, size, weight, and features. Without an optometrist or impartial observer around, you need to pay close attention to the frames’ specifications. In addition to looking at its special features, material, and size, look at the weight. Without the ability to try on glasses you find online, you will have to compare their specifications with glasses lying around the house. Weigh your old glasses using a mini scale and use it to gauge the relative weight of frames you find online.",
                "Know your measurements. It is important to get frames that will fit the anatomical features of your face. Even a pair of glasses that is the right total width and height may still not fit your face. Make sure all the measurements are right for your face by taking a pair of glasses you have on-hand and using its measurements to determine the relative size of a pair online. These measurements are generally in millimeters.[5]\n\nEye. This is the width of each lens, from its outermost points.\nBridge. This is how far apart each lens is.\nTemple. This is the length of the piece that tucks behind your ear.\nB measurement. This is the height of each lens, measured from its highest and lowest points.",
                "Measure your pupillary distance (PD). This is the distance between your pupils. Since it is difficult to measure on your own, the way to get the most accurate PD is to have your optometrist measure it for you. However, there are ways you can ‘do it yourself’ at home. This might save yourself time and get a general idea of what range of PD sizes you fall into. This number is generally measured in millimeters.\n\n\nThe easiest way to measure PD at home is with a picture. Hold an item you know the dimensions of (like a pen) directly under your chin. Take a picture in the mirror and get out a ruler. For example, if the pen was 5” (or 127 mm) long, and appears 1” (25.4 mm) long in the photo, you know the ratio of photo measurements to actual measurements is 1:5. So, if your pupil distance was a half inch in the photo, we multiply that by 5. This number gives us the pupillary distance – 2.5”, or 60mm.",
                "Look at the store’s policies. You want to be able to try the glasses on and return or exchange them for free. Also take into consideration how this will affect your bottom line price, especially with shipping charges. You should look for a seller that offers some kind of warranty, insurance, and maintenance guarantee.[6]",
                "Try them on and consider returning them. This is the most important aspect of buying glasses online. It is impossible to be as accurate with your own measurements choosing a pair online as a pair tailored for you by your optometrist. The online seller may also have misleading or inaccurate pictures or specifications. Wear them for a day or so, and think about your levels of comfort and vision."

            "intro": "Fiberglass is widely used in various forms as an insulator or lightweight building material, both in industries and at home. Handling it can leave fiberglass splinters lodged in the skin, causing irritation and intense itching (contact dermatitis). If you have regular or occasional contact with fiberglass, you will run into this problem. By taking the right steps, however, you can ease the itching and irritation.",
            "steps": [
                "Do not rub or scratch the affected area. Fiberglass can cause intense itching on the skin, and it is tempting to scratch it. However, this can force the irritating fibers deeper into or over the skin, making the problem even worse.[1][2]",
                "Immediately carefully remove any clothing you wore while in contact with fiberglass. [3] Keep it apart from your other clothing as personal items, and wash it separately. This will help keep the fibers from spreading and causing more irritation.",
                "Wash your skin if you are exposed to fiberglass. If you see, feel, or suspect that your skin has come into contact with fiberglass, you should wash the area as soon as possible. If you are already suffering from itching and irritation, wash the affected area with mild soap and warm running water.[4][5][6]\n\nYou can use a washcloth very lightly to help remove fibers.\nIf fiberglass got in your eyes, flush them with water for at least 15 minutes.[7]",
                "Remove any fibers that are visible. If you see individual fibers sticking out of or just under the skin, you can try to carefully remove them yourself.[8] This will help to stop the irritation.\n\n\nFirst, wash your hands and clean the area with soap and water (if you have not already).\nSterilize tweezers by wiping them with rubbing alcohol, then use them to remove the fibers.[9]\n\nA magnifying glass can help you see small fibers.\nIf you see the fibers but cannot remove them easily with tweezers, sterilize a clean sharp needle by wiping it with rubbing alcohol.[10] Use it to lift or break the skin over the fiber. Then use sterile tweezers to remove it.\nSqueeze the site gently gently to allow bleeding to wash germs out. Wash the area again and apply an antibiotic cream.\nIf you see fibers deep below the skin, contact a doctor and do not try to remove them yourself.",
                "Use a cream to soothe your skin. After washing the area of skin affected by fiberglass, apply a quality skin cream.[11] This can help to soothe and moisturize your skin, giving some relief from the irritation. You can also apply an over-the counter anti-itch cream for additional relief.",
                "Wash clothing and any other materials that may have come in contact with fiberglass. Remove any clothes worn while in contact with fiberglass, and keep them separate from other clothes. Wash them as soon as possible, separately from any other clothes. This will help to prevent any lingering fibers from spreading and causing irritation.[12]\n\nIf there is a lot of fiber material on the clothing, presoak it before washing. This will help to loosen the fibers and rinse them away.\nAfter washing your clothing that came into contact with fiberglass, rinse your washer with water before washing any other clothing. This will wash away any fibers that might have stuck in the machine, and keep them from spreading to other clothes.",
                "Clean your work area. If you were working with fiberglass when you came into contact with it, be sure to clear any remaining bits of fiberglass from your work area as soon as possible. This will help prevent another reaction to the material.\n\n\nUse a vacuum to remove bits of fiberglass, rather than a dry broom (which may sweep particles into the air).\nWearing protective clothing, goggles, and a mask or respirator while cleaning will also keep particles from affecting your skin, eyes, or lungs.[13]",
                "Pay attention to the affected area. While contact with fiberglass can be painful and irritating, the symptoms should subside soon if you follow the steps for treatment. If the itching and irritation persists, however, seek medical attention.[14]",
                "Wear appropriate clothing when handling fiberglass. Whenever you work with or know you will be exposed to fiberglass, wear protective clothing. Long sleeves, pants, closed-toed shoes, and gloves will all help to protect your skin from fibers.[15][16] Try to keep as much of your skin covered as possible.\n\n\nWearing any sort of respirator or face mask will also protect you from breathing in airborne particles of fiberglass.[17]",
                "Keep your work area clean and ventilated. If you are working with fiberglass, your work area should have a good airflow so that bits of the material do not linger in the air and settle on your skin or clothing and so that you do not breathe them in. [18]\n\nKeep your work clothes separated from other clothes.\nDon’t eat, drink, or smoke while handling fiberglass. This will keep you from accidentally eating or inhaling fiberglass particles.\nIf you notice any symptoms of irritation caused by fiberglass, stop and treat them before returning to work.",
                "Shower after handling fiberglass. Shower as soon as possible after handling or being exposed to fiberglass—even if you don’t notice any irritation or itching. This will help to rinse away any fibers that might be on your skin but that aren’t yet causing a reaction.[19]\n\nShowering with cold water, if you don’t yet notice any reaction, will rinse any fiberglass particles off of your skin while also keeping your pores closed and any particles out of them. [20]",
                "Talk to your doctor about any concerns you may have about fiberglass exposure. If you are unsure about your symptoms, or your contact with fiberglass, talk to your doctor.\n\n\nSome people may develop a kind of tolerance to fiberglass in time, so that it doesn’t irritate them in the way it once did. However, this does not mean that there are no potential skin or lung problems, so always be careful handling fiberglass.[21]"

        "How to Juggle a Soccer Ball": {
            "intro": "Learning how to juggle a soccer ball is great way to impress your soccer buddies, gain better balance, and control the ball during a game. While juggling may seem difficult at first, the key to absolute success is to practice, practice, practice. Follow these steps to learn how to juggle with your feet, thighs, head, and shoulders--you'll be juggling like a pro in no time!",
            "steps": [
                "Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces.\n\nMake sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot.\nIf you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick.[1] Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball.\nKeep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick.",
                "Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground.[2]\n\nIt is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest keys to balancing is to keep you knees bent and your eyes on the ball.",
                "Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it!",
                "Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet.\n\nYou can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",
                "Drop the ball and let it bounce. Kick it up with your right foot. Try to keep the kick controlled and aim to kick the ball straight up in the air. Try to kick it no higher than your waist.",
                "Let the ball drop and then kick it up with your left foot. Again, try to keep your kick light and controlled so that the ball only goes up to your waist. Smaller kicks are easier to control and better for learning how to alternate feet. Be prepared for the fact that you will probably move around a lot while you learn how to alternate feet.[3]",
                "Catch the ball once you have kicked it once with both feet. Readjust if you have moved around and then drop the ball again. When you have kicked the ball with both feet twice, catch the ball. Then try kicking it three times with both feet, then four times etc. You'll have mastered this step when you can stand in one place and keep juggling the ball between your feet indefinitely.",
                "Place the ball at your feet. Take your dominant kicking foot, and place it on top of the ball. Roll your foot down the ball just strong enough to create a backspin on the ball. Place your toe underneath the ball, and allow the ball to roll up your foot. Immediately kick the ball straight up, as if you were going to catch it with your hands.",
                "Position yourself so you can kick the ball up with your other foot. Do this as the ball comes back down. Alternate feet and continue to juggle as you learned how to do in the previous section. Every time the ball drops, do not pick it up--use your foot to roll the ball up on your laces and start juggling again.",
                "Keep the foot you are kicking with near the ground. Moving your leg up too high while you kick the ball will make you lose control of the ball. The power behind the ball comes from your foot, not from your leg.",
                "Lift one knee so that it is perpendicular to your body. Doing this will keep your thigh flat. A flat surface is much easier to juggle off of then an angular surface.\n\nTry to juggle with your thighs only after you have mastered juggling with your feet. Juggling with your thighs is a way to add versatility to your juggling skills. It will also allow you to keep the ball more in control.",
                "Hold the ball above your thigh. Let the ball drop onto the middle part of your thigh. If you bounce the ball off of your knee, it is almost guaranteed to go flying out of reach.[4]",
                "Juggle with your thighs the way you would juggle with your feet. Begin by bouncing the ball off your thigh and catching it. Repeat this process until you are able to control the direction of the ball and how high it goes with your thigh. Switch to the other thigh and repeat the process.",
                "Alternate between thighs. Do this when you feel confident that you can control the ball with both thighs.",
                "Alternate between your thighs and feet. Try kicking the ball with both feet and then both thighs. When you can do this without dropping the ball, try to bounce the ball off of each foot and thigh twice, then three times, and so on.[5]",
                "Juggle the ball with your head. Throw or kick the ball above your head and then bounce it off of your forehead. Angle your face up so that the ball will hit on the top of your forehead. Keep your neck relaxed and bend your knees. Bending your knees will help you to stay balanced while you focus on the ball above you.[6]\n\nYou can use the top of your head to juggle but you will have much less control of the ball. It can also hurt to juggle with the top of your head--try to avoid doing this.",
                "Use your shoulders. While shoulders are hard to juggle with because they are not flat, you can use them to direct the ball where you want it to go. When you kick the ball up to your shoulder, move your shoulder upward and in the direction you would like the ball to go. For instance, you can kick the ball up with your right foot and then hit the ball with your right shoulder so that it arcs over your body and falls so that you can kick the ball up with your left foot.[7]\n\nMake sure to only use your shoulders and not your upper arm. Hitting the ball with any part of your arm besides your shoulders is considered a ‘handball’.",
                "Practice using your head, shoulders, and chest. Use the pattern of foot-chest-thigh-shoulder-head and repeat to get comfortable with using your shoulders and head.\n\nPractice these techniques with a friend to create a variety of game-like scenarios.\nWhen you feel comfortable with this pattern, switch it up and practice another pattern such as head-chest-foot-shoulder-thigh."

            "steps": [
                "Acquire a cooler.\n\n\nLook for a beat up cooler at a thrift store or garage sale. As long as it seals at the top, paint can cover other superficial damages.\nBuy a cooler at a box store, such as Walmart or Target. Plastic coolers range from $20 to $100.",
                "Choose a cooler without wheels for the easiest painting. The more flat surfaces, the better, since you will be able to apply paint directly.\n\n\nA cooler with a flat surface is better than a cooler with a ribbed surface.",
                "Survey your cooler. If you have dents or an indented logo, you will want to follow this step.",
                "Fill in the indentations with spackling paste and a putty knife. This paste is available at most home improvement stores, just like primer and other painting tools.",
                "Follow package directions when using putty. Wait approximately 12 hours for it to dry.",
                "Use a heavy grit sandpaper to smooth the surface of the cooler. Sand all the surfaces that you plan to paint.",
                "Follow up with a medium to fine grit sandpaper.",
                "Hose the cooler down. Then, wash it with a mild soap. Rinse well and allow it to dry.",
                "Apply a plastic primer to the surface of your clean cooler.",
                "Move the cooler outside. You will want to do all of the priming and painting outdoors.\n\n\nFor best results, try a primer especially made for uneven plastic surfaces. Look for Rustoleum Fusion for Plastic or a similar product. The spray paint allows for easy and fast application.",
                "Allow it to dry well. Apply 2 coats, if recommended by the manufacturer.",
                "Find a design on the Internet, if you do not already have one in mind. You can print out stencils and logos.",
                "Buy tracing paper. Copy the design over to the tracing paper if you have printed out designs.",
                "Hold the tracing paper onto the cooler and trace, leaving lines where you will paint with different colors. You can also draw freehand onto the cooler with a pencil, and use the lines to guide your painting.",
                "Buy acrylic paints in the colors of your choice. You can also buy a bulk paint, like Gesso, and mix your own colors.",
                "Buy paint pens to complete small details and wording. Outlines and small illustrations are much easier with these pens.",
                "Apply the paint to your cooler, making sure it is thick enough to cover the surface. Take your time to ensure you fill out the design completely.\n\n\nUse blue painter's tape to form straight lines. Put the paint onto the primed surface. Then, take it off afterward and paint the outline of the tape.",
                "Paint 1 side at a time. Do not tilt the cooler onto painted sides, while the paint is still curing.",
                "Let the cooler dry for 24 hours when you have completed your design.",
                "Apply a coat of polyurethane sealer, such as Minwax Polycrylic. Make sure you apply an even coat.",
                "Allow the coat to dry completely. Apply 1 to 2 more coats.\n\n\nThe care you take with sealing your painted cooler will determine how long the paint job lasts."

        "How to Sing In Church Without Feeling Embarrassed": {
            "intro": "Singing in church can be one of the most potent forms of worship. Feeling embarrassed or nervous about singing in public is a normal reaction that can be overcome through improving your confidence and developing your singing voice. Ultimately, it's more important that singing makes you happy than if it sounds good.",
            "steps": [
                "Let go of past embarrassment. What has already happened is over; you've survived. Don't drag yourself down by dwelling on old events.\n\n\nThink about why you felt or still feel embarrassed. Making mistakes is part of being human. If your anxiety stems from having unreasonable expectations, remember that you aren't perfect.\nLaugh at yourself.[1] We may be in the age of humiliation[2], but it only matters if you internalize it.\nAssess your strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Being humble about your abilities will help you feel confident about what you can accomplish.\nBe responsible for your errors. If your embarrassment stems from a simple mistake, owning up to it is the first step towards being getting over it and being confident.",
                "Embrace your unique voice. There are many types of voices, and just because yours is different doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad [3]\n\nDon't apologize for your singing voice. There is no true right or wrong voice.\nSinging, especially in church, is about the happiness and meaning the act brings you, not necessarily about how you sound.\nConcentrate on group singing. Your voice may blend better when singing with the congregation or the choir.\nRemain hopeful no matter how you sound. Use positive reinforcement and convince yourself you sound fine. Tell yourself, \"It doesn't matter what happens. I will persevere and sing with my heart.\"",
                "Find out why singing is meaningful to you. The act of singing in church is considered a form of prayer. Focus on the fellowship. It is referenced within the Bible as being a way to praise God: \"Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,\" Ephesians 5:19. [4]\n\nWhat makes singing powerful is the positive feelings it can bring. \"Come let us sing for joy to the Lord,\" Psalms 95:1.\nRemember that you are singing for a community, which can be both comforting and empowering. There is nothing but love and support in the congregation.\nSearch for a song that conveys your feelings of love, worship, and faith. There are even some contemporary songs that have deep religious meanings.",
                "Work on your singing technique. Improve your posture, breathe correctly with your diaphragm, and use the appropriate throat technique. Having the right technique can make a significant difference in how you sound.\n\n\nAlways do a proper warm-up before singing. It will help your voice to sound its best and will prevent potential injuries.\nAn easy fix to performance anxiety while singing is to slow your breathing down. [5] Getting embarrassed can cause your breathing to become rapid and shallow, which can affect your voice.\n\nImprove your voice without lessons by working on scales. The melodic start of \"Do Re Mi\" is familiar to us all, and helps train ears to hear correct sounds regardless of the key.",
                "Practice! Your voice is formed by several muscles, which require diligent exercise. Training your singing voice to sound differently takes practice everyday.\n\n\nSing as often as you can; sing in the shower, sing in the car, sing around the house. Practice anything from humming your favorite commercial ditty to singing church hymns.\nRecord and listen to yourself singing to gauge your pitch, technique, and overall sound. It can help you recognize the improvements you've made. Also, hearing your voice repeatedly played back can help you become more comfortable with how you sound.\nRestrict your singing time. Focus on practice sessions of 20 minutes per day. Practicing too long can cause undue stress on the vocal muscles and put you out of commission for an extended period.[6]",
                "Join a choir. Participating in choir is not only a great opportunity to boost your community involvement, but it's a perfect learning opportunity to improve your singing technique and bolster your confidence.\n\n\nBy singing in a group, you may feel less isolated and self-conscious than in singing individually.\nThere is evidence that regular participation in group choral activity can greatly improve physical and mental health. [7]\n\nTry harmonizing. Your singing voice may not currently be strong enough individually, but as a complement to the primary melody your voice may resonate beautifully.[8]",
                "Take private singing lessons. The assistance of a professional voice coach can help you improve on your vocal range, singing technique, and confidence. Lessons can range in cost from $10-$75 for a half-hour, depending on the area and the voice coach's expertise and reputation.\n\n\nBe sure your vocal coach diagnoses your vocal status. Not only do you both need to know your current abilities, but there also needs to be an expectation of the desired outcome.\nDo your research on voice coaches in your area to decide which option is best for you. There are even online vocal coaches if you can't find someone perfect in your area.\nA voice coach can help, over time, make your voice sound the best it can be. They can't make you sound like someone else or make you immediately sound amazing. Be patient and reasonable.",
                "Solicit your friends. Close acquaintances and friends will be more likely to critically evaluate your voice. Sing for few friends to gauge their collective opinion of your abilities.",
                "Ask the choir for assistance. In most choirs there are bound to be countless years of experience and several strong voices. Seek opinions of those whom you admire, and follow their advice or guidance. They may even be willing to train you.",
                "Pick the music director's brain. Someone with years of musical experience may likely know how to help. He/she may suggest one of the following ideas:\n\n\nThere may be methods to accentuate the positives in your voice. Perhaps longer stretches of low notes or a specifically timed vibrato would work well.\nYour voice might be better suited to specific songs. A specific hymn that fits your range could really display your natural abilities.\nSimple voice control could be achieved more effectively via proper volume, chin position, and jaw angle.[9]",
                "Consult with a doctor about social phobia. There may be much more to your embarrassment than just your singing voice.[10]\n\nMillions of people are affected by social phobias that often extend to anxiety and depression.\nThe doctor may be able to help you if you are extremely self-conscious or worry excessively before singing. Treatment can potentially be psychotherapy, medication, or both.\nSocial phobias may extend simply beyond your singing. Don't let issue extend into other parts of your life."

        "wikiHow to Care for Leather": {
            "intro": "Leather is a classic material. Durable, stylish, and tough, a good piece of leather should last you a lifetime. However, like most things, you need to show your leather some love. The better you maintain your leather the longer it will last and the better it will look. It’s a special kind of material that you can’t just throw in the wash, so it’s important to understand how to maintain it.",
            "steps": [
                "Keep leather items out of the sun. The sun will dry the leather out and cause it to become brittle. Once your leather has become brittle it will become to crack and deteriorate.",
                "Keep the items in a cool, dry place when not in use. Mildew can deteriorate leather if it is allowed to grow on it. Don’t leave your items in a humid or wet basement – this could promote the growth of mildew.\n\n\nDon’t keep your leather in plastic either. Removing all air supply from the leather is bad for the material.[1]",
                "Keep leather away from abrasives that can scuff or cut it. [2] Once leather has been damaged, there is no way to repair it. Keep in mind that you can only prevent this to a degree, so don’t obsess over it. Try not to leave your leather on a gravel driveway, for example. However, throughout the lifespan of your leather something is bound to happen to it.\n\n\nMany people enjoy the look of worn leather and think its brings the material to life.\nYou also should avoid letting your leather get stretched out. For example, if you stuff a leather wallet too full it won’t go back to its normal size afterwards. If you want sleek, new looking leather you should avoid stretching it. [3]",
                "Add moisture to your leather. If you find that your leather is starting to dry out or crack it may be time to moisturize the material. Buy a leather dressing or a leather cream. If you can, contact the manufacturer of your leather to find out what they recommend. There are a number of oils and waxes that can help you reduce the cracks and dryness in your leather.[4]\n\nAdd leather dressing intermittently. Even if you haven’t used your leather item for many years, don’t just keep it stored in a glass display case. You need to dress the leather periodically.[5]",
                "Keep the leather clean. Try to brush your leather down with a damp cloth at least once a week. [6] If you are diligent about doing a quick clean of your leather then you won’t have to worry about deep cleaning later on, which is much more difficult.\n\n\nIf dirt particles get into the leather they can cause serious abrasion from the inside. [7]",
                "Use a damp cloth. Start by brushing off any dirt of grime from the leather with your hand, then switch to a damp cloth.",
                "Do not use any soaps or cleansers. These types of chemicals can remove the natural oils in the leather used to preserve the material. Chemical soaps will cause the leather to dry out, crack, and begin to deteriorate. Stick with water.",
                "Dry your leather slowly. [8] For example, if you have a leather motorcycle jacket and you are forced to drive in the rain you may have to live with it being wet for a little while. You shouldn’t put your leather by a fire, out in the sun, or near a heater to dry it off like you would with cotton or cloth. Dry your leather in room temperature by letting it sit.\n\n\nDrying leather quickly will change its chemical structure, causing it to become brittle and crack.",
                "Shine polished leather. Caring for polished leather is a little different than other types of leather. You'll need a dry rag, a can of shoe polish, and a shoe brush. Brush off debris using the brush, then add a nickel sized dollop of shoe polish to your rag. Rug the polish over the shoe and then use the brush again to give the shoe a little elbow grease.\n\n\nBuff out the rest of the polish with the rag. It should shine by the time you're done with it.[9]",
                "Keep suede leather dry. If you have an article of suede leather that gets very wet you should try to blot out as much water as possible using a paper towel. Like other types of leather, you should never apply heat.[10]\n\nIf you have a hat or a pair of shoes that got wet you should stuff them full of paper towels while they dry. An even better option would be some sort of mold about the size of you head or foot. This will keep the leather from shrinking and becoming misshapen as it dries.[11]",
                "Rub suede to clean it. Rub the suede with a dry bath towel rather than using water to bring up the shaggy nap of the leather. You can also use a pencil eraser lightly to rub out small stains from the suede.\n\n\nIf you're wearing suede shoes try brushing them lightly with a wire brush or a fingernail file.[12]",
                "Consider sending the suede to a professional cleaner. You can irreparably damage suede if you don't treat it delicately enough or use an unapproved cleaner. If your suede item is very valuable to you it might be worth it to invest in a professional cleaning.",
                "Store suede in the dark. Make sure that the dark place you leave your suede in isn't moist, because removing mildew from suede is incredibly difficult. Transport your suede in a pillow case[13] instead of a plastic bag so it can receive sufficient airflow."

        "How to Remove Scuff Marks from Car Vinyl": {
            "intro": "Removing unsightly scuff marks from your car’s vinyl surfaces is a simple task. You have a variety of options available, depending on the severity of the scuff. You can make your own vinegar-based cleaner or purchase a degreaser made for auto interiors. Spray your cleaner on the surface and use a magic eraser scrub pad to buff out the scuff. For deeper marks, you can order an easy to use scratch removing kit to make your vinyl panel good as new.",
            "steps": [
                "Create a homemade vinegar-based cleaner. If you don’t want to purchase a specially made degreaser or scuff remover, you can try making a homemade cleaner first. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water. Pour the mixture into a clean spray bottle.[1]",
                "Use a magic eraser to buff out scuffs. Whether a brand name or generic product, you can find magic eraser scrubbing pads at your nearest home goods, home improvement, or department store. They’re the easiest and most effective pad to use when buffing out scuffed or scratched vinyl. Further, they won’t wear away of the vinyl surface like a more abrasive pad would.[2]",
                "Spray the cleaner onto the scuffed surface and wipe. Spray enough to saturate the scuffed portion of the vinyl panel. Use the magic eraser to wipe it down using long, even strokes. Wipe away residue with a microfiber towel when you're finished.",
                "Try adding baking soda to your cleaning solution. For deeper or more serious scuffs, you may need a little extra abrasion. Try adding enough baking soda to form a thin paste. If you've added a cup (240 mL) each of water and vinegar, try adding two or three tablespoons of baking soda. Mix well until the baking soda is well suspended.[3]",
                "Purchase an auto interior degreaser. Purchase a degreaser concentrate if you’ve already tried wiping the surface down with a homemade cleaner, or if you just want to use a professional-grade detailer. You can find degreasers for car interiors at your local automotive or home improvement store.[4]\n\nSince it’s a concentrated product, you’ll have to dilute the degreaser when you’re ready to use it.",
                "Dilute your degreaser in four parts of water. If you’re using a store-bought degreaser, you’ll need to dilute it before using it on your car vinyl. Mix one part degreaser with four parts of water. Then pour your solution into a clean spray bottle.[5]",
                "Spray the scuffed surface and scrub. Spray your diluted degreaser or homemade cleaner directly onto the scuffed vinyl.[6] Scrub with your magic eraser using smooth, even motions until you’ve removed the scuff.[7]\n\nFor tight spaces that you can’t spray directly, you can spray the scrub pad. If the space is too tight for the scrub pad to access, try using a hard bristle toothbrush.",
                "Replace your pad as necessary. The vinyl surface texture will determine the number of scrub pads you’ll need. Smoother surfaces will most likely require only a single pad. If the texture is rougher or more rubberized, you’ll likely wear through a pad and will need to replace it as necessary until you’ve removed the scuff.[8]",
                "Wipe away residue with a microfiber towel. When you’ve finished buffing out the scuff, you’ll be left with residual cleaner and light debris. Wipe it away using a dry microfiber cloth. Using microfiber will leave you with a lint-free finish.[9]",
                "Purchase a complete scratch removing kit. Consider purchasing a professional kit if the scuff is more than just superficial or if you’re dealing with scratched vinyl. The kit will include a glue to fill in the deep scuff or scratch, an activator to dry the glue, and a dye that matches your vinyl color.[10]\n\nYou can order a scratch removal kit online for about 50 US dollars. Your kit will come with a factory-matched dye to blend in with your vinyl color. When you order your kit, you can search for your car’s make and model to identify the correct vinyl color.[11]",
                "Sand the scratched area. Use a piece of 220 grit sandpaper to smooth over the scratch or deep scuff. Try to remove any roughness around the scratch so its edges are flush with the vinyl surface.[12]\n\nSome scratch removal kits provide sandpaper. If you don’t have any fine grain sandpaper on hand, you can check kits’ contents before ordering and purchase one that supplies sandpaper.",
                "Clean the area after sanding. Wipe down the area with a damp cloth. If the area is greasy or grimy, clean it with a homemade vinegar solution or store-bought auto interior cleaner. Use a clean microfiber towel to dry the area.[13]",
                "Apply glue to the scratch and spread. If the area is still at all damp after wiping it down with microfiber, wait for it to dry completely before applying glue. Dab a small amount of the superglue that came in the scratch removal kit. Smooth the glue over the scratch using a narrow palette knife.[14]\n\nIf your kit provided a glue activator, apply it over the glue to instantly harden it.",
                "Sand and clean the glue when it’s dry. If you haven’t used an activator, wait for the glue to dry completely. Use your 220 grit sandpaper to smooth over the glued surface. Then wipe down the area with a damp cloth, and dry it with a microfiber towel.[15]",
                "Apply multiple light coats of factory-matched dye. The dye will come in an aerosol sprayer. Spray a light, even coat over the patched area, and hold a piece of cardboard under the area to help protect surrounding surfaces. Wait for the dye to dry, and reapply until you’ve achieved even coverage.[16]\n\nIf you have a heat gun handy, you can use it to dry the dye faster. Hold it about 12 inches (about 30 cm) away from the dyed surface."

            "intro": "Merging onto the highway is one of the more stressful lessons we all learn in driver's ed. Because highway conditions (and other drivers) are unpredictable, it's difficult to apply the same rules to any given situation. Understanding traffic laws and having good driving reflexes are key to merging on the highway safely. See Step 1 to learn all you need to know about how to merge without crashing.",
            "steps": [
                "Accelerate to the same speed as highway traffic. The first step of merging safely is to make sure you're going the same speed as the traffic on the highway. Use the acceleration lane - the entrance ramp or place where you're entering the highway - to quickly gain speed.\n\nMerging at the same speed as the other highway traffic will ensure that you don't create a dangerous situation when you merge, with cars coming up too fast from behind.\nLook in your mirrors and pay attention to the other cars while you're accelerating. You may need to wait a beat or two before accelerating to full speed if you see a line of cars coming up quickly in the lane into which you're trying to merge.",
                "Put on your turn signal. Do it early, so other drivers know what you intend to do. This gives them time to make any necessary adjustments. However, keep in mind that as the person merging, you don't have the right of way. Other drivers are not expected to move out of the way; rather, they'll keep going at the same speed, and it's up to you to make sure you adjust your speed and merge safely.",
                "Look for a gap in traffic. If traffic on the highway is heavy, you'll have to find a gap before you merge. Keep your eyes on the road, but check your mirrors and look behind you to figure out when it's safe to go. At the same time, maintain an appropriate speed to allow you to merge safely into the flow of traffic.\n\nLook in the internal rearview mirror, then at your driver's side mirror.\nGlance to see that there is no car in your blind spot (close behind you in the lane that you are merging).\nCheck whether someone has slowed or stopped in the ramp/merge lane in front of you.",
                "Merge when it's safe to do so. When you see a gap, ease your car into the lane. You should now be driving at the same speed as the rest of the traffic. Pay attention to the cars around you as you merge; you'll need to be able to react quickly if someone brakes in front of you or tries to enter your lane.",
                "Check other cars' \"body language\". Technically, cars in the merging lane are supposed to continue at the same speed, making it the responsibility of the person merging to find a gap and ease into it. However, every driver behaves a little differently, so it's important to pay attention to what's going on and make decisions based on reality.\n\nIf you see a car behind you that seems to be slowing down, the driver is probably trying to \"let you in\"; accelerate and take the person up on the favor. The same goes if you notice cars moving out of the merge lane to make room for you.\nIf you see a car that seems to be speeding up, let the person pass before trying to merge.\nSometimes drivers will wave you in with their hands, too.\nNever assume others will use the correct speed. It's up to you to react to what happens.",
                "Create gaps in front and behind you. As you merge, you want to maintain a nice distance from the cars behind you and in front of you. This provides a little buffer in case the car in front of you brakes, forcing you to suddenly slow down. Practice accelerating at just the right speed, so that you're not coming up on cars too quickly or slowing things down behind you.",
                "Never merge abruptly. Do your best not to jut into the lane into which you're trying to merge. Other drivers might not see you. Make sure you use your turn signal, and make eye contact if possible.",
                "Don't come to a stop in the merge lane. If traffic is bad and you don't see any gaps, you might be tempted to come to a stop. This is not a good idea, because it takes too long for a car to accelerate from 0 to 65; when you try to start moving again, it'll be dangerous for both you and the other drivers. By putting your turn signal on right away, accelerating to the speed of traffic, and making eye contact with the driver behind you, you should be able to create a gap.[1]",
                "Be kind when you see others merging. Ease off the gas a bit if someone's trying to merge onto the highway in front of you, or speed up if that's the safer option. Stay alert and try to make things easier for the other drivers - it makes the highway safer for everyone.[2]"

                "Review the \"front of pack\" labeling. When you're shopping and are on the lookout for preservatives, there are a variety of places on food packaging that can help you determine whether or not you want to buy that product.\n\n\n100% organic foods are also not always preservative free. By legal definition, only 95% of the ingredients or additives of a 100% organic food need to be organic. In addition, there are 45 additives that are actually permitted in organic foods.[3] These are there as they have been deemed as \"essential\" to the safety of the foods.[4]\n\nThere are some phrases like \"all natural\" or \"natural\" that do not really have a legal definition within the FDA.[5] Many food companies use this terminology for marketing and advertising purposes. However, there are plenty of \"all natural\" foods that contain a variety of added sweeteners, natural flavors and preservatives.[6] Don't get fooled by this type of labeling.\nAfter reviewing any labeling claims on the front of the package, you will need to double check and verify with other labels on your food.",
                "Scan the entire ingredient list. The ingredient list is required and all food manufacturers need to include an ingredient list on their products. This is where you will find out what types, if any, of preservatives are added.\n\n\nThe FDA requires all food manufacturers to list every single ingredient contained in a food product on the ingredient label.[7]\n\nWhen reviewing the ingredient list, know that the first ingredient listed is the one found in the highest quantity. The last ingredient listed is found in the least or smallest quantities in the product.[8]\n\nPreservatives will be listed with a statement about their intended purpose. For instance, the ingredient list may declare “ascorbic acid to improve color retention” or “sulfur dioxide to prevent rotting.” This can give you an idea of why the additive is a part of the food.",
                "Decide to avoid all additives or only preservatives. Food manufacturers may add a whole variety of different compounds to foods for many reasons. Preservatives are only one type of additive that food companies use.\n\n\nIn addition to preservatives, you may also notice other types of additives. These can include: colorings, vitamins and minerals, added fiber, artificial sweeteners and additives to improve taste (when fat or sugar is removed from a product).[9]\n\nConsider the variety of additives and what you really want to avoid and what you consider to be \"OK\" to include in your diet. For example, many cereals contain added fiber, vitamins and minerals which are beneficial to your health. However, \"low-sugar” or “diet\" cookies may have some added artificial sweeteners or texturants that you do want to avoid.\nAll additives that are currently in use are approved by the FDA (in the US) and have been deemed safe for human consumption.[10]",
                "Make note of common preservatives and those you want to avoid. Although there are hundreds of food additives that function as preservatives, some of the most common appear in a wide variety of foods. Once you learn to identify common preservatives you can quickly avoid selecting foods with those preservatives in the future. You can also make a list or note certain additives, colorings or preservatives that you specifically want to avoid. You may also want to make a list of the foods or types of foods they are typically found in and avoid them as well. Some common preservatives and their uses are:[11]\n\nPropionates, ascorbic acid, and nitrates are all used to preserve and maintain freshness in foods.\nGlycerine is a humectant that keeps foods moist and prevents them from drying out.\nXantham gum is a popular thickener in foods.\nPectin and agar agar are used also used to thicken and stabilize different foods.\nModified corn or food starch helps increase the bulk of a food without disturbing its nutritional value.",
                "Shop the perimeter of the grocery store. This is a common saying that refers to mainly shopping and purchasing foods from the sections the line a grocery store's walls. This may help you avoid some preservatives.[12]\n\nMany health professionals recommend shopping the perimeter of the store as many of these foods are less processed and are typically considered \"whole foods.\"\nThe main sections on the perimeter include: the produce section with fruits and vegetables, the meat/deli counter, the seafood counter, the dairy case and also eggs and the frozen sections.\nMost foods in the aisles are much more processed and will also most likely having varying amounts of additives.",
                "Choose whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables. The produce section will have the most whole foods that are minimally processed.\n\n\nTypically fresh fruits and vegetables do not contain. Stock up on these foods to help decrease or avoid additives.\nNote that not all items in the produce section will be preservative-free. Items like pre-washed, pre-cut fruits and vegetables may have some additives to maintain freshness or color.\nRaw nuts and seeds are also good options for avoiding preservatives. These may be available in bulk bins near the produce or in a separate bulk section of your store.",
                "Purchase meat and seafood that is minimally processed. The meat, deli, and seafood counter will have a bigger range of processed items compared to the produce section.\n\n\nTry to stick to meats that are uncooked and in their more natural state. For example: raw, whole chicken, raw beef or raw fish.\nFor example, instead of pre-cooked chicken breasts, purchase an entire chicken or chicken breasts raw and prepare them yourself. Or instead of buying turkey deli meat, purchase a turkey breast to roast and slice yourself.\nAlso, don't always forego frozen items. Many times frozen meats and seafood do not contain additives because the freezing keeps them fresh and prevents spoilage.",
                "Be wary of the dairy case. The dairy and egg case is another area that has a wide range of processing and amounts of additives.\n\n\nEggs typically will be preservative and additive free as you cannot add anything to shelled eggs. They do range in what the chickens are fed and how they were raised. Also, liquid eggs and liquid egg whites may contain additives.\nYou may want to consider avoiding dairy foods with added sugars or flavorings and buy plain or unflavored items. For example, buy plain yogurt instead of fruited yogurts.\nCheeses like sliced or shredded cheese may have some additives to prevent the cheese from sticking to itself. Try buying blocks of cheese and slicing or grating cheese yourself. Also, watch out for highly processed cheeses, such as American cheese and Velveeta.",
                "Stick to minimally processed items in the freezer aisles. The freezer aisles can contain very processed foods and minimally processed items. Be smart on what you choose.\n\n\nMany frozen fruits and vegetables are minimally processed and contain little to no additives or preservatives. Make sure you read the label to double check.\nFrozen fruits and vegetables that come with a sauce or gravy will have additives. Avoid these if you don't want to consume preservatives.\nMost other frozen foods will be processed and contain additives. Minimize these in your diet or avoid them all together if desired.",
                "Be mindful when shopping in the aisles. It will be difficult to purchase only foods from the perimeter to the store. When purchasing items from the inner aisles, be careful about what you choose.\n\n\nTry to avoid the aisles that contain candy, chips, crackers, cereals or cookies. These foods are guaranteed to be processed and contain a significant amount of additives.\nIf you're going to buy canned vegetables or meats, choose those with no salt added. Canning does a great job at preserving foods and therefore many of these items contain minimal additives.\nFor items like salad dressing, condiments or sauces, read the labels for those that contain more natural ingredients and less additives. This is a popular request by consumers, so with a little extra time with the labels, you should be able to find appropriate substitutes.",
                "Avoid heavily processed foods. Many heavily processed foods will contain additives. Minimize or avoid these foods to help you reduce the amount of additives you consume throughout the day.\n\n\nTop contenders for highly processed foods include: frozen meals, canned meals, deli meat, breakfast meats and processed meats, condiments, sauces and dressing, sweetened beverages, fast foods and chips/crackers.[13] Many sliced breads contain lots of preservatives as well.\nFoods that spoil quickly or that are minimally packaged are unlikely to contain preservatives. Buy fresh, unprocessed produce and natural whole foods to reduce the time you spend reading ingredient lists.[14]\n\nIf a food is processed and has preservatives, look for items that use more natural preservatives like salt, vinegar, sugar, citric acid or ascorbic acid.",
                "Cook from home and make items from scratch. If you want to get rid of additives in your diet, you'll most likely have to start making some foods from scratch or homemade.\n\n\nMaking items yourself allows you to control what goes into your foods and meals. You can control the calories, sugar, fat, salt and the amount of additives your foods contain.\nIf you're coming from a diet that contains large quantities of processed foods or those that contain a lot of additives, slowly start switching over to more homemade foods. Making changes very quickly is generally not easy or sustainable long-term.[15]\n\nSome examples of items you can make yourself include: salad dressings, sauces or marinades, bread, your own frozen vegetables or fruit, or your own \"freezer meals\" made with homemade items.",
                "Make a note of preservative-free products you enjoy. After you have identified foods that are free of chemical preservatives, add them to a “cheat sheet” list to take shopping.\n\n\nThis will spare you the trouble of re-reading the ingredient list on future grocery trips.\nIn addition, you can provide this list to family, friends or co-workers who may also be purchasing foods for you. They'll know exactly what to get.",
                "Avoid processed items when you go out to eat. If you choose to go out to eat, you may encounter some highly processed foods or those foods that contain a lot of preservatives. Be choosy about where you go out to eat to avoid this problem.\n\n\nMany restaurant are now advertising they use foods free of preservatives, all organic ingredients or meats without added hormones. Review the restaurant's website to verify if they truly use these types of ingredients.\nCall the restaurant in advance. Talk to a manager or a cook to find out what types of foods they are using to prepare their meals.\nAlso remember, that even if a restaurant claims to have hormone free meat, do their other products or foods contain preservatives? Check each ingredient used in their meal prep."

        "wikiHow to Make a Flea Trap": {
            "intro": "Flea traps are a great way to trap and kill fleas that are infesting a specific area in your house. You can make your own DIY flea trap at home with a few simple tools and ingredients that you probably already have on hand. It’s important to note, however, that while flea traps are useful for killing fleas in a localized area, they have to be used in conjunction with other flea-control methods in order to be truly effective.",
            "steps": [
                "Fill a large, shallow dish with water. Ideal containers for a dish soap flea trap include cookie sheets, rubber tote lids, plates, and pie plates. You want a container with a large surface area and short sides.[1]\n\nA shallow dish will help you catch as many fleas as possible, because the short sides won’t act as a barrier for jumping fleas that might land in the trap.",
                "Add dish soap. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of liquid dish soap to the water. Swish the water around with a spoon or your finger to distribute the soap throughout the water.\n\n\nFleas don’t drown in plain water because they aren't heavy enough to break the water’s surface tension.\nAdding liquid dish soap to the water reduces the surface tension. When the fleas jump into the trap, they will sink and drown.[2]",
                "Place the trap where fleas have been. A homemade flea trap doesn’t have the power to attract fleas, so it’s best to put it somewhere that fleas have already been in your house. Place a towel on the floor to catch spills, and lay the trap on top of the towel on the floor.[3] Make multiple flea traps for different rooms if necessary. Common places to find fleas include:\n\n\nOn carpets and rugs\nNear pet bedding\nNear windows,doors and food\nAround pillows and furniture\nAround pet bowls\nNear drapes and curtains",
                "Leave the trap overnight. Fleas become active a couple of hours before sunset and stay active all night long, so the best time to catch them is overnight. Once you lay the trap, try to leave it undisturbed for the rest of the night. When possible, close the door to the room to keep pets and kids out.",
                "Empty and refill the trap each morning. In the morning, check the trap for dead fleas. If you caught any, dump the soapy water and rinse the dish. Fill the dish with fresh water, add more dish soap, and lay the trap out again on the towel for the next night.\n\n\nRepeat each night until you stop catching fleas.[4]",
                "Use a lamp to attract fleas. Place a directional or table lamp beside the trap. Before bed, turn on the lamp and position the bulb above the trap, so the light shines into the trap. The fleas will be attracted to the light and warmth, and when they jump toward the light, they’ll land in the trap below.[5]\n\nUse an incandescent or other heat-producing bulb for your trap to attract the most fleas possible.\nMake sure the lamp is sturdy and not at risk of being knocked over into the water. Use this attractant only in rooms where you can shut the door and keep people and pets out while the lamp is on.",
                "Use a yellow-green filter on a light. Fleas are, for some reason, twice as attracted to yellow-green light as they are to other colors of light. You can increase the efficacy of your lamp attractant by using a yellow-green bulb, or by installing a yellow-green filter on a lamp with a regular bulb.[6]\n\nYou can buy colored light bulbs at many department and superstores.\nYou may be able to find filters and gels at camera and art supply stores.",
                "Place a candle in the center of the dish. You can also use a tea light to create light and warmth that will attract fleas to the trap. Place a tea light or votive candle at the center of the trap, and light the candle before bed. As the fleas try to get close to the source, they’ll fall into the trap and drown.[7]\n\nPlace the trap away from walls, drapery, and other flammable objects.\nAlways exercise great care and proper fire safety measures when burning candles.\nClose off the room to prevent people and pets from entering when the candle is lit.",
                "Place an indoor plant beside the trap. Fleas are attracted to carbon dioxide, and this is part of the mechanism they use to find a host. Because plants release carbon dioxide at night, placing one beside the trap may help to attract more fleas.[8]\n\nDormant flea pupae are particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide, so this may be a great way to catch young fleas before they have a chance to lay eggs.[9]",
                "Bathe and comb your pets. Pets are the most likely culprit for bringing fleas into your house, so keeping your pets clean and groomed will help stop the infestation at its source.[10] To treat your pet:\n\n\nComb your pet’s fur with a flea comb, concentrating at the neck and tail especially\nSwish the comb around in soapy water after each brush to kill fleas\nAfter combing, soak your pet with a hose or in a tub\nLather your pet’s fur with a flea controlling shampoo\nLeave the shampoo on the fur for a few minutes\nRinse your pet down\nRepeat regularly during the spring, summer, and fall",
                "Vacuum regularly. Adult fleas, eggs, larvae, and pupae can hide almost anywhere in your house, so you must vacuum three to four times each week to stay on top of them. Use a strong vacuum that will suck fleas and eggs from the nooks and crannies in your house.[11] Use a brush or nozzle attachment for hard to reach areas.\n\n\nVacuum floors, carpets, sideboards, furniture, around windows, and especially around areas where your pet spends the most time.\nAfter vacuuming with a bag-style vacuum, remove the bag, tie it tightly in a plastic bag, and remove it from the house immediately.",
                "Wash bedding, drapery, clothes, and rugs. Fleas and eggs won’t survive a trip through the washing machine and dryer, so launder everything that can go into the washing machine, and hand wash everything else. Use the hottest water setting and highest heat setting in the washer and dryer.[12] Items to wash include:\n\n\nBlankets\nSheets\nPillow cases\nPillows\nShoes\nClothes\nPet toys\nPet bowls\nTowels",
                "Consider an insecticide. Flea infestations can persist for months if you're not successful at removing all the fleas and their eggs. For stubborn infestations, use a pyrethrin-based pesticide with an insect growth regulator, such as Ultracide or Onslaught. Apply the insecticide inside and outside.\n\n\nGet everybody out of the house. Put on gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and a respirator to apply the insecticide. Use a dust or aerosol and apply a light mist on floors, walls, furniture, and all other surfaces inside the house. Allow the dust or spray to settle before letting people back in. Vacuum after 48 hours.\nOutside, apply a layer of dust or spray to the garden, on bushes and shrubs, around tall grass, in wooded areas, and around windows and doors."

Both are viruses, but the flu generally comes on faster than a cold and has a higher fever. They share similar symptoms including a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat so the same methods will work for fighting both.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Get plenty of rest. A healthy adult should get about eight hours of sleep at night. If you have a cold or the flu; however, you might find that you need a lot more.[2][3]\n\nGive in to the urge to take a nap. You might find that you wake up feeling much better.\nSleeping allows your body to direct more energy to your immune system, which will help you fight the infection faster.",
                "Stay hydrated. Your body loses water during a fever or when producing mucus. Be sure to drink enough so that you are replacing your fluids.[4][5]\n\nGood drinks include water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water. The juice, broth, and lemon water will also help replenish your electrolytes.\nDon’t drink alcohol or coffee because they are dehydrating.\nThe best way to avoid dehydration is to drink enough so that you do not become thirsty. If your urine is dark or cloudy, you need to drink more.",

                "Stay warm. If you have a fever, even a low one, it may make you feel cold. This happens because your body temperature is higher relative to the temperature around you.\n\n\nPut extra blankets on your bed or use a hot water bottle. However, don't overdo it with blankets. Over bundling, especially for babies, can actually increase your temperature and make you feel worse.\nKeeping warm will reduce shivering and let your body direct more energy to your immune system.",

                "Loosen phlegm or mucus with expectorants. Cough and cold medicines use an expectorant called guaifenesin. It helps to loosen phlegm or mucus in your lungs.[12]\n\nDrinking lots of water will also help to loosen phlegm.",
                "Suppress dry coughing with a cough syrup. This will only reduce coughing, it won’t actually make the infection go away. But if coughing keeps you awake, a cough syrup with the ingredient dextromethorphan might help you sleep.[13]\n\nWhen you cough, that is your body trying to expel the pathogens and irritants. By suppressing the cough, you are preventing that from happening. Talk to your doctor to find out whether cough syrups are right for you.\nDo not give cough syrups to children younger than four. For older children, follow the instructions on the bottle. If there are no instructions specific to your child’s age, consult a doctor.\nSome cough syrups have acetaminophen or other cold or fever/pain reducers in them. This means that it is important not to take them and other medications with acetaminophen at the same time. You could accidentally overdose.",
                "Get antiviral medications. If you are severely ill with the flu, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral.[14]\n\nCommon antivirals are oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).\nThese drugs don’t actually shorten the duration of the infection by very long. Usually it’s only about a day or two shorter.\nThe side effects may be more serious than the original flu. Oseltamivir may rarely cause delirium and self-harm in teenagers. Zanamivir cannot be taken by people with respiratory conditions. They may also cause vomiting.\nSome flu strains are becoming resistant.\nFor people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, taking antiviral medications for the flu may be more beneficial.",
                "See a doctor if you are showing signs of a severe infection. If you are an adult with the following symptoms or if your symptoms are getting worse or are not getting better by 5-7 days, you should be checked:[15]\n\nA fever that is 103°F (39.4°C) or greater\nA fever with sweating and chills\nCoughing up colored phlegm or phlegm with blood\nSwollen glands\nBad sinus pain\nTrouble breathing\nChest pain or a stiff neck\nBeing unable to drink enough fluids or vomiting frequently\nWorsening of any chronic medical conditions such as asthma, cancer or diabetes\nAre elderly",
                "Take your child to the doctor if necessary. Children have weaker immune systems and are more likely to have complications. Bring your child to be checked if they have:[16]\n\nA fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher when three months old or younger\nA fever of 104°F (40°C) or higher\nSigns of dehydration such as being listless or very sleepy, urinating less than 3 times a day, not drinking enough fluids, or dry eyes and mouth\nA fever for over 24 hours for a child younger than two\nA fever for over three days in a child over two\nVomiting more than once or twice\nAbdominal pain\nExtreme sleepiness\nSevere headaches\nA stiff neck\nProblems breathing\nCrying for a long time. Especially in children that are too young to say what’s wrong.\nEaraches\nA cough that doesn’t go away",
                "Get a flu vaccine every year. It will boost your immune system against the strains that doctors expect to be the most common in the coming year.[17]\n\nIt isn’t perfect, but it can really reduce how often you are sick.\nYou can get the vaccine as an injection or as a nasal spray.",
                "Wash your hands frequently. This will prevent you from infecting yourself with viruses that you may have gotten from shaking hands, touching handrails, etc.\n\n\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizers are also effective.",
                "Reduce your exposure by staying away from crowds. If you are in a small, confined space with lots of people, you are increasing the chances that at least one person near you will be carrying something. This includes:[18]\n\nSchools\nOffices\nPublic transportation\nAuditoriums",
                "Boost your immune system with a healthy diet. By eating well, you can give your immune system the energy it needs to quickly fight infections.[19]\n\nGet enough vitamins by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. Excellent sources of vitamins include apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, broccoli, peas, beans, spinach, cauliflower, squash, and asparagus.\nGet enough fiber with whole-grain breads and grains like bran, oatmeal, and whole-wheat.\nSupply your body with protein through lean meats, poultry, beans, fish and eggs. Avoid fatty meats.\nAvoid pre-packaged processed foods. They are more likely to be high in sugar, salt, and fat. They will give you calories, without also providing the nutrients you need.",
                "Manage stress. Stress can lower your immune system and make you more susceptible to infections. You can reduce stress by:[20]\n\nExercising. Try to exercise at least five times per week. This will cause your body to release endorphins and help you relax.\nGetting enough sleep. Most adults need about eight hours a night. Some people need as many as nine or 10 hours.\nMeditation\nYoga\nMassage\nHaving close relationships that provide social support. Talking will make you feel less alone.",
                "Try natural remedies. The effectiveness of these methods is controversial. Some studies say they help, others say they don’t; however, these are some frequently used remedies:[21]\n\nTaking vitamin C when you first start getting symptoms may shorten the length of time that you are sick.\nEchinacea may help the immune system. It is available in multiple forms, including tablets, liquids, and teas. Discuss it with your doctor if you are taking prescription medications.\nZinc may help if it is taken right when symptoms start. But do not use zinc nasal sprays. They can damage your sense of smell.",
                "Avoid smoking or exposure to smoke. Smoking weakens your body's ability to fight off illnesses including the flu and the common cold. By quitting smoking or avoiding smoke exposure, you will help to keep your body healthy.[22]"

        "How to Ride a Bike Safely": {
            "intro": "Riding your bike can be a great deal of fun, and it's a brilliant way to keep fit. Nevertheless, bike riding has its hazards, especially when you're sharing the road with motorized traffic. To keep safe, it is important to have a bike in top condition and to pay attention to some basic but very important cycling requirements when sharing your ride with the general traffic.",
            "steps": [
                "Check your cycling equipment. Before you even set out, it is important to ensure that your bike is roadworthy and safe. This is especially important for aging bikes. Checking your bike means looking at the following:\n\n\n\nAir -- are your tires inflated adequately?\n\nBrakes - do they work, are they clean?\n\nChain - is it clean, free of debris, and able to turn with no problems?",
                "Check the brakes. Wheel your bike around a flat surface, pulling the brake levers on and off. If they do not work, and you're not sure how to fix them, contact your local bike shop and ask them to help.",
                "Check the bike's tires. Put the whole tire into a small bowl of water. See if there are any bubbles coming out. If there are any bubbles, it means your tire is punctured and you can get it fixed by a bike shop or do it yourself. Repeat for the other tire.",
                "See if the bike is the right height for you. This is very easy as all you need to do is sit on your bike and make sure that the tips of your toes touch the ground (and nothing else). Adjust the bike seat as needed, and the handles too.",
                "Wear bright clothing, a reflective vest, or have flashing lights. These all increase your visibility. When buying t-shirts or tops make it a policy to buy bright or at least white colours. You can also add reflector lights or reflective tape to your backpack if you're wearing one.",
                "Wear comfortable shoes. Riding a bike in high heels or flip flops is never a good idea. Wear shoes that fit snugly, are flat soled, and have no dangling pieces that could become caught in the bike structure and spokes. Tuck in laces.",
                "Use trouser elastics or ties. They will hold back long pants that are threatening to flap into the wheel spokes, or become dirtied by the chain grease.",
                "Don't tie clothing around your waist. It could unexpectedly come loose and wrap around your wheel, throwing you head-first into the ground or road. It could also become entangled in the chain or obscure your rear light and reflector.",
                "Wearing a helmet is always a good idea when cycling. In some places, you have no choice but to wear a helmet by law. Yet, even where this is not legally required, it's a good idea to wear one to augment your safety - head injuries are the most common fatal injuries sustained in bike accidents.[2]",
                "Wear eye protection. Dirt, pebbles, or even bugs can fly into your eyes, causing temporary vision difficulty. A pair of bicycle-appropriate glasses will help prevent this.",
                "Know the rules and use your senses. Every cyclist has a duty to know the road rules, both as they apply to you as a cyclist, and as they relate to other road users as well. This includes teaching children what rules they need to be aware of (see below). It is also important to use common sense when riding in traffic, relying on all of your senses to help guide you through traffic safely. Anticipate the unexpected to reduce surprises.",
                "Ride in the direction of the traffic. Riding against traffic on the wrong side of the road is illegal and increases a cyclist's risk dramatically because it increases closing speeds and turning motorists are likely to not even look for traffic in the direction from which a wrong-way cyclist would be coming.",
                "Prior to adjusting course left or right, always first look back behind you to make sure it's clear, and then signal your intent. Learn to be able to turn your head to look back behind you without veering off course. This can be done by practicing looking back while following a stripe in an empty parking lot. This skill is essential any time you need to move left or right from your course, like when you need to move over for a truck stopped at the curb or some other obstacle. Just because it's not your fault that you need to change course, does not mean that you have right of way to move over. If other traffic is using the adjacent line of travel, you need to yield to them, or negotiate for right of way to move there (see below). It's important to practice the looking back skill because many cyclists, even experienced ones, don't realize how much they veer when they look back. Looking back to make sure it's safe to move over is of no help if you veer left right in front of overtaking traffic as you look back.",
                "Signal your intentions to other road users. That is to say when turning or adjusting laterally on the roadway. Holding your arm straight and parallel to the ground with open palm faced forward is much more clear and attention-grabbing than an arm halfheartedly lifted and held in position with a bent elbow. Before taking your hand off the handlebar, be sure to scan the road ahead for obstructions like stones, potholes, or anything that can jerk your wheel. Not only does signaling let them predict your next move, but it gives cyclists a reputation of courtesy.",
                "Stop for stop signs and watch for traffic.",
                "Obey traffic signals.",
                "Do not listen to music whilst cycling. Not only do your ears act like a radar for detecting approaching cars, certain types of music can encourage you to take excessive risks!",
                "Choose a conspicuous lane position. Realize that many motorists may overlook cyclists, especially those riding inconspicuously near the road edge. Some motorists are irritated by the presence of cyclists and seek to make it harder for you to drive near them. Don't get angry; if they honk that means they've noticed you! Convey gratitude by smiling, nodding or waving. Stay calm, keep your wits about you, and remain focused. A mirror can help you know when a motorist is approaching from behind. A well-timed look back, nod or even slow/stop arm signal can be very helpful in communicating to the motorist that you are not oblivious to their presence and your effect on them, which alone can often nip-in-the-bud a potential road rage situation.",
                "Track your tires at least five feet from the side of cars parked at the curb to eliminate the risk of being struck, or being caused to swerve in front of overtaking traffic, by a suddenly opened door. Remember that even at 10 mph you're traveling the distance of an entire car length every second. If a door opens suddenly in front of you, you may not even have enough time to react, much less stop. And if you instinctively swerve or are knocked left by the opening door, you could be hit by overtaking traffic. Sure, they're legally obligated to look first before they open the door, but are you going to trust your safety - perhaps even betting your life - that they always will without exception? If you regularly ride in door zones, it's only a matter of time before you get doored. Since car and truck doors extend out as much as three-and-a-half feet when open, tracking five feet away allows your two foot wide body to be clear of an open door plus a minimum of six inches of error margin. Any closer than five feet puts you in the door zone and in serious risk. Don't be lured into riding in a door zone by a bike lane. That paint on the ground offers no protection!",
                "Don't try to share lanes with other traffic that are too narrow for safe side-by-side sharing. Riding far right in lanes less than 14 feet (4.3 m) in width is a great cause of conflict and consternation in traffic. It makes the cyclist less conspicuous and invites motorists to try to squeeze into the lane side-by-side with the cyclist, causing them to either pass with insufficient safety margin, or realize too late that they have to at least encroach in the adjacent lane to pass safely. Alert them early of the condition that lane sharing is not an option by clearly controlling the lane by riding near the center of the lane, or even left of center, so they have the time and space to plan a safe lane change and pass.",
                "Share the road wisely. Between intersections when faster traffic is present, if the traffic lane is wide enough for traffic to pass you safely within the lane, keep to the side and make it easier for the drivers to leave you room. But during significantly long gaps in traffic, a more conspicuous position well out in the traffic lane helps grab the attention of the next driver who approaches, discouraging them from choosing to attend to a distraction until after you've been safely passed. A rear view mirror can help you notice when faster traffic is approaching, and to let you known when to move aside, usually after they've slowed indicating they've noticed you, but before they get irritated. Never use a rear view mirror glance in place of a head-turn look back prior to moving laterally on the roadway.",
                "Know that most of the risk is in front of you, especially from traffic turning and crossing across your path. As you approach any intersection, junction or place where turns may be made, regardless of your intended direction, choose a conspicuous and predictable lane position with plenty of buffer space around you. The savvy cyclist adjusts for the proper position at least 100–200 feet (30.5–61.0 m) prior to the intersection, if she is not already positioned there prior to that.",
                "Watch for cars on your right that are turning right. Turning motorists often check only for traffic where vehicular traffic is expected, sometimes overlooking pedestrians or cyclists positioned elsewhere. But sometimes they overlook even properly positioned cyclists (just like motorcyclists or even cars are sometimes overlooked), which is why the extra buffer space is important. Look for evidence that you've been noticed - and eye contact does not count (someone can look right at you and still not \"see\" you) - before relying on being noticed. Pay attention to where they are looking, which way their tires are turned, if they're rolling or completely stopped, etc. It's only a matter of time before someone overlooks you and cuts you off... so be ready and not surprised when it happens!",
                "Moving laterally on the roadway sometimes requires not only looking back and signalling, but often negotiation is entailed. Remember that signalling your intent to move does not give you the right of way to move. Any traffic already moving into that space needs to yield to you first. So signal clearly and look back, waiting for others to yield to you before moving. If you need to traverse across several lanes, move with looking back, signalling and negotiation for each lane change, one at a time, just as you would if riding a motorcycle.",
                "If you are turning left, use the left turn lane. Start preparing early so you have plenty of time and space to move across the road one lane a time with signalling and negotiation as needed. If you are not comfortable with this, pull over, get off your bike and walk it through the intersection using crosswalks based on pedestrian rules of the road.",
                "If you are going straight, don't use the right turn lane or the part of the road normally used by right-turning traffic. Other drivers are likely to not expect straight-through traffic to be traveling there. Prior to the intersection, move left if you're not already controlling the rightmost lane that goes straight.",
                "Don't pass slowing or stopped traffic on the right that can and might turn right. Instead, merge left to get behind them, or even further left to pass them on the left. Beware of motorists that pass you, and then slow down enough for you to catch up and start passing them... on the right. More often than not, they are slowing in order to turn right... that's you're cue to look back and merge left to pass them on the left. Don't shoot the gap! If you are passing stopped cars on the right, beware of the possibility of a passenger door suddenly opening - especially if it's a taxi. Passing on the left, with more than four feet of passing space, is much safer, and usually faster.",
                "Know the speed limits. It is important for you as a cyclist to avoid speeding, and to obey all speed limits in slow zones (such as around pedestrian crossings, and school zones).",
                "Know when to ride on the road, on the shoulder or in the bike lane. The rules will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but, generally, shoulder use is optional but never required, and bike lane use is generally only mandatory when faster traffic is present and they can be safely and reasonably used. Beware of glass, rubble and other debris that tends to collect in shoulders and bike lanes because they are not being continually swept clean by vehicular traffic as the rest of the road is. Take into account the extra risk you assume by riding as far right as bike lanes and shoulders usually are because you are less conspicuous there (less conspicuous to drivers approaching from behind as well as to those ahead of you). Being so far right also shortens your sight lines to potential hazards in front of you, and reduces the amount of safety/buffer space between you and potential hazards near the edge of the road. In short, decide where to ride by imagining where you would ride if there was no stripe per the considerations given above, and ride there. Remember that stripes are in fixed locations, and the best location for you to ride depends on the current situation and conditions, so don't blindly rely on bike lane stripes for guidance.",
                "Don't ride in bike lanes that are marked within the door zone of parked cars. Remember that bike lanes are usually only 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) wide, so even if it's a relatively wide 5' bike lane adjacent to parked cars, you should not ride in that bike lane. The closest you should be to the parked cars is by tracking on the bike lane stripe.",
                "Use of cycle tracks running next to the road are rarely legally required, but can be preferred, especially for relatively slow recreational riding. Even more than when riding in bike lanes, be aware of the additional risk assumed by riding where traffic is easily overlooked, whenever approaching any intersection with a road or driveway.",
                "Avoid cycling on the sidewalk or footpath. Generally, it is not a good idea to ride on the sidewalk and in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to do so. One clear exception to this is where a sidewalk has been specifically designated as a marked bike path but be careful still, as it is likely you will still need to share it with pedestrians, as well as cyclists coming in the opposite direction. On the whole, many roads are generally smoother, making the ride easier, quicker, and more comfortable than trying to navigate a bumpy, frequently obstructed sidewalk.",
                "Take extra caution when cycling in wet conditions. This is especially true if these are the first rains for some time: oil and grease in the tarmac is free to float on the surface. Therefore do not lean into curves and be wary of slick markings and drain covers. In icy conditions extreme caution is required, but consider delaying your journey until after midday or canceling it altogether. Having large wheels will help you ride in wet conditions.",
                "Cross railway/railroad lines at right angles. The tyres can otherwise get caught in the tracks, or when wet the wheels will slip.",
                "Always carry identification, like a medical ID bracelet or ID card in your seat bag. This can be invaluable to EMS responders if you're unconscious.",
                "Use appropriate lighting. Motorcycles are required to have a front headlight on at all times, because they are smaller and harder to see than other vehicles. A bicycle is smaller yet. Nighttime riding usually requires a front white light as a minimum, although adding other lights will help to increase your visibility, along with reflective clothing as discussed above. Lighting is useful both for day and for night riding:\n\n\nDuring the day, a flashing front light is good because it attracts more attention.\nAt night, use a constant front light rather than a flashing one. Its steady stream of light will provide adequate visibility to drivers, while a flashing front light at night soon gets to be annoying as it strobes your view.\nWhenever it gets dark outside, turn on your headlight. This means the moment that you feel your eyes straining to see well, even if the sky is not pitch black; remember too that drivers need to see you during twilight, so err on the side of turning on the light earlier rather than later.\nPut a red LED strobe or beacon on the back of your bike or your helmet. It is OK for this light to flash or have special patterns, because it disrupts night vision less than the white front lights, and because drivers do not count exclusively on your rear light to gauge their distance.",
                "Use conspicuous lane positioning. Riding a few feet one way or the other might not seem like it should make a big difference in terms of being seen since you should be in someone's field of view either way, until you think about drivers' \"zone of attention\" rather than their field of view. Being within their field of view is usually not enough to be noticed - you have to be in a place that makes you relevant to them to be noticed - be where they are paying most of their attention. While being in the \"motorcyclist position\" in the traffic lane does not guarantee that you'll be noticed, it makes being overlooked much less likely, and gives you a better vantage and more buffer space from hazards. Also, if you have a mirror, being well out in the lane makes it easy to determine when you are noticed, since motorists obviously slow down when they notice a cyclist up ahead in \"their lane\". If you're off to the side, then they often don't slow down even if they do notice you, so you have no way to discern those who have not noticed you from those who have. You can always temporarily move aside to let faster traffic pass, as being conspicuously well out in the traffic lane is the best way to be noticed.",
                "Take care at night. Cycling at night can be extremely dangerous. Always travel on a well lit road or path with no debris or potholes. Go slower than you would in the daytime, as you still need enough time to react to danger, and the lower visibility makes night cycling dangerous for this reason.",
                "Use hand signals properly. Hand signals are vital if you are going to turn. This is especially important for left turns, because they involve crossing traffic. Ignore what you were told in elementary school; instead, if you are turning left, extend your left arm, and if you are turning right, extend your right arm. Signals that were once based on the left arm were devised for driving a car, a situation where only the left arm can reach out the window.",
                "Give adequate warning. When you are passing pedestrians or other cyclists, it is essential that you warn them of your presence. Not only is this polite, but it reduces the chance of collisions, because pedestrians are less likely to suddenly swerve into your way, and they may move over, keeping you out of traffic. A bell, or a loud voice \"On your [Left / Right]\", \"Passing\" are good ways to attract attention.",
                "Watch for parked vehicles. When riding past parallel-parked vehicles, leave enough room for the vehicle door to swing completely open just as you are about to pass. Getting \"doored\" can cause serious injury and even death.",
                "Teach your children how to ride safely in a completely safe place. Let children learn at their own pace and offer lots of encouragement. They will fall off, so be prepared with hugs and motivational talk to get them back to trying. Be patient at all times.",
                "Ensure that children always wear a helmet when riding. This should feel like \"second nature\" to them.",
                "Explain to older children that riding at high speed could seriously hurt them. Discourage them from doing this and warn them about the dangers of not holding onto the handle bars or going down steep hills too fast.",
                "Find safe places for children to ride for fun, and safe routes to school and other places. As a person responsible for your children's well being, it is up to you to take the time to scout out good routes and places with your children where they can ride in safety."

        "How to Tell the Sex of Guinea Fowl": {
            "intro": "Guinea fowls are becoming increasingly popular. Not only is their meat tender and flavorful, but guinea fowls also protect the farm flock from predators, serve as pest control, and can even reduce the deer tick population that is responsible for Lyme disease.[1] Whether you have just one or several guinea fowls, it will be important for you to tell the different between the males and females.",
            "steps": [
                "Wait until the guinea fowls are older. The sex of a guinea fowl can be determined most reliably by its vocalizations. Guinea fowls do not begin to vocalize until they are about 8 weeks old.[2] If you have young guinea fowls, known as keets, wait until they are around 2 months old before listening for their vocalizations.[3]\n\nFemale guinea fowls may not start vocalizing until much later in life, so you may have to wait even longer to determine the sex of your guinea fowls.[4]",
                "Listen for the call of a male guinea fowl. Male guinea fowls make a 1-syllable call that sounds like ‘chek.’[5] The male’s vocalization will either be a chirp or a yelp repeated at varying intervals.[6] The vocalization has also been compared to the sound of a machine gun.[7]",
                "Listen for the call for a female guinea fowl. This is where things can get a little tricky, since female guinea fowls also make the 1-syllable ‘chek’ sound. However, females also make a 2-syllable call that can sound like a variety of words, like ‘buckwheat,’ ‘put-rock,’ or ‘qua-track.’[8] Typically, the first syllable will be short and the second syllable will be longer and rising in tone.[9]",
                "Observe the wattles. Wattles are flaps of skin that hang from a bird’s head or neck. Although male and female guinea fowls look very similar, it is possible to tell the sex by looking at the wattles. In adult male guinea fowls, the wattle is usually large, elongated, and folds upward toward the upper jaw. A female guinea fowl’s wattle will look fairly flat.\n\n\nThe female guinea fowl’s wattle is usually smaller than that of a male guinea fowl.[10]",
                "Look at the size of the helmet. A guinea fowl’s helmet, also known as a casque, is a prominent horn-like structure on the top of its head.[11] The helmet is larger on males than females.[12] The helmet on female guinea fowls tends to be short and narrow.[13]\n\nBe aware that helmets can look very similar between males and females.",
                "Do not rely on visual differences. Because male and female guinea fowls look similar, you should not use only physical characteristics to differentiate between the sexes. In fact, keets look nearly identical, making it that much more difficult to know the difference between males and females.[14]",
                "Turn the guinea fowl upside down. Another way to tell the sex of a guinea fowl is to examine the vent, which is the genital area of a bird that controls the elimination of bodily fluids.[15] To perform vent sexing, use one of your hands to turn the guinea fowl upside down and push its tail towards its head. Consider having a friend help you with the procedure.[16]\n\nIt would help to be seated and rest the guinea fowl's back along the length of your leg.\nVent sexing can be difficult to perform and may injure a bird. If you are not comfortable performing the procedure, have a bird expert do so.\nVent sexing is usually performed in keets that are at least a few weeks old.",
                "Expose the cloaca. The cloaca is the circular opening where reproductive, urinary, and digestive fluids exit a bird’s body.[17] With your other hand (or the hand of your friend), place an index finger and thumb on either side of the vent. Gently separate those fingers to stretch and push out the cloaca. Use gentle, yet firm pressure when exposing the cloaca.[18]",
                "Examine the phallus. Typically, it is very difficult to differentiate between the sexual organs of male and female birds. A male guinea fowl’s phallus is longer and thicker than that of a female guinea fowl. The phallus becomes more distinguishable between the sexes at around 8 weeks of age.[19]"

        "How to Care for a Hibernating Turtle": {
            "intro": "Hibernation for cold-blooded animals is called \"brumation.\" Many species of temperate-climate turtles and tortoises brumate, or hibernate, in the winter.[1] Captive tortoises and turtles don't need to hibernate to survive, but annual hibernation periods can increase your odds of breeding success.[2] Research the needs of your specific pet, and follow these guidelines to safely prepare and care for your hibernating turtle or tortoise. Do not force a sick animal to hibernate, and be wary of drowning, freezing, and starving your pet by accident.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine if your species hibernates. Generally, turtle and tortoise species from tropical climates close to the equator do not hibernate; the farther away from the equator, the more likely that your pet hibernates.[3] Research your specific animal's' requirements before you begin. Species that commonly hibernate are listed below: [4]\n\nBox turtles\nRussian or Horsfield's tortoises\nSpur-thighed tortoises\nMarginated tortoises\nHermann's tortoises\nDesert tortoises\nGopher tortoises\nTexas tortoises\nWood turtle\nSpotted turtles\nRed-eared sliders\nSnapping turtles",
                "Get a vet to check your pet’s health. Only healthy animals should hibernate. During hibernation, the immune system slows down considerably, and a turtle that was even mildly ill going into hibernation is likely to die during or shortly after the process. Examine your turtle carefully for signs of illness. Even if you see nothing, still have the turtle examined by a veterinarian.[5][6] Signs of illness include:\n\n\nSwollen eyes.\nDischarge from the nostrils\nSwollen ears\nLow body weight\nDifficulty breathing, exhibited by opening the mouth frequently\nAquatic turtles remaining out the water at night\nAbscesses or other signs of parasite infestation\nWounds or shell rot\nStrong smell,inflammation, or leaking liquid from underneath the tail\nInside the mouth, any of these: the appearance of small blood-spots; deep red-purple tinge; a yellow cheesy substance",
                "Learn how your pet should hibernate. Most experts recommend that you keep your indoor turtles and tortoises indoors and active during the winter, and that you bring outdoor turtles and tortoises inside for the winter if their natural habitat will not be safe.[7]Aquatic turtles can hibernate outdoors as long as it is safe and the water doesn’t freeze. Terrestrial and semi-aquatic turtles and tortoises can hibernate indoors and outdoors. If the animal lives outdoors, it will respond to changes in the temperature and length of sunlight, and instinctively know when and how to get ready to hibernate. If your animal lives indoors, you will need to simulate these changes.\n\n\nCheck your local pet club information listings or ask your vet if you are unsure how to care for your pet.\nMost box turtles and tortoises hibernate between October or November until the late February through early April in the United States.[8]\n\nMost turtles and tortoises hibernate for 2-4 months. Some species in some regions can hibernate up to 6 months, though that length of time is not required. Ask your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your turtle.",
                "Weigh your pet. You should track your pet’s weight throughout hibernation to know if your pet is healthily losing weight or dangerously starving. Weigh your turtle or tortoise now to get a baseline weight, and keep weighing your pet every 2-3 weeks.[9]\n\nUse the same scale you will use leading up to and during hibernation.\nUse a digital scale for animals under 6 lbs (2.5kg) to ensure accuracy.",
                "Feed your pet vitamin A during the summer. Before you fast your turtle or tortoise, you should feed your pet higher levels of vitamin A since hibernation depletes stores of vitamin A. At the beginning of summer (12-16 weeks before hibernation), begin adding vitamin A-rich foods to the turtle's diet. You can simply swap out some of these foods for other things your turtle normally eats.[10][11] Some good sources of vitamin A include:\n\n\nFor tortoises: carrots and squash\nFor turtles (non-meat): Leafy green vegetables like kale, broccoli, mustard and collard greens, and dandelions; orange vegetables, like alfalfa, squash, carrots, sweet potatoes; orange fruit, like cantaloupe and peaches\nFor turtles (meat): fish and baby mice\nIf your pet already gets a lot of vitamin A, just keep feeding it as normal.",
                "Increase your pet’s fiber intake. Towards the end of summer (late July, or 6-8 weeks before hibernation), swap out some of your turtle's normal food for higher-fiber options. [12][13]\n\nGood sources of fiber for both turtles and tortoises include alfalfa and timothy hay, both which are high-fiber weeds and grasses.\nIf your pet normally eats a high-fiber diet, just keep feeding him as usual.",
                "Fast your pet 2-6 weeks before hibernation. Many turtles and tortoises die because owners hibernate them with undigested food still in their digestive tract. Do not try to hibernate a turtle or tortoise who has eaten within the last month; instead, delay hibernation.[14] Ask your vet for a specific fasting time for your species.\n\n\nUndigested food kills hibernating pets in 2 ways. Either the food decays and causes fatal bacterial infections inside your pet; or the food decays and creates large clouds of gas, which press internally on your pet’s lungs to suffocate it. When in doubt, contact your vet.[15]\n\nYour pet’s digestive system is controlled to a large extent by temperature.\nTortoises can need 3-6 weeks. [16] Small tortoises (<1kg) need 3 weeks; medium sized (1-1.5 kg) need 3-4 weeks; large tortoises (2-3kg) need 4-6 weeks.\nTurtles need roughly 2-3 weeks. A small turtle like a Box turtle might need only 10-14 days.[17]",
                "Hydrate your pet. While fasting, soak your tortoise or turtle every other day 20-30 minutes in chin-deep water. Ensure your turtle or tortoise has access to drinking water constantly, from now until the end of the entire hibernation. This helps encourage the tortoise to expel waste from its digestive tract and stay hydrated.[18]",
                "Decrease the temperature before hibernation. Temperature determines your pet’s metabolism, which is why hibernation happens when it is cold. Ensure that all food is out of your pet’s body before you go onto the next step. Do not go below 50°F (10°C).\n\n\nTurtles: start 1 week before hibernation. 65°F (18°C) for 2-3 days, gradually reduced to 60°F (15°C) over 2-3 days, then gradually reduced to 50°F (10°C) or a little below.[19][20]\n\nTortoises: start 4 weeks before hibernation. Gradually reduce temperature to 60°F (15°C) over 1 week, then keep temperature 55-60°F (13-15°C) for 3 weeks so your tortoise can fully digest its last meal.\n50°F (10°C) is the maximum (warmest) temperature for hibernation to occur. If your turtle or tortoise is at 50°F (10°C), they will begin to hibernate.",
                "Decide where your pet will hibernate. Most pet owners use fridges for indoor hibernation, but only with a lot of care and caution. Make sure your turtle or tortoise is completely safe from predators such as rats, which like chewing on hibernating tortoises.\n\n\nIf you have an aquatic turtle that is staying in water outdoors, make sure the water does not freeze and has a depth of at least 18 inches.\nIf your pet is staying indoors, scope out a cool location in your house for your turtle or tortoise. Many people use refrigerators. Others use garages, basements, or any room at room temperature.\nPick a location that stays above 50°F (10°C) as its default. If your power goes out, your pet escapes, or another accident occurs, you want your turtle or tortoise to live despite the temperature change.",
                "Prepare your fridge, if needed. If you are choosing to place your pet in a fridge for hibernation, you must watch your fridge and pet carefully to avoid death.\n\n\nVentilate properly. A fridge is air-sealed, so you must provide air to your turtle or tortoise. Open the fridge door at least 3 times a week, for 1-2 minutes.[21]\n\nTest the fridge temperature. Place a thermometer in the fridge and monitor its fluctuations and accuracy. If there is a lot of temperature fluctuation, fill your fridge with other masses, like water bottles, that will hold the temperature steadier than just air will.[22]\n\nPick a fridge that you will not be using often throughout the day. Opening and closing the door often can deregulate the temperature, as well as flicker the fridge lights on and off.",
                "Check your pet regularly. Your tortoise or turtle might become less active, but it should still seem alert and reactive. If your pet is sick, listless, or otherwise abnormal, check with your vet. Do not go onto the next step: hibernation can kill a sick turtle or tortoise.",
                "Pick your boxes. A hibernaculum is a small container for your turtle or tortoise to hibernate, and it protects your animal from hazards. Take two boxes: one about twice or thrice the size of your animal, and one only a few inches larger than your animal. The smaller box should fit into your large box with an inch or two on each side.\n\n\nYour outer box should be made of sturdy material able to withstand chewing by rats. Use plywood, plastic, or wood. Do not use cardboard.\nYour turtle or tortoise should be able to turn around in the smaller box, but not wander a lot.",
                "Pick your insulation. This is a critical step. You need material to fill the gaps between the large and small box, when the small box is placed inside the larger one. This will help regulate your pet’s temperature, and keep your pet from dying or leaving hibernation too early.\n\n\nThe best insulation is polystyrene or packing foam. Alternatives include insulation from housing or packing projects. If you need, tightly packed shredded paper can work too.",
                "Add a thermometer. A thermometer is absolutely necessary for checking the temperature in your pet’s environment. You will be checking your thermometer often, so get one you understand and can use well.[23]\n\nMany pet owners like using a classic maximum-minimum reading thermometer from any garden or hardware store.\nSome pet owners like using thermometers with alarms that sound when the temperature gets above or below a certain reading.[24]",
                "Assemble your box. Place a bottom layer of insulation in the large box. Place your small box in the middle of the large box, on top of the layer of insulation. Add the rest of the insulation around the sides of the smaller box. Put insulation on the top lid of your boxes. Drill small ventilation holes in the lid. Cover the bottom of your smallest box with some substrate. Some examples of substrate include:\n\n\ncoir (crushed coconut husk)\nstraw\nshredded newspaper\npeat\nmoss\ncommercial substrates for reptiles, such as Carefresh or Bed-A-Beast\nDo not use substrate with fertilizers, plant food, or any chemical additives\nCheck the appropriate moistness of your substrate for your species of pet. For example, box turtles need very moist substrate that is almost wet.\nTurtles and tortoises use up very little oxygen when hibernating, but still require a small amount of oxygen. Make ventilation holes that are small (less than an inch or centimeter in diameter).",
                "Start hibernation. Make sure that your turtle or tortoise has no illnesses or injuries, no food in their digestive system, constant access to water, and is at a temperature hovering around or above 50°F (10°C). If any one of these things is not true, do not force your pet into hibernation. Otherwise, place your pet in the hibernaculum. Place your hibernaculum in a cool location where it will stay throughout hibernation, except for when you are inspecting it.\n\n\nIf your pet is hibernating outdoors in nature and not in a hibernaculum, make sure your pet will neither drown or freeze in its hibernation spot. Your pet should still have constant access to drinking water.\nIf your pet is hibernating outdoors, it will naturally bury itself in or around a pond. The pond should have a good bed of dirt or muck to dig into, and be at least 18 inches deep to provide some temperature insulation. If needed, keep the pond from freezing by using a floating pond heater through the winter.[25]\n\nIf your outdoor turtle will not hibernate, even though the weather has cooled, or you see it swimming or basking a lot after other turtles have disappeared, bring it inside. Some turtles just don't know how to hibernate and will not survive the winter outside.[26]",
                "Physically inspect your pet 1-2 weeks. You cannot hurt a hibernating tortoise or turtle by handling it, but can kill your pet by neglecting it. Do this regardless of where or how it is hibernating, indoors or outdoors. Inspect your pet for any signs of infection, illness, or poor hibernation; and inspect your hibernaculum for urine, feces, or signs of predation (rats).\n\n\nIf your 1) tortoise or turtle has urinated or defecated while hibernating, 2) your pet's skin is dry, or 3) hibernaculum is just much wetter than usual, soak your pet for 2 hours in room-temperature water. The water level should happen just below your pet’s bridge. Dry your pet thoroughly, and return your pet to the hibernaculum placed in a slightly cooler location: you had been keeping your pet in a location that was too warm and dehydrated your pet.[27][28]\n\nSigns of infection include discharge, breathing difficulties, and changes in the skin or shell. If you notice anything concerning, call your vet.\nIf your pet’s skin is dry or the hibernaculum is wetter than usual, soak your pet in room-temperature water for two hours.",
                "Stay at 40°F (4.5°C). An ideal temperature for hibernation is around 40°F (4.5°C), though your pet can hibernate 35-45°F (1.5-7°C).[29] Any lower and your pet might suffer permanent damage or death; any higher and your pet will burn too much fat to stay in hibernation, and will start waking up.\n\n\nCheck your thermometer at least once a day, if not a few times a day. Check hourly during very cold or hot times.\nIf the temperature is consistently warm or cold for a few hours, change the location of your hibernaculum to a place with a more optimal temperature.",
                "Weigh your pet. Every few days, weigh your turtle or tortoise on the same scale you used before hibernation. Keep track of your pet’s weight throughout hibernation. A healthy turtle and tortoise will lose 0-1% of its body weight for each month of hibernation. Some examples of normal weight loss:\n\n\nA 1 kg tortoise losing 10 g per month\nA 1.5 kg tortoise losing 15 g per month\nA 2 kg tortoise losing 20 g per month[30]\n\nIf your turtle or tortoise is losing weight faster than this, rehydrate your pet by sticking them in shallow room temperature water for 2 hours. The water level should fall just below the bridge on your pet. If your pet loses weight faster than this for more than a week, contact your vet.\nFor instance, a turtle or tortoise that weighs 600 grams should lose 6 grams a month.\nKeep these records for the next time you want your pet to hibernate.",
                "Remove your pet from the cold. Before you do anything, double-check the duration of time your turtle or tortoise is supposed to hibernate for; most species fall within 2-4 months. Remove the hibernaculum, if using, and warm your pet to 60°F (15°C). Soak your tortoise or turtle, as you have been, every other day.",
                "Increase the temperature. Keep your pet at 60°F (15°C) for 2 days. Increase to and maintain at 65-68°F (18-20° C) for 2-3 days. Finally, return your pet to non-hibernation temperatures (70°F-80°F, or 21°C-27°C).\n\n\nWaking up is a mirror image of going into hibernation. “Waking up” is characterized by more movement and activity. Drinking water is important throughout this process. However, your pet might avoid food.\nKeep the temperature warm. Temperature for critical in your pet’s metabolism, and cold temperatures can make your pet vulnerable to illness. Use a heat lamp or focal light to warm up your turtle or tortoise if it is not active or eating properly.[31]",
                "Hydrate your pet. Soak your pet in water 20-30 minutes every other day, as you have been doing so far. Still provide your pet with constant water to access. Your pet must drink to flush out the toxins in its kidneys accumulated from hibernation. If your tortoise or turtle does not drink and hydrate itself, see your doctor immediately. [32]\n\nUse a sink, bathtub, large deep food tray, or other \"bath\" container suitable to the size of your pet.\nTortoises \"drink\" through their anus, so this soak in water is the same as drinking it.",
                "Feed your pet. Begin offering food 2 days after the tortoise is returned to room temperature. Provide the same food as before, and let your pet take its time beginning to feed again.\n\n\nSome turtles take weeks to feed again, and males might feed only until after breeding.[33][34] However, if you see signs of vomit, upset stomachs, or any other illness or infection, see your doctor immediately.\nAll tortoises should feed within 1 week of hibernation. If not, your tortoise is sick or getting sick. See your vet immediately."

        "wikiHow to Compost in a Tumbler": {
            "intro": "Composting is an effective way to do something useful with kitchen scraps and yard refuse. It saves valuable landfill space and gives you rich, dark soil for gardens and planting. Many people avoid composting because compost piles are unsightly and have an unpleasant smell. Composting in a tumbler gives you improved aeration and the benefit of keeping your compost in a closed container. The tumbler method is simple. You start by filling the tumbler with compost materials, and then monitor the heat and moisture while the materials break down.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a tumbler. You can buy tumblers on the internet or at a garden supply store. You can also build your own. Pick a tumbler based on your needs. Remember that larger tumblers will take more strength to turn, but you will be able to compost more material at one time.[1]\n\nOne advantage to tumblers is that they are more aesthetically pleasing (and less smelly) than compost piles. You can put your tumbler anywhere in your yard that is convenient.",
                "Put organic materials into the tumbler. Composting takes advantage of organic scraps to make a nutrient rich soil. These scraps can be anything from egg shells and left over salad to grass clippings or dried leaves. Just open up the lid on your tumbler and throw in any scraps that you have from the yard or kitchen.[2]\n\nSmaller sized pieces are better. Try grinding or shredding any large materials before adding them to the tumbler.",
                "Balance your carbon and nitrogen. You want your end product to be a nutrient rich soil that can be used around your garden or home to grow things. Plants need a balance of carbon based and nitrogen based nutrients. You want your finished compost to have a carbon-nitrogen ratio of roughly 10-1. Adding a mixture of about 75% grass clippings and 25% kitchen scraps will typically put you in the right ball park.[3]\n\nThe best way to gauge your carbon to nitrogen ratio is to keep track of the things you put in your tumbler. You can find guides that give you the relative carbon and nitrogen content of different compost materials online.[4]",
                "Be aware of pesticides and contaminants. The microbes in the compost will break down some contaminants, but not all of them. If you want to avoid having pesticides and other contaminants in the plants you are growing, make sure that you don’t add them to your tumbler. You can use all organic ingredients to avoid getting pesticides in your compost.[5]",
                "Load the tumbler in batches. From start to finish, the compost can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. The important thing to remember is that this time frame is from the last scrap you put in, not the first. As the the compost forms, it will become more compact and make more room in the tumbler. This might tempt you to add more scraps, but be aware that doing so will restart the amount of time your compost will be in the tumbler.[6]\n\nInstead of continuing to add to the tumbler, you could have a compost bucket (or a second tumbler) that holds scraps until the current batch is finished. Then, you can move the second batch into the tumbler.",
                "Start the reaction. If you just put your materials in the tumbler, they will probably turn to compost on their own ― eventually. To make your composting process faster, you need to add some microbes to start breaking down the organic materials in the tumbler. There are several ways that you can do this:[7]\n\nAdd horse or cow manure to the tumbler.\nAdd garden soil to the tumbler.\nAdd a commercial composting mix to the tumbler. These can be found online or in a garden store.",
                "Turn the tumbler. The composting process requires air. In a tumbler, aerating is done quite easily. You simply turn the tumbler back and forth several times. Do this every two to three days for optimum aeration. The turning allows air to get mixed in with all levels of the compost.[8]\n\nTurning the composter too often will slow down composting.",
                "Place a pan underneath the tumbler. Most tumblers have a drain that allows liquid (known as compost tea) to drain out the bottom. You can collect this liquid in a pan or bowl underneath the tumbler. Pour the compost tea into your garden or use it to water your potted plants. This liquid is full of nutrients that will help your plants grow.[9]",
                "Watch the temperature inside the tumbler. Maintaining the correct temperature is crucial on two fronts for composting. First, a higher temperature will help break down the compost materials faster. Second, the compost needs to get hot enough to kill any unwanted pathogens and weed seeds. Measure the temperature with a thermometer. Ideally, it will be no lower than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).[10]\n\nIf your compost is not getting hot enough, you can add manure or commercial products to increase the nitrogen levels and provide more heat.",
                "Keep the compost moist. Proper hydration will keep the compost from clumping into a hardened mess, or turning into a slush. The compost should stay about as moist as a wet sponge that has been rung out. If your compost is too dry, you can add water directly to the mix.[11]",
                "Observe the color and consistency. Many composters will refer to green and brown composting materials. Keep in mind that this actually has nothing to do with the color of the materials or the compost. It actually refers to the carbon (brown) and nitrogen (green) content of the material. Your compost should be a dark brown.[12]",
                "Use the compost. Your compost is ready once it has a dark brown color and all of the materials have broken down. It will have a similar consistency to soil. Empty the tumbler and use the compost in your garden or potted plants. It will provide nutrients that the plants need to grow.[13]\n\nSome tumblers unload from the side. Others unload from the top or bottom."

        "wikiHow to Survive a Plane Crash": {
            "intro": "The odds of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1. That said, a lot can go wrong at 33,000 feet (10,058.4 m) above the ground, and if you’re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does, the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death. Almost 95% of airplane crashes have survivors, so even if the worst does happen, your odds aren't as bad as you might think. You can learn to prepare for each flight safety, stay calm during the crash itself, and survive the aftermath.",
            "steps": [
                "Dress comfortably. You’ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash. Even if that is not a consideration, the more of your body is covered during impact, the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns. Wear long pants, a long-sleeve t-shirt, and sturdy, comfortable, lace-up shoes.\n\n\nLoose or elaborate clothing poses a risk, as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane. If you know you’re going to be flying over cold areas, dress appropriately, and consider keeping a jacket on your lap.\nCotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable. Wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water, as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet.",
                "Wear sensible shoes. Although you may want to be comfortable or professional-looking on a flight, sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency. High heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them.",
                "Sit in the tail of the aircraft. Passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40% higher survival rates than those in the first few rows, in the event of a crash. Because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival, it’s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit, on the aisle, and in the back of the plane.\n\n\nYes, it's actually statistically safer to fly economy than first-class.[1] Save money and stay safer.",
                "Read the safety card and listen to the pre-flight safety speech. Yes, you may have heard it all before, and you’ll probably never need it, but if you keep your headphones on during the pre-flight instructions or ignore the safety card, you’ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash.\n\n\nDon’t assume you know it all already, either. Every type of airplane has different safety instructions.[2]\n\nIf you're sitting in an exit row, study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to. In normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door, but if they are dead or injured, you'll need to do it.",
                "Count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row. Find the exit closest to you, and count the number of seats that it'll take to get to it. If the plane crashes, it could be smoky, loud, or confusing in the cabin afterward. If you need to escape, you might have to feel your way to the exit, which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far.\n\n\nYou might even write down the number in pen on your hand, so you'll have a quick reference if you need to.",
                "Keep your seat belt on at all times. Every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the G-Force you'll experience in the crash, so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you're on the aircraft.\n\n\nPush the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible. You should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt, which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach.\nLeave your belt on, even if you're sleeping. If something happens while you're out, you'll be glad to have the restraints in place.",
                "Assess the situation. Try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations. If you’re going to be landing in water, for example, you’ll want to put your life vest on, though you need to wait to inflate it until you’re out of the plane. If you’re going to be landing in cold weather, you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside.\n\n\nPlot out the general course you'll be on ahead of time, so you'll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes. If you're flying from Iowa to California, you can be fairly certain you won't be landing in the ocean.\nUse the time before the crash to find your exit. If the plane is going to crash, you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact. Use this time to once again review where the exits are.",
                "Prepare your space as much as possible. If you know you’re going to crash, return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous, if at all possible. Zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet. Then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm.\n\n\nIn either position, your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs, which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact. Place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones.",
                "Brace yourself against the seat in front of you. If the seat in front of you is close enough to reach, place one hand palm-down on the back of that seat, then cross the other hand palm-down over the first hand. Rest your forehead against your hands. Keep your fingers unlaced.\n\n\nIt's also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head, tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it.[3]\n\nBend forward, if there's no seat in front of you. If you don’t have a seat close in front of you, bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees. Cross your wrists in front of your lower calves, and grab your ankles.",
                "Try and remain calm. It can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash. Keep a cool head, though, and you’re more likely to get out alive. Remember that even in the worst wrecks, you do have a chance of survival. You’ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance.",
                "In the case of a crash in water, put on your life jacket but do not inflate it. If you inflate it in the plane, when it starts to fill up with water, the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down, leaving you trapped. Instead, hold your breath and swim out, once you're out, inflate it.",
                "Put your oxygen mask on before assisting others. You’ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you’ve been on, but it’s worth repeating. If the integrity of the cabin is compromised, you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious.\n\n\nWhile you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you, you’ll be no good to anyone if you don’t remain conscious. Also, remember that you can put somebody else's oxygen mask on even if they're unconscious. This might help save their life.",
                "Protect yourself from smoke. Fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities. The smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic, so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in. If possible, moisten the cloth to provide extra protection.\n\n\nStay low as you escape, to duck under the level of smoke. It might not seem like a big deal, but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period.",
                "Get out of the airplane as quickly as possible. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post-crash fire, not injuries sustained in the crash itself.[4] It’s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay. If fire or smoke is present, you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane.\n\n\nMake sure the exit you choose is safe. Look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit. If there is, try the exit across the plane, or proceed to another set of exits.",
                "Listen to the flight attendants’ post-crash instructions. Flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash. If a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you, listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone’s chances of survival.",
                "Ditch your stuff. Don’t try to rescue your belongings. It’s common sense, but still some people don’t seem to get it. Leave everything behind. Rescuing your belongings will only slow you down.\n\n\nIf you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site, worry about that later. Right now, you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover. Get out now.",
                "Get at least 500 feet (152.4 m) upwind from the wreckage. If you’re stranded in a remote area, the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers. You don’t want to be too close, though. Fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash, so put some distance between you and the plane. If the crash is in open-water, swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible.",
                "Stay in one place, but pay attention to what needs to happen. While it’s essential to stay calm after a crash, you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly. Help out people who are struggling and tend to people's wounds using basic first aid available.\n\n\nAttend to your own wounds if at all possible. Check yourself for cuts and other abrasions, and apply pressure if necessary. Stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries.\nNegative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation. For example, a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit. Watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions.",
                "Wait for rescue. You stand a much higher chance of surviving if you just stay put. Don't wander off and look for help, or try to find something close by. If your plane went down, there will be people on the way quickly, and you want to be there when they arrive. Just stay put."

        "wikiHow to Get a Good Tan when You Are Light Skinned": {
            "intro": "Every fair-skinned person knows just how difficult getting a tan can be. Light skin is more susceptible to the sun's damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays, causing it to burn much faster than darker skin. Not only is this damage painful and unsightly, but it can also lead to long-term health problems like skin cancer.[1] Luckily, there are still many ways for fair-skinned people to achieve a great tan for the summer.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider possible health risks. While doctors generally recommend sunless tanning as a safer alternative to UV exposure, these products are not without drawbacks. The active ingredient in most sunless tanners is called dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA interacts with amino acids in your skin's outer layer to cause a browning effect. Some scientists have shown DHA to cause DNA damage at high concentrations.[2] However, DHA is safe to use on skin where it is mostly absorbed by dead cells. Minimize your risks by avoiding spray-on products that may be inhaled and rinsing off excess tanner from your hands. Additionally, some individuals are allergic to this chemical, which can result in contact dermatitis.[3]",
                "Pick the right sunless tanner. For pale skin, buy the lightest shade of self-tanner your product of choice comes in. Darker tanners contain higher concentrations of DHA. A too-dark sunless tan will look orange and unnatural on a person with naturally light skin.",
                "Exfoliate your skin. Removing excess dead skin before applying sunless tanner will help the color to last longer. Scrub gently with a washcloth or loofah. Pat your skin dry with a towel.[4]",
                "Massage the self-tanner into your skin. Avoid areas near your eyes, nose, and mouth. There are two main ways you can avoid discoloring your palms:\n\nWear exam gloves during application.\nApply the tanner in sections (arms, legs, torso, face) and wash your hands between each section.[5]",
                "Allow the self-tanner to dry. Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. Wait at least six hours before bathing or swimming. Re-apply the tanner daily until your skin reaches your desired hue.[6]",
                "Minimize sun exposure for 24 hours after using a product with DHA. If you must be in the sun, wear sunscreen. While DHA provides transient UV protection, it may also temporarily boost the production of UV-induced reactive oxygen species. These molecules are a major contributor to sun damage, negatively impacting your skin's health and appearance.[7][8]",
                "Massage sunscreen into all exposed skin 30 minutes before going outside. Buy a sunscreen that offers \"broad-spectrum\" protection, which will guard against both UVA and UVB rays. Dermatologists recommend a minimum SPF of 15, but individuals with very fair skin will likely need one with a higher rating.[9]",
                "Reapply sunscreen as necessary. Most sunscreen manufacturers advise to reapply every 2 to 3 hours. However, earlier reapplication is often necessary, especially for people with fair skin. Apply more sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes after any activities that may remove the sunscreen from your skin, such as sweating, swimming, or toweling off.[10]",
                "Tan in multiple short sessions over many days, weeks, or even months. Start out sunning yourself for only about 15 minutes each day. After about a week, work your way up to a maximum of 30 minutes. Stop sessions sooner than planned if you start to burn. While many think that longer, more intense tanning sessions are the quickest way to a great tan, this is not generally true, especially for fair-skinned people. The optimal amount of time in the sun to stimulate melanin production without damaging your skin is only about 30 minutes.[11]",
                "Avoid tanning when the sun is at its brightest. Damaging UV rays are at their peak between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm. Instead, tan in the early morning or late afternoon. If you must tan at peak hours, be sure to wear a sunscreen with a high SPF.[12]",
                "Wear a hat and sunglasses. A wide-brimmed hat will protect your sensitive scalp while letting some diffuse light in to tan your face. Sunglasses will protect your eyes from sun damage, which can lead to cataracts and other vision problems. Don't fall asleep with either on to avoid embarrassing tan (or burn) lines.[13]",
                "Protect your lips with SPF lip balm. Your lips can burn just as easily as the rest of your skin. The sun can also dry them out quickly, leading the painful chapped lips. SPF lip balms offer protection against both types of damage.[14]",
                "Remember that there is no completely safe way to sun tan. Even cautious tanning may lead to health problems down the line. Dermatologists assert that any UV-induced changes to your natural skin tone indicate damage. Be sure to weigh the cosmetic benefits against long-term health risks.[15]",
                "Keep in mind any medications you are taking. Certain medications, such as retinoids and some antibiotics, can dramatically increase your skin's susceptibility to sun damage. Before you tan, carefully read all warning labels and literature for your medications, vitamins, and health supplements. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.[16]\n\nIf you are taking any unprescribed dietary supplements or herbal medicines, it is very important to do your own independent research. The FDA regulates this class of products much more loosely than conventional drugs. Warning labels are not required, and supplements may actually contain ingredients with different concentrations and even identities than those advertised.[17]",
                "Steer clear of tanning beds. Indoor tanning uses high-intensity UV rays that are often too much, especially for fair skin. Although tanning beds are marketed as a safe alternative to natural sunlight, they actually represent a number of added health risks:\n\n\nPremature aging of the skin.\nBlinding eye diseases.[18]\n\nInfectious diseases, such as herpes and warts, from improperly-cleaned equipment.",
                "Refrain from tanning pills. There are no currently FDA-approved pills for enhancing your skin's color. Tanning pills typically contain the pigment canthaxanthin and are illegal to import and sell within the United States. When ingested in large amounts, this substance commonly causes damage to the eyes, skin, and digestive system. [19]"

        "How to Play Apples to Apples": {
            "intro": "Apples To Apples is a card game that is appropriate for all ages and is a blast to play in groups. Players have to match red object cards with green descriptive cards, and whoever comes up with the strongest or most amusing pairing wins. You can learn the rules of Apples To Apples in no time at all: simply deal the deck, pick a judge and let the fun begin!",
            "steps": [
                "Decide how many players there will be. Get together a group of your friends to play the game. Players should gather around a table or arrange themselves in a circle on the floor. Apples To Apples works best with 4-10 players, but some versions can be played with more. The fewer players there are, the faster paced the game will be, which can increase the hilarity.[1]\n\nA deluxe “Party” version of Apples To Apples can be played by 12 or more people.[2]",
                "Shuffle the two decks of cards. Start by thoroughly shuffling both the red and green decks of cards to make sure that they are drawn in random order. Cards from each deck will be used during every individual round of play. Keep the decks separated—red cards should never be mixed with green cards within a deck.[3]\n\nAlways make sure to shuffle after the conclusion of a game so that the same cards aren’t dealt and played in the next game.",
                "Pick a judge for the first round. Decide among your friends who will serve as the judge for the first round of gameplay. The judge is responsible for deciding who has the best match, and therefore who wins each round. Each player has a chance to be the judge, as the position is handed off to the player on the left after each consecutive round.[4]\n\nJudges may pick the winning red card for any reason. One judge might choose the strongest direct match, such as a red card reading “Scissors” for a green card reading “Sharp,” while another will favor ironic or humorous associations. These types of differences are what makes the game exciting!\nEveryone will take multiple turns as the judge, so it doesn’t much matter who starts the game off.",
                "Deal seven red cards to each player. The judge will also act as the dealer. Whoever your group chooses to be the judge of the first round will deal seven red cards to each player around the table. You will replenish your red cards after every round, meaning that each player should always have seven red cards at the start of a new round. When each player has seven red cards in their hand, the game is ready to begin.[5]\n\nKeep an eye on your red cards to make sure you have seven at at all times. Otherwise, you may be limiting your playable options.",
                "Turn over the top green card. The judge should flip over the card at the top of the green deck and call it out to the group. Green cards bear descriptive terms that must be matched by the people, objects, places or events on the players’ red cards. The green card in play might read “Cute,” “Harmful” or “Patriotic.” These terms are designed to describe the red cards laid down by players each round.[6]\n\nThere are over 749 red cards and nearly 249 green cards in the basic version of the game. That’s enough different matches for hours and hours of fun.",
                "Lay down a red card to match the green card. Players will now select one of their seven red cards to associate with the word on the green card. For example, a player might play a red card reading “Babies” to match a green card reading “Cute.” There are nearly endless possible combinations of red and green cards, so get creative![7]\n\nEach player should choose a red card to play quickly to keep the game moving at a brisk pace. Cards should be played face down beside the green card.\nThe judge is the only player who will not lay down a red card. The judge changes every round, giving everyone an equal chance to play.",
                "Mix up the stack of cards. After every player has laid down a red card, the judge should shuffle or mix up the stack of red cards in play. This will ensure that the judge doesn’t know who played each card. The cards should be left face down as they are rearranged.[8]\n\nThere’s no need to shuffle extensively. Just reorganize the red cards until they’re out of the order in which they were laid down.",
                "Decide who has the best match. Now the judge will turn over and look at each card. Whichever card the judge decides is the best match for the green card wins. The winning player will identify themselves and collect the green card from the round. The player to the left of the first round judge will become the new judge, players will take one card from the red deck to replenish their hand and the game will continue.[9]\n\nThe number of green cards accumulated by the end of the game determines the winner. The official Apples To Apples rule guide suggests 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 green cards be the winning number for games with 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 players, respectively.[10]\n\nAfter the round-winning card is chosen, all red cards that have been played should be returned to the bottom of the red deck.",
                "Choose a winning number of green cards. The game’s official rules recommend that players compete for a certain number of green cards in order to win. However, you can modify this number as you see fit. For instance, you might play for 10 green cards to keep the game going longer, or take a “sudden death” approach and see who can win 3 cards the fastest. The options are totally customizable, depending only on the number of players in your group and how you’d like the game to proceed.[11]\n\nYou might also elect for players to replace their red cards with green cards for a winning outcome. For this to work, a player will add the green cards they’ve won to their deck after each round, meaning they’ll have fewer red cards to choose from. Once a player reaches seven green cards in their deck, they are declared the winner.",
                "Match opposites in the “Crab Apple” version. Rather than finding the strongest match for each card, switch gears and play the “Crab Apple” version of the game. This requires players to play red cards that are the opposite of the green card in play. If the green card reads “Scary,” players might try to win the round with cards like “Kitten” or “Love.” Choose carefully—coming up with the right combination of cards might be trickier than you expect![12][13]\n\nPlaying Crab Apple effectively doubles the number of possible card associations.\nVariant versions of Apples To Apples force you to think more carefully about your card choices, breaking up the monotony of the standard games.",
                "Play “Apple Potpourri.” For a more challenging and hilarious experience, try playing “Apple Potpourri.” This is when players choose a red card to play before the green card is revealed. The judge chooses the best match as usual, but the player gives up control over their card associations and the outcomes are random. Apple Potpourri can be especially fun in large groups, as there will be more options for the judge to choose from.[14][15]\n\nApple Potpourri is a perfect alternative for groups where the judges tend to choose the most entertaining card combinations.",
                "Try “2-For-1 Apples.” To up the stakes of the game and keep things interesting, make each round count double. The judge will turn over two green cards instead of just one, and players will have to choose a red card that is best described by both of the terms on the green cards. This variation of the game forces players to think more carefully about each pay, as red cards has to be associated with two different terms, and rounds are worth two green cards.[16][17]\n\nFor the 2-For-1 Apples version of the game, you can decide whether the same number of cards is necessary to win, resulting in a quicker paced game, or whether to also double the number of green cards needed and only increase the difficulty of each round."

        "How to Start Jogging": {
            "intro": "The benefits of regular exercise are by now well known and well documented, and running for 30-40 minutes three times a week can be a fantastic way to build stamina and muscle while losing fat.[1] That all sounds great, but how do you get started if you’re new to running? Read on to find out.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine what you’ll need from your running shoes. Running requires very little equipment, but the one requirement it does have--good, supportive shoes--is crucial. Running exerts three- to five-times your body’s weight of pressure on your joints and muscles, which adds up to quite a bit of stress on your lower body.[2]\n\nThe two major factors you need to take into consideration when figuring out your shoe needs are cushioning and support.\nThe larger your body frame, the more cushioning you’ll need. You can also factor in your particular preferences here: if you like a cushion-like feel, look for more cushion, while if you prefer closer-to-the ground sensation, opt for less.[3]\n\nThe amount of support you’ll need will depend on the height of your arch and how flexible your feet are. If you have a high arch, your feet are likely less flexible and so require a lesser level of support, while if you have a low arch, you’ll need a higher level of support.",
                "Invest in good running shoes. Once you have a sense of what you need from a running shoe, it’s time to go out and invest in a quality pair.\n\n\nRunning with the wrong shoes (ie, any kind of shoe not made for running or a worn-out pair of running shoes) is the fastest way to develop an injury and sideline yourself. Running with the right shoes, on the other hand, can help your form, help prevent injury, and extend your running stamina.\nGo to your local running store to get a pair of shoes custom fitted to you. Running shoes require a small initial outlay that can run anywhere from $60 to over $100, so if you plan to start jogging, figure the cost of shoes into your plan.\nA number of shoe retailers and brand websites offer shoe finders that will help you pinpoint the right kind of shoe for your needs. But because you may not exactly know your needs, particularly if you’re just starting out, these can be a less-than-precise tool. Your best option is to go in person to a running store where employees can watch your stride and guide you to the best shoe.\nDon’t get taken in by new and innovative “extras.” You don’t need any elaborate bells and whistles, just a shoe that offers the right amount of cushioning and support for your needs.[4]\n\nBecause running shoes are functional, always go for form over fashion. Yes, some running shoes come in an appetizing array of rainbow day-glo colors, but remember that ultimately your shoes need to protect your joints and muscles, not dazzle them.\nBe sure to give shoes a test run before committing. This is another reason going to your local running store is ideal--it will allow you to jog around in your shoes before committing to them. If you buy your shoes online, be sure to buy from a site that will let you easily return or exchange them if needed. Be sure to wear the same socks you plan to run in when testing out shoes.[5]\n\nYou’ll know you have the rights shoes for you when you don’t experience discomfort during or after the run. If your shoes give you blisters, cause chafing, or make your feet sore, you need to either have the fit adjusted or replace the shoes.\nYou should replace your running shoes after about 350-500 miles (560-800 kilometers), when you see any part of the shoe beginning to wear out, or if the shoes begin causing you pain.[6]",
                "Decide where you’ll do your workout. The two major options for runners are of course outdoor running or indoor running on an indoor track or on a treadmill.\n\n\nTake into account the weather where you live, the time of day you’ll be exercising, the kinds of surfaces available for you to run on, and the safety of areas where you’ll be running.\nIf you live somewhere with access to soft, level surfaces, like a college track or a well-tended grass playing field, you can consider those good outdoor jogging options.\nIn addition to offering a soft, level surface, an ideal outdoor running location should be well-lit and fairly popular with other exercisers.\nIf you don’t have access to a safe, well-lit area with a soft, level running surface, running on a treadmill may be more ideal.\nIf you plan to exercise very early or very late in the day, running indoors on a treadmill may be the safer option.\nFinally, if you live somewhere with extreme weather that may hinder your ability to run outdoors, your best option may be to explore running indoors.",
                "Walk. Before you dive into a running routine, begin by walking, particularly if you’re new to exercise or out of shape.[7]\n\nStart by walking for 15-20 minutes a day 3-4 times a week.\nGradually increase the pace of your walking until jogging becomes the next logical step.",
                "Stretch before each run. Keeping your muscles limber and flexible is vitally important to avoiding injury and overdue stress on your body. It’s crucial to warm up your muscles before you begin stretching to avoid strain and injury.[8]\n\nBefore stretching for your run, do a 5-10 minute warmup. Moving from top to bottom (or bottom to top), rotate your joints clockwise and counter-clockwise until they feel loose and easy.\nAfter warming up your joints, spend at least 5 minutes doing an aerobic activity that will raise your heart rate, like jumping rope.\nNext, begin stretching with slow and relaxed stretches. After doing a series of slow stretches, move on to more dynamic stretches like leg raises and arm swings.\nOnce your muscles feel loose and warm, begin your workout.\nAfter you finish your workout, spend 5-10 minutes cooling down with more dynamic stretches followed by more relaxed stretches. Doing so will improve strength and flexibility as well as help prevent soreness and muscle fatigue.",
                "Pace yourself. When you begin running, even if you’re in shape from another sport, you’re using new muscles and will have to adjust accordingly. So start off slow.\n\n\nOn your first few runs, it’s recommended that you run for 5 minutes, then walk for 2 minutes and switch off for the duration of your run. This will give you a good workout while also allowing your body to adjust.[9]",
                "Practice the right form. Though most people assume how far and how long you run has purely to do with endurance and determination, having the proper running form actually quite significantly impacts your performance.[10]\n\nAvoid heel-striking. When running, many people tend to overextend their leg when striding forward, resulting in an undue amount of heel striking, which is both bad for your form and for your lower body. When you land your front foot, your knee should be above your foot and your shin should be vertical.[11] Imagine how you would run if you had on no shoes at all--you would avoid striking your heel because it would hurt. So when you go running, run with the barefoot model in mind.[12]\n\nKeep your upper body relaxed. Consciously keep your jaw relaxed and your shoulders and avoid clenching your hands.\nHold your arms in a 90 degree position and keep them there--don’t let them fall out of position on the back-swing.\nLearn to “run tall.” To help you maintain the right posture, remind yourself to “run tall”--that is, hold your body as though someone were pulling you up by you hair, with a slight forward lean.[13] You want your hips and shoulders relaxed and level and your arms to the sides of your body. To help you get the sense of what the proper position feels like, interlock your hands and rest them on your head, then run. That’s the body position you want to maintain.[14]\n\nKeep your arms beside your body. Don’t allow your arms to cross over your body--it’s bad form and it wastes energy. Instead, imagine grabbing belt loops with your thumbs as you move your arms back and forth to help keep your arms parallel to your body.\nBreathe regularly. Keep an even rate of breathing while running and “breathe with your belly”--ie, take deep breaths into your stomach rather than shallow breaths into your chest. Try syncing your breathing with your steps as you run to help keep your breathing regular.[15]",
                "Set up a regular schedule. Having a regular schedule is key to maintaining an exercise routine. If you find the right time of day and duration and stick to it, you’re more likely to maintain a steady and regular exercise regimen.\n\n\nLook for a part of the day when you have enough time to devote to running without being stressed or rushed.\nConsider safety as well--if you’ll be running in the dark, wear bright colors and a light; if you’ll be running in an isolated area, do so during the day and always carry a cell phone or other emergency communication device, and consider carrying a can of mace or pepper spray with you for self defense.",
                "Let technology help you. There are a range of fitness apps out there that can do everything from track your average speed, distance, and calorie expenditure to turn your run into a game by putting you in the middle of a zombie-survival scenario.\n\n\nEventually, if you become a more serious runner, you can consider upgrading to dedicated running devices that track your vitals and progress in more detail.",
                "Gradually increase your time and distance. As you get into better shape, gradually increase your workouts to help prevent you from getting into an exercise rut.\n\n\nIncrease your run by about 10 percent per week. So, if you run 5 miles one week, increase it to 5.5 miles the next.[16]",
                "Vary your routine. Changing up your running routine is important to keep your body challenged so it doesn’t fall into a fitness rut. Variation is also vital to keeping you from getting bored or discouraged with your routine.[17]\n\nIntegrating new terrain can help change up your routine, so try adding hills or stairs to your route.\nInclude intervals in your run. Intervals involve repeatedly alternating between running full out for several seconds followed by returning to a normal pace for several minutes.\nAlternatively, you can choose a landmark, sprint to it, then return to your normal pace for several minutes before choosing another landmark, sprinting to it, returning to normal pace, and so on.[18]\n\nTry running a longer distance at a slower pace. Doing so will vary the kinds of muscles and muscle strength needed to complete your run, which will not only help keep you in physical shape but help keep you from getting bored or complacent in your routine.[19]",
                "Get a running buddy. Running with another person is a great way to stay motivated and to hold yourself accountable.\n\n\nIf you don’t have any friends willing to join you, look up running-community sites online. Many of them offer services to help connect people looking for a running buddy or looking to join a running group.[20]"

Grape, pineapple, watermelon, limeaide--it's up to you!\nYou may even want to try adding some veggie juice--carrot juice is naturally very sweet and can add a nice complexity to your lollies.[2]",
                "Pour mixture into a clean, empty ice cube tray. Fill each cell almost to the top, but don't overflow or your lollies will stick together.",
                "Cover the tray with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Make sure the wrap is tight across the top of the tray.[3]\n\nTape plastic wrap to the sides of the ice tray to keep it tight and in place.",

                "Hull the strawberries. It's best to let an adult do this, since it requires you to use a knife.

Try watermelon, mango, blueberry--whatever you like best! Look for fruit that is ripe and in season for the best, sweetest flavors.[13]\n\nTry coconut milk instead of heavy cream for a refreshing tropical flavor.\nYou can also improvise with your sweetener. Instead of simple syrup, try agave nectar, honey, or maple syrup.",

                "Pour the sweetened kiwi mixture into the ice lolly mold. Don't let the kiwi spill out of the top of the mold, or your lollies will all freeze together. Leave a little room at the top so you can insert the handle and give the puree a little room to expand as it freezes.",
                "Top the mold with the lid. Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. You may have to push it into the already frozen part of the lollie.\n\n\nIf your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil.\nInsert a popsicle stick through the aluminum foil. Make sure it is straight. It's okay if you have to push it into the frozen peach layer to make sure it's secure.",
                "Put the mold in the freezer for another 2 hours, or until the kiwi mixture is frozen.\n\n\nTest that the juice is completely frozen by wiggling the handle of one of the pops. It should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom mold to help release ice lollies in one piece--just don't loosen them from the handle![30]",
                "Your finished ice lollies should be equal layers of pink, yellow, and green--just like a traffic light! After you've enjoyed these frozen treats, consider experimenting with other flavors. Try to stick with fruits that are all in season at the same time for the most harmonious flavors.[31]\n\nSpring and summer fruits include blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries, grapes, melons, nectarines, plums, peaches, and pluots.[32]\n\nBlackberries, apples, kiwis, dates, kumquats, peaches, pomegranates, and raspberries are all in season during late summer and fall.[33]\n\nTry grapefruit, kumquats, limes, mandarins, and pomelos in the winter.[34]\n\nOranges are in season all year long.[35]"

        "wikiHow to Make a Candle Powered Boat": {
            "intro": "A candle powered boat is a toy originating from France in 1891[1]. Other names for a candle powered boat include Can-Can-boot, Knatterboot, toc-toc, Puf-Puf boat, Poof Poof craft, Phut-Phut, or Pouet-Pouet (because of the sound they make). A candle powered boat runs using a very simple heat engine. This small boiler, is connected to an exhaust tube (in this case straws). When heat is applied to the boiler (by the candle), water in the boiler flashes into steam. The expanding steam[2] pushes some of the water in the exhaust tube, moving the boat forward. The steam bubble then condenses, creating a vacuum which draws water back in through the exhaust tube. The cooled water that is brought back into the boiler is then heated and flashed into steam, and the cycle repeats. This constant flashing and cooling cycle of the engine creates the distinctive \"pop pop\" noise for which the boat is sometimes called.[3]",

                "Take your soda can. Take off the cap and wash it. Cut the bottom, and along the sides. This will create a flat sheet. It is okay if the sides are somewhat jagged, as you will trim it later. Once you have the flat sheet, roll it backwards along the table to undo the curve the can naturally has.",
                "Cut a straight line along one edge, and mark a 6cm x 18cm rectangle. Cut that rectangle out and trim any jagged edges still there. Be very careful not to cut yourself. Recycle the other pieces.",
                "Gently fold the aluminum sheet in half, being careful not to tear it by pressing too hard. If it helps, fold it along a ruler. Unfold after you've done this.",
                "On one half of the aluminum sheet, mark out three lines 1 cm from the edges. Cut along these lines and trim the pieces that hand off. You should have one half being 6cm x 9cm and the other being 4cm x 8cm.",
                "Take the Blu-Tac, warm it up in your hands and roll it into a long snake about 0.5cm in diameter. Line two edges of the smaller edge with this Blu-Tac, then flatten it out slightly.",
                "Fold it in half again, remembering not to press too hard. Press the Blu-Tac under the metal. Next, line the top of the piece you just folded over with more Blu-Tac, directly over the other bead of Blu-Tac.",
                "Fold the edges over where the Blu-Tac you just applied and crimp the metal with pliers. Be gentle, making sure to not tear the metal. If possible, use small pliers.",
                "Remove the excess metal to leave one long tab along the bottom. It is not very important for the edge to be perfectly straight, but it helps a lot if it is. It should now be approximately 9cm long and 4cm wide.",
                "Take the Blu-Tac and flatten it out into a strip about 1cm wide. If necessary, fold it in half then flatten it.",
                "Take the Blu-Tac and wrap it around the first straw, followed by the second. Wrap the first one so it is completely covered twice, then add the second straw, continuing to wrap the Blu-Tac around both straws until the Blu-Tac is used up. Make sure to add enough Blu-Tac so that the straws are well-secured by a good plug of Blu-Tac.",
                "Open up the pocket of the boiler and carefully insert the straw plug. Add some more Blu-Tac until it forms a good seal. Remember the Goldilocks principle: not too much, not too little.",
                "Cut along the tab at the end near the straws. Fold the two outer pieces up, and squeeze them with the pliers. Add any needed Blu-Tac.",
                "The boiler is now complete.\n\n\nTest that it is airtight by putting it underwater and blowing. If you see any bubbles, give that area a gentle squeeze with the pliers and try again.",
                "Cut an empty carton in half from top to bottom. Leave the top closed when you do this. If it opens using the carton itself, use the end that is not open. If it uses a bottle top, use the side without the bottle top.",
                "Take the other half of the carton and cut off the spout/top off of it. Cut out any Windows, and decorate it as you see fit. Put aside the cabin to attach later with glue, tape or Blu-Tac, attach the 'cabin' to the boat.",
                "Cut a small hole big enough to hold the two straws, but no bigger. It may be easier to cut this part with a knife. If desired, twist the knife around in the hole to scrape the edges so they are smooth.",
                "The boat is now finished.",
                "Stick the straws through the hole and tape the long part to the bottom. Snip off any extra that extends past the end of the boat.",
                "Plug up the hole with Blu-Tac. Once you have successfully taped the straws to the bottom, cover the hole on both sides with Blu-Tac. Quickly test the boat to see if it's watertight. If not, add more Blu-Tac.",
                "Stick on the cabin. Attach it with glue, tape or Blu-Tac. Your boat and cabin are now complete.",
                "Prep the boat by taking one straw and, with water in your mouth, blowing hard until water comes out of the other straw. You can also do it by sucking water into your mouth. Once prepped, tape the straw back to the boat.",
                "Place the candle in the boat. After a few moments, the boat will being to move forward in the water and make its signature popping sound.",

        "wikiHow to Get an Aries Man": {
            "intro": "If you want to get an Aries man (March 21 - April 19) you will need to be bold, sophisticated and savvy. Catching his eye will be all about working what you’ve got and having the confidence to reel him in. It's no wonder you've fallen for this guy -- he's confident, charming, and sexy as hell. Work your magic from that first glance to forming a lasting relationship!",
            "steps": [
                "Flirt. First things first, Aries is a fiery, passionate, sexual sign. If your lustful, impulsive side is at all buried under a pile of inhibitions or insecurities, your Aries will quickly look the other way. So get to flirting and constantly -- it's a primary source of fun and reaffirmation for this sign of the zodiac. In their minds, it keeps every situation spicy!\n\n\nFlirt with him on every level -- with your body, with your eyes, and with your words. To make him even more entertained, make it subtle with double entendres and plays on words. The Aries man loves a clever woman who can keep him thinking on his toes.",
                "Use body language. Aries men are very tuned into their bodies and how others operate in theirs. To satisfy this need of his, use your body language to draw him in. As you pass him, graze his back. Tousle his hair at the nape of his neck. Dangle a heel against his calf. He loves the challenge of not being able to think straight!\n\n\nThis being said, Aries men do love an intellectual woman. They're all about passion, novelty, and excitement. If you can keep them engaged on multiple levels (intellectually, sensually, etc.) they'll be even more amazed and in awe of you.",
                "Dress femininely. Most Aries men are attracted to women who are quite feminine. They want to be with a woman who they can provide for, who they can feel needs them like a damsel in distress. Crazily enough, clothes can convey this meaning. Dresses and skirts can remind him of your femininity and still be classy!\n\n\nSince your Aries is so sensual, it's important to smell great, too. You want to engage all his senses. Soft skin to touch, a luscious scent to smell, a feminine silhouette to gaze upon, etc. You want to keep his mind reeling 24/7.",
                "Admire him. Let's put it out there: the Aries man is pretty fond of himself. He can be rather self-centered and egotistical. In order to get into his head, you'll have to play along. Give him the praise he believes he deserves. He'll think you're just showing good sense!\n\n\nThis can be a quality that's a little hard to come to terms with. Realize that it's just a part of his personality and how he operates. Some will find it charming; others will find it painful. If you can find it charming, he'll love you for it!",
                "Be confident. The Aries man needs a strong personality to counter his boundless enthusiasm and drive. Though he does crave a damsel in distress, he also needs a woman that's confident. Kinda seems like a contradiction in terms, but it is doable. Show him that you love who you are and he won't be able to argue with it. Who could?\n\n\nJust because you're praising him and being coquettish doesn't mean you can't be confident about it! On the contrary, doing these things shows him that you know what you're doing and are comfortable deferring to others.",
                "Be clever. In addition to confidence, Aries loves a woman who is clever. They want someone who can play at all levels -- the Aries man is not a fan of boredom (and that's putting it lightly). They need to be entertained. Being clever can do just that!\n\n\nGo ahead, tease your Aries! They'll love the attention, especially if you do it slyly and with a grin. Don't just spit out facts -- add humor and dynamism to your words. In short, be yourself!",
                "Know that he's a fire sign. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are all what are called \"fire\" signs. This means just what it sounds like -- they are enthusiastic, larger than life, and unstoppable. They are generally very self-assured, confident, sexual and incredibly creative. Your Aries is just that!\n\n\nThe downside of this is that they have very strong personalities and can be seen as rather bossy. When a fire sign gets too hot to touch, you may need to stand back to avoid \"getting burnt.\" If you can handle the heat, stay in the kitchen!",
                "Play a savvy game of cat and mouse. Let your Aries man always think that he is the pursuer and you are his lovely catch. He sits naturally in the role and loves nothing more than an old fashioned chase. So don’t make it easy for him and enjoy the attention he pores on you as he slowly circles you and draws you in. This is the best position for you to be in to get an Aries man.\n\n\nTake pleasure in knowing that you are actually dictating the moves while he is none the wiser. But don't be the mouse that runs away and can't be seen anymore -- stay just out of his reach. Let him think he's making progress and about to get you. If he doesn't see progress happening, he'll find another mouse to play with.",
                "Engage him in debate. Aries loves a woman who can challenge him mentally. Don't be afraid to start an intellectual debate with him to get his brain juices running. He should be in awe of you just as much as you're in awe of him!\n\n\n\nHowever, be careful with this. He likes being on top. If you prove him wrong, he may get emasculated and not be able to handle it. Give concessions. Agree to disagree or tell him that he's made valid points that are getting you thinking. He really likes debating -- he also really likes winning.",
                "Get adventurous. There is no room for boredom in Aries' life. The second they get bored, they go elsewhere seeking fulfillment and excitement. So seek adventure yourself! Suggest dates that are exotic and a little crazier than your typical dinner and a movie. Go to an amusement park, go hiking, or go on an impromptu road trip. Keep it spicy!\n\n\nNot only is this good advice for Aries, but it's good advice for everyone. Ever heard of the Capilano Bridge Experiment? Turns out there's such a thing as a \"misattribution of arousal\" -- meaning that when your body gets aroused (be it from heights or horror, etc.), you don't know why -- and you attribute it to the sexiness of your partner![1]",
                "Take the good with the bad. Aries (fire signs in general, really) tend to have a few characteristics that others find off-putting: They can be selfish, jealous, temperamental, childish, and moody. When this side breaks out, it's important to stay calm and not take it too personally. If they're displaying emotion, it means they care!\n\n\nThat being said, Aries are full of great qualities, too (otherwise you wouldn't be attracted to them in the first place!) They are driven, confident, charismatic, clever, sensual creatures. Their less positive traits are just more obvious because their personalities are so strong.",
                "Keep him wanting more. Aries loves the thrill of the chase so much it can seem hard to keep them running after you for more than a hot minute. But it is possible if done with a bit of panache. Don't give your entire personality up at the get-go. Leave little gems for them to discover along the way to keep them thinking there's more of you to conquer!\n\n\nBecause of this, it's important that you maintain your own self in this relationship. Keep up your hobbies, have a world they're not a part of. That way Aries will feel like there's more territory they need to gain, a more thorough understanding they can have of you. They don't want their partner to be easily figured out!",
                "Be naughty and impulsive. Remember that \"Aries hate being bored,\" thing? Get around this by being a little naughty and impulsive. They are too, so when you show this side, they'll get it. Suggest an impromptu romp and refer to it as a \"power lunch.\" They'll be left reeling for days.\n\n\nIn addition to impulsive sexual behavior, be impulsive with your lifestyle! Surprise gifts, surprise trips, spur-of-the-moment changes in plans -- Aries will eat it up. They'll spend every day wondering what the next will have in store. And looking forward to it!",
                "Notice the details. When you're springing surprise romantic gestures on your man, make it clear you've been paying attention. He'll love seeing that you remember that one comment on Star Wars he made three months ago. That's admiration in its finest form! The little things mean a ton to him.\n\n\nThis goes back to Aries needing praise and attention. Even if he seems self-assured and like he needs nothing, it's not true. He still needs others, craving their approval and notice. These little displays of your awesome observational skills will let him know you're there and giving him just what he needs.",
                "Don't get too clingy. Aries is a fire sign and needs to be let loose to find his true power. If you try to reign him in, he'll just explode. He relishes his independence and thrives on it, so it's important not to be too clingy. Let him do his thing. Trust him.\n\n\nAries wants a partner that is their own spirit. When you start attaching onto his, you're cramping his style. Be confident in your relationship! It's the sexiest thing there is.",
                "Be energetic and enthusiastic. Aries is full of life and he expects you to be too. How else could you keep up with his vitality?! He's going, going, going, so to be a viable partner, you'll need to be quite the Energizer bunny yourself. So when it comes to life, get excited! It's the only one you have, after all.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to show your emotions. Aries thrives off of stimuli and sensation. If something makes you excited, preach it on the hilltops! And if your Aries is showing you how much he cares, definitely give him the reaction he's aiming for!",
                "Let him be your knight in shining armor. At the end of the day, Mr. Ram is looking to provide for you and to be the man you've dreamed of. He feels he's worthy of it, so let him! He can be all about chivalry -- which is nice, considering it's practically dead. Let him keep it alive. Let him know he's needed. How could he then stray?\n\n\nAllow yourself to get vulnerable with him. Though he can be erratic and moody and fiercely independent, showing him you can get real will show him he, in turn, can get real too. He'll love seeing the softer, genuine side of you. And he'll love that you trust him enough to do so!"

            "intro": "Some dogs are naturally more playful than others. Additionally, some breeds are also generally more sociable than other dog breeds. If you’re dog seems bored, lonely, or unhappy, there are many ways you can try to address their malaise. In order to make your dog more playful, it’s important to play with your dog regularly, bond with your dog, and pay attention to your dog’s needs. Making your dog more playful will make both you and your pet happier in your relationship.",
            "steps": [
                "Play fetch or other retrieving exercises with your dog. Dogs like to chase and retrieve items, including bones and balls. If you can, try to train your dog to come to you before you throw the item and then bring it back to you once they retrieve it.[1]\n\nSay “come” and get your dog to approach you. Get your dog to sit by putting the ball on their forehead and stating “sit”\nWhen you throw the ball, tell your dog to “get it”. After they retrieve it, tell them “bring it here” to have them take it back to you to throw again.",
                "Get dog toys for a variety of activities. Show off the toy to your dog, but don’t play with it immediately. Try tug toys or braided rope toys that you can play back and forth with them. You can also try teething or training toys that can strengthen your dog’s teeth.[2]\n\nTalk excitedly to your dog about the toy by saying things like “Where is it?” in reference to the dog toy. If your dog wants to play, they should begin wagging their tale and get excited.\nWhen you take out the dog toy, play with it first before you start playing with the dog. Use the toy to play with the dog for a brief amount of time before they get tired with it. This will help build their excitement for the next time you break out the dog toys.",
                "Play hunting and hiding games with your dog. Dogs like finding people and objects that are hidden. These types of games can stimulate your dog’s mind and their senses.[3]\n\nWhile your dog is in the other room, hide in another room. Call them to come and find you. When they do, give them treats and dog toys to reward them.\nYou can also hide doggie treats somewhere in the yard or in a room. When your dog comes into the room, they should sniff around in search of the treat. Give them encouragement when they get closer or farther away from finding the treat.",
                "Invite other dogs over to play. Your dog might get happy when he's around other dogs. For many dogs, having some friendly play with their fellow canines can be engaging and exciting.\n\n\nYour dog may like to roughhouse, but make sure things do not get out of hand. When they are play fighting, dogs will often avoid really biting the other dog and roll over often.[4]\n\nIf your dog is growling when playing with other dogs, their play fighting may have escalated into real fighting. You can also tell if they begin baring their teeth while wrestling with the other dog.[5]",
                "Teach your dog tricks. Dog tricks can be fun, but also very useful. While there are many different tricks you can teach your dog, a few essential tricks can really show off your dog’s ability and make them more playful.[6]\n\nRollover is one easy trick to teach your dog. When your dog is lying down, move a food lure across its muzzle, neck, and shoulders. Use the command “Roll over” while doing so to get them to associate your command with the action.\nStay can also be a very useful command. Ask your dog to sit in front of you while holding a treat and maintaining eye contact. If they are able to stay still, reward them with the treat and add the command “Stay” so they know what to do when you state the command.\nA “Go to” command can be useful in directing your dog. With a treat, walk to a whichever place you want them to go and place the treat there. Eventually, they will associate the place with the treat and with your specific “Go to” command.",
                "Take your dog to a dog park. Dog parks can a fun place for your dog to play with other dogs. It’s important for your dog to be able to play well with other dogs, so they don’t get into any fights with other dogs.[7]\n\nAfter you’ve walked around the park with the dog to make sure it’s safe, you can take off their leash so they can run around. You’ll want to know where your dog is at all times, but not having a leash gives them greater freedom to roam around the park.\nIf you have a small dog, try to bring them specifically to a section of the park with other small dogs. Otherwise, they may get overwhelmed.",
                "Show physical affection to your dog. Dogs like physical affection, and it can bond them closer to their owners. Spend time petting or grooming your dog nearly every day.\n\n\nDogs can be sensitive to touch at first. Touching them each day can build up their sensitivity and get them to crave your touch.[8]\n\nYou can also groom them on a regular basis. Just something as simple as brushing their coat with a brush can show your dog physical affection.",
                "Spend one-on-one time with your dog every day. Even if you're at work all day, it's good to have some time alone with your dog. Taking your dog for a walk every day can be a good way to reaffirm your bond with your dog.[9]\n\nIf you go on a walk with your dog, make it an engaging activity for your dog. Instead of walking aimlessly, try to give your dog specific goals and landmarks to walk or run to that you can do together.\nTalk to your dog or teach them a trick. If you try a new trick every few weeks, this will bond you and your dog together and keep them focused on doing well for you.",
                "Do focused activities with your dog. Dogs like to have structure, since it gives them a clear sense of purpose. When you play with your dog, try to make them task-oriented.\n\n\nGive them directions on where to run, jump, and play. Playing catch is a good example of directed play.\nDogs also like to please their owners. Focused activities can tell your dog that they have fulfilled your expectations and you're happy with them.",
                "Give praise to your dog. When you are training your dog, it’s especially good to give positive reinforcement. Additionally, praising your dog can make you grow closer together.[10]\n\nWhile treats may be the most common type of positive reinforcement, it’s also important to speak to your dog positively. They will associate your tone of voice with your mood and feel happy as well.\nIf your dog does not respond to treats, a toy may also be a good way to praise your dog. They may also like physical affection from you, such as being petted, as a method of praise.",
                "Start obedience training. Dogs like to be trained, since they like structure. You can either have your dog join a class or do it just with you. In either case, you should be heavily involved in any training with your dog.[11]\n\nIf you are training your dog, always use positive reinforcement. Dogs like treats and voice training (like \"Good boy\") that tell them they are doing well.\nPay attention to your dog's mood. They need to be in the right mood for training. Otherwise, it will not be an effective training session and will be frustrated with you and your dog.[12]",
                "Take your dog to a training or activity class. If you're working a specific skill or behavior, a training or activity class can be fun for you to do with your dog. These classes can be good for you and your dog to use to bond over a shared activity.[13]\n\nActivity classes can work from puppies to adult dogs. For puppies, these activity classes may be especially useful to teach them discipline and some general training.\nIf you have a new dog that's not a puppy, it may be a good idea to bring them to a training class. Even if they are trained, you and your dog could use the class to learn how to work together.",
                "Know your dog's likes and dislikes. Since not all dogs are the same, every dog has different things they like and don't like. Paying attention to things like their favorite and least favorite things let them know you care.[14]\n\nYour dog likely has favorite foods, toys, and games. Give them these things, so they will affiliated their favorites with you.\nStay away from things you know your dog dislikes. Some things that all dogs dislikes are head pats, hugging, floral smells, and loud noises.",
                "Read your dog's body language. Your dog gives you plenty of clues how they feel. Watch your dog during activities and you should be able to tell if they are enjoying them or not.\n\n\nWhen your dog is playful, they are performing a \"play bow\". In the play bow, their rear end is up and their front end is down.[15]\n\nDogs that are whining, pacing, or doing anything unusual are usually stressed or fearful. These activities show you that your dog is not ready to play and likely needs to calm down.\nTail wagging can mean many things. While a loose wag means your dog is open and comfortable, a tight wag can mean they are agitated.",
                "Put yourself in a calm state of mind. Very often, your dog's mood will reflect your mood. If you are happy and playful, your dog is more likely to also be happy and playful.[16]\n\nDogs try to read your intention. If you seem uncertain about your intention, they may try to guess; often, they may guess incorrectly.\nBe clear even when you are calm. Dogs like directions, so it's good to tell them what you want and when."

        "wikiHow to Get a Cat to Like You": {
            "intro": "By nature, cats are known to be more independent than dogs.[1] Although your cat’s independence may look like she is being standoffish or aloof, she can actually become very affectionate with you. Her affections will help improve and deepen your relationship with her. Depending on your cat’s personality, getting her to like you and bond with you may take a lot of time and patience. No need to worry, though—the more your cat likes you, the happier she will be, and the happier you will be with her.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn her body language. As your cat gets more comfortable with you, she will demonstrate body language that shows she likes you. Understanding this body language will help you gauge how comfortable your cat is with you. For example, she may demonstrate head bunting, in which she will lower her head and rub the top her head against your head or other body part.[2] This is a clear sign that your cat has affection for you.\n\n\nYour cat has scent glands near her ears, so head bunting is a way for her to leave her scent on you.[3] She may also rub her cheek against you to mark you with her scent.[4] Marking you with her scent is one way of her communicating that she likes you.\nTo show you that she likes you, your cat may establish eye contact with you and softly blink. The eye contact demonstrates that she trusts you.[5] Softly blinking back at her will show her that the trust is mutual.\nImitating some of your cat’s body language back to her, such as the head bunting and soft blinking, will deepen your bond with her and show her that you have affection for her.\nOther examples of her affectionate body language include soft purring, kneading you with her front paws (“making biscuits”), sitting on your lap, and licking you.[6][7]",
                "Provide her with plenty of toys. Toys will keep your cat mentally and physically stimulated in your home. This type of environmental enrichment is a great way to get her to like you. Your cat may prefer certain toys to others, depending on her personality. For example, if she likes to chase things, she may enjoy toys that dangle from a pole.[8]\n\nIf you have an older and/or more sedate cat, she may prefer a toy that she does not have run or chase after, such as a catnip-filled toy that she can play with when laying down.[9]\n\nBe sure to rotate the toys on a regular basis so that she does not become bored with her toy selection.[10]\n\nIf you do not want to spend a lot of money on toys, you can also turn common household items into toys for your cat. For example, empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls and paper bags with the handles removed can be fun for your cat to play with.[11]\n\nBe mindful of toys that your cat should not play with—ribbons, strings, rubber bands—due to the potential of her swallowing them. Swallowing any of these toys could lead them to getting stuck in, and wrapped around, your cat's intestines. This would lead to serious medical problems requiring extensive veterinary care. These medical problems could be even fatal.\nAlso, be aware of toys that have smaller components, such as plastic eyes, that your cat could remove and potentially swallow.[12]\n\nIf you are unsure about which toys would work best for your cat, talk with your veterinarian or visit your local pet store for additional advice.",
                "Schedule regular playtime with your cat. Your cat is likely very independent and can probably entertain herself.[13] However, she still needs to have regular interactions with you to bond with you and like you. Cats tend to be most active at dawn and dusk,[14] so it would be good to schedule your playtime with her at these general times of day.\n\n\nIf your work schedule allows for it, schedule play sessions at dawn and dusk, with each session lasting 5 to 15 minutes. Keep in mind that older or overweight cats may not have the endurance for long play sessions.[15][16]\n\nNo matter what time of day you play with her, make sure that your playtime is at about the same time each day. This will give her something to look forward to, and will help you develop and maintain regular and positive bonding sessions with her.[17]",
                "Maintain a regular feeding schedule. You may not realize it, but feeding your cat is an opportunity to bond with her. In addition, it is very important that your cat see you as her food source. For these reasons, it is preferable to feed your cat at specific times of day, rather than leaving food out for her all day.[18]\n\nIdeally, the first ingredient of her food should be a protein, such as turkey or chicken.[19]\n\nBecause of the wide variety of cat food available at your grocery store and local pet store, consult with your veterinarian to determine which type of food would be best for your cat. Depending on your cat’s age and current health status, some foods may be better for her than others.\nHow often you feed your cat partially depends on her age. Kittens up to 6 months of age should be fed 3 times a day. Twice-daily feedings are good for cats who 6 months of age to 1 year old. Beyond 1 year of age, once-daily feedings should be sufficient.[20]\n\nCertain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can also influence how often you feed your cat.[21]\n\nThe amount to feed your cat will depend on several factors, such as her size, activity level, and age.[22][23] Although there is no 'one size fits all' approach to how much to feed your cat, there are some general weight-based recommendations for dry food: 5 lbs (1/4 to 1/3 cup), 10 lbs (3/8 to 1/2 cup), and 15 lbs (1/2 to 3/4 cup).[24]\n\nConsult with your veterinarian about the amount and type of food you should feed your cat at feeding time.",
                "Give your cat treats. Giving your cat the occasional treat can also be a good way to get your cat to like you. Treats should make up only a small part of your cat's diet (10 to 15% of her daily diet),[25] since they provide little nutritional benefit. A helpful rule of thumb is to give your cat treats no more than 2 to 3 times per week.[26]\n\nCat treats are available at your local pet store and grocery store.\nIn general, do not treat your cat with human food. In fact, some human foods (e.g., grapes, onions, raisins) are toxic to your cat and should be avoided.[27]\n\nCatnip is an excellent treat for cats.[28]\n\nTreats are useful when rewarding her for good behavior.",
                "Pet your cat. Petting is another great way to bond with your cat and get her to like you. Cats love to be petted near the areas of their scent glands: base of the chin, base of the ears, the cheeks behind the whiskers, and the base of the tail. Your cat actually derives enjoyment when she rubs these areas against you or your furniture to mark her territory. Similarly, she will love when you pet her in these areas.[29]\n\nKeep in mind that your cat may not want to be petted all the time, or for long periods of time, even when she’s looking relaxed and content. If her body language tells you that she is overstimulated by petting (dilated pupils, fur twitches, tail wagging like a dog),[30] or she tries to move away from you, give her some space to be alone. Let her dictate how much she is comfortable with you petting her.[31]\n\nWhen you pet her, gently stroke your hand in the areas where she likes to be petted. You can even talk to her in a calm and soothing voice to make the experience more enjoyable for the both of you.\nIn addition to petting your cat, consider brushing and grooming her,[32] if she will let you. Brushing and grooming are ways for you to learn the areas in which your cat likes, and does not like, to be touched.",
                "Have quiet interactions with your cat. This is especially useful if you have a timid or anxious cat. Keeping your interactions quiet and calm will help her warm up to you and become more comfortable with you. Examples of quiet interactions include sitting quietly on the floor or reading a book on the couch when she is in the room with you.[33]",
                "Refrain from petting your cat on her belly. Knowing what your cat does not like will help you avoid doing the things that could jeopardize your bond with her. Unlike dogs, cats generally do not like belly rubs. In fact, if you try to rub her belly, she may instinctively react defensively by extending her claws and trying to bite you.[34]\n\nIn the wild, cats are aware that they can be predator and prey at the same time. The belly houses the most vital organs,[35] so if you reach for her belly when she is unaware of your harmless intentions, her prey mentality might be triggered and she may do all she can to protect that area of her body.\nWhen your cat is stretched out and showing her belly, she may feeling very relaxed and comfortable in her environment.[36] However, she might be demonstrating defensive behavior.[37] To be on the safe side, do not mistake the showing of her belly as your cat's invitation to rub her belly.[38]\n\nEven though some cats may not mind their bellies being rubbed, it is best to avoid this area and pet your cat only in the areas where you know she enjoys being touched.[39]",
                "Do not force interactions with your cat. As mentioned before, follow your cat’s lead when it comes to how much she wants to interact with you.[40] Forcing her to play with you, or trying to pet her when she does not want be petted, will probably make your cat like you less. She may even become fearful of you because she does not trust that you will her respect her space.\n\n\nJust as your cat can show you affectionate body language (e.g., purring, head bunting), she can also let you know when she's had enough and wants to be alone. For example, if she starts growling, hissing, or spitting, give her some space and alone time until she calms down.[41]\n\nYour cat may also simply become physically tired from playing and will probably stop on her own.\nAvoiding forced interactions is especially important if your cat is timid.[42]",
                "Do not yell at or physically punish your cat. Physically punishing your cat is not effective, since she will not be able to make a direct association between her behavior and your punishment. Instead, consider giving her a timeout, during which you simply leave the room without talking to her or interacting with her.[43] Soon enough, she will realize that certain behaviors result in you not interacting with her (a negative result in her mind) and will discontinue those behaviors.[44]\n\nPhysically punishing your cat will likely make her fearful and wary of you.[45]\n\nRather than yelling at her, you can try giving her a firm ‘no’ in a stern voice when she demonstrates bad behavior.[46]"

        "How to Tie a Bow Tie": {
            "intro": "Whether you’re wearing a tuxedo at a wedding or singing in a barbershop quartet, you need to know how to tie a bow tie. It’s not something most of us do very often, but luckily, if you can tie your shoes, you can tie a bow tie because it’s the same knot. It may not feel like it at first since the positioning between tying your shoes and a bow tie is so different, but with some patience and practice, you’ll be tying a bow tie as easily as your shoes!",
            "steps": [
                "Lift up your collar. Though a bow tie can be tied with the collar either up or down, you’ll have a much easier time seeing what you’re doing with the collar up, so lift it and ensure the top button of your shirt is buttoned.[1]\n\nYou should also use a mirror to help you see what you’re doing for the first several times you tie a bow tie.",
                "Measure your neck. Stand up straight and use a tailor’s measuring tape to measure your neck starting from the base of the back of your neck and ending in the front where your collar sits at just around your Adam’s apple.[2]\n\nPlace an index finger between the tape as well to give yourself some breathing room.[3]",
                "Size the bow tie. Bow ties are one size fits all, but they have ways to adjust the length either with a slider or button holes.[4] Most bow ties will also have pre-marked neck measurements informing you how to size them based on your neck measurement.[5] Move the slider or buttons based on your neck measurement.",
                "Place the bow tie around your neck. Like tying a regular necktie, one end of the bow tie needs to drape over your chest longer than the other. Position the bow tie so that one end hangs roughly 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lower than the other end.[6]\n\nAs with a regular necktie, it doesn’t matter which side the longer end is on; however, you’ll be doing most of the work with the hand on which the shorter side of the bow tie starts, so keep that in mind.",
                "Cross the longer end over the shorter end. You should cross the tie near your neck so that the loop around your neck is just large enough to work with but not loose; you don’t want your bow dangling in front of your chest.",
                "Loop the long end under where the two ends cross. With one hand hold the point where the two ends cross over the front of your collar. Take the dangling portion of the longer end and pass it behind and then up over the point of intersection.[7]\n\nAt this point, you can pull both ends of the bow tie to make it as tight around your neck as you will be comfortable with.\nOnce you have the bow tie at the proper tightness, toss the longer end back over your respective shoulder. You won’t need it for the next step.[8]",
                "Fold the dangling end to make a loop. Lift up the shorter end—which is still dangling—and fold it over on itself at the widest part of the bowed shape.[9] Lift the whole portion and turn it 90 degrees, so it faces horizontal.[10] This will form a loop that points to the same side as the shoulder over which the longer end is resting. Hold this fold together at the skinniest part of the bow tie, which should be just in front of your Adam’s apple.\n\nThis will be the front loop of the completed bow tie, so it should already have the general shape of the finished product.",
                "Drop the longer end over the skinny center of the bow. Take the longer end off your shoulder and drape it over the skinniest part of the bow section you created in the last step.",
                "Pinch the bow together in front of the long end. Grab the left and right sides of the horizontally folded end and pinch them together in front of the dangling end.[11] The top of the dangling end will now be held between them.",
                "Feed the middle of the dangling end back through the knot. There will be a small gap behind the bow portion that you can see while you have it pinched forward. Fold the draping end of the bow tie on itself like you did with the short end and pull the loop from the fold through the hole.[12] It will now form the back half of the bow.\n\nThe gap will be between the loose knot from step two and the where you draped the longer end of the bow tie in step four.",
                "Pull at the loops. Pulling at the flat ends of the bow tie will simply untie it like pulling on the dangling strings of shoelaces, so make sure you tighten the bow tie by pulling gently at the looped portions.",
                "Straighten the bow tie. As soon as you finish, the bow tie will likely be crooked, but you can easily twist the loop at the front and back bows to get it into the proper position.\n\nThis may require pulling the flat ends slightly to loosen the bow tie, then repositioning it before tightening it again. Make sure the tie is fastened tightly.",
                "Lower your collar. Your bow tie is now perfectly tied and positioned, so you can put down your collar and finish getting ready.",
                "Check the bow tie periodically. Since you can’t double-knot a bow tie like you can your shoes, they loosen over the course of wear and can even come untied. Check your bow tie periodically to ensure it’s still tight and perfectly positioned."

Fresh grapes also have the ability to improve cognition, eyesight, and blood pressure levels.[1] There are many different ways you can keep grapes fresh and tasty for up to several days and weeks after the purchase date.",
            "steps": [

All white grapes should have a frosty green hue, whereas red and purple grapes should have rich, dark tones.[2]\n\nAvoid purchasing grapes that feature brown discoloration or abnormal hues, which are signs that may indicate rot.",

                "Look for signs of mold on clusters of grapes. If grapes are excessively soft to the touch and are displaying white and gray patches of mold, choose a different bunch of grapes. Mold is a sign of rot and could spread quickly to the remaining healthy grapes in your bunch.",

                "Place grapes into a sealed plastic bag or airtight container without washing them. Washing your grapes will accelerate the ripening process, and will cause them to spoil quickly within 7 days.\n\n\nWash your grapes only if you have plans to freeze them right away. Before placing in the freezer, make sure to line the grapes on a cookie sheet to prevent them from freezing and sticking together, then place them into a separate storage container after each grape has become individually frozen.",
                "Store your grapes at the back of the refrigerator. The space at the back of your refrigerator is often kept cooler, and will help keep your grapes fresh for between 2 and 3 weeks.",

            "intro": "Whether from lifestyle adjustment, conflict, or the development of different interests, everyone experiences a friendship fade from time to time. Maybe you’ve come around and want to see an old disagreement resolved, or simply want to diminish the distance that has crept between you and an old friend. Fortunately, there are clear and constructive steps you can take to indicate your interest in reconnecting and begin the process of revitalizing a friendship.",
            "steps": [
                "Take the first step. Don’t wait for your friend to reach out. If you want to reconnect, make yourself available, either by reaching out or by inviting your friend to meet with you. A phone call or an email are quick, easy, and respectful ways to convey your interest to speak or spend time together. However, you should consider your options regarding how to reach out.",
                "Reach out in the right way. Depending on the degree to which you’ve grown apart, there are different recommended routes to take. The depth of your previous friendship, and the context in which you drifted apart are important factors when considering how you should approach an old friend.[1]\n\nIf you simply haven’t seen or spoken with someone in a while, reach out casually. A message on an online media platform that you both use may work. An email is better because it is a more reliable and secure method of communication. People also tend to check their email more frequently.\nConsider sending a letter. If you had gone through a conflict with your friend, be wary of rekindling old animosities. Take care not to make them feel as though they are under pressure to respond. Don’t just call someone you had a falling out with; this may make them feel uncomfortable or may even upset them. A note or card gives them time to think and contemplate a response.\nDo more than just text. While texting is great way to convey information of send a quick hello, it is not a productive method to rekindle a relationship. If you feel your relationship is casual and comfortable enough to contact a friend via text but you haven’t spoken in a while, give them a call. The more personal approach will indicate your interest to truly reconnect.",
                "Don’t worry about how long it’s been. Don’t feel as though your friendship has ended or become less important. Friendships often change when people get married, move, or have kids. If you’re missing an old friend, there’s a good chance your friend misses you as well. It is always appropriate to try to reconnect.\n\n\nRecognize the importance of circumstances. If you had drifted apart because your friend went through a major life change, and you recently went through a similar life change, you may soon find you have even more in common now than ever before![2]\n\nDon’t wait any longer! The more time you spend missing your friend without acting on it, the further you may drift apart. Know that it’s okay if you haven’t spoken with someone in a while. You may actually make their day by letting them know you’ve been thinking about them and would like to reconnect.",
                "Be persistent, but not over-eager. If your friend doesn’t respond, or does so hesitantly, you can try to convey your hopes to reconnect again. Don’t rush though. Allow time in between contact. If they simply don’t respond, accept the fact that they may not be ready or willing to reconnect for the foreseeable future.[3]",
                "Keep your first (re)meeting short. Know that the present is not the past. Your friend may have changed substantially. Don’t expect them to be the person they were when you were closer.\n\n\nHolding expectations about someone else affects the way you feel about them, which is unfair to them and may lead to unwarranted expectations about the potential to rekindle your friendship.\nMeet for coffee or lunch instead of going out at night together. This will allow each of you to interact more casually, with less assumptions or expectations about the meeting.[4]",
                "Apologize. If you have something to apologize for, do so as soon as you are able. Be completely honest. Know that your friend may still be experiencing some negative emotions about whatever happened between you, and that negative emotions may even arise for you upon meeting up with your friend again.\n\n\nIf you were at fault for something that led to a conflict, even only partially, accept that fault.\nTell your friend that you’re willing to put the past behind you, and that you’re willing to speak about whatever happened if they’d like to do so.[5]\n\nTry something like, \"Hey, George, I'm really sorry about that argument we had. Want to catch a beverage together someday soon and catch up?\"\nTry, \"Sally, you know, I've felt really bad about the way I acted a while back. I'm so sorry. I’d like to get together again sometime, if you’re interested.\"",
                "Listen and Respect. You should always be respectful when interacting with other people, and all the more when interacting with friends. One of the surest ways to indicate that you respect someone is by listening intently during conversation. In order to understand what a friend is feeling or thinking, try to consider your friendship from their perspective.[6]\n\nPractice active listening. Especially during meaningful conversations, make sure to follow these tips to help you listen intently:[7]\nSummarize what it seems like the other person is saying when you are unsure.\nEncourage your friend to continue with short prompts such as “Then?” or “Oh!?”\nUse “I” statements when responding. Reflect about what the other person is saying out loud, by beginning with, “I feel like…”\nIf something is unclear, ask them to expand upon a point you don’t understand.",
                "Recall fond memories. Whatever the context of your friendship now, you undoubtedly have positive memories from experiences you shared together in the past. Recall some of the enjoyable moments you spent together, particularly those that might get you laughing together again.\n\n\nBy recalling positive memories of your own, your friend will likely recall similar memories of their own, and you will both end up remembering more about your friendship than either of you had remembered independently.\nThis alone will rekindle positive feelings towards one another, if not a resurgence of interest in spending time together again.",
                "Forgive. Notice that this step comes after apologizing. Not only do you need to forgive a friend that you hope to continue having a relationship with, you need to forgive them even if they don’t apologize. If you and a friend are not fully able to resolve an issue, you still may be able to have an amicable friendship.\n\n\nKnow that there are learning and growing opportunities for both individuals in every friendship. Respecting one another can help you both find the positive in the relationship you had before and the relationship you will have moving forward.[8]",
                "Follow through on plans. If you commit to getting together, immediately act on it by making specific plans. Talk together about what days or evenings you have free in the coming week and at least settle on a day and time to meet.\n\n\nIf the day comes and you’re not as free as you’d hoped, compromise. Avoid rescheduling if possible; Instead of lunch, meet for coffee. If you’re unable to meet up, make specific plans again.[9]\n\nIf your friend invites you out, go! There is no quicker way to let a friendship fall by the wayside than continually turning down opportunities to spend time together.",
                "Give your friends space. Know that even when a friendship is rekindled, especially after a long period of time, it will likely not feel exactly as it had before.[10] Even if it’s harder to share your lives with one another, you can still value each other’s friendship – you may just have to accept the fact that you won’t get as much time together as you’d like.",
                "Consider whether friendship is still in the cards. Be aware that your hopes or expectations for reconnecting with a friend may be different than their expectations, even if they’re willing to meet. If you meet, but a rekindling of your friendship seems unlikely, leave with the knowledge that you both still respect each other enough to reach out to one another again in the future. In the meantime, don’t allow yourself to be stressed about a situation that is out of your control.[11]",
                "Know that not every friendship is the same. Nor will every friendship stay the same. For that matter, no friendship will ever be perfect. More importantly, the context of your relationships with other human beings will change, perhaps out of the blue.\n\n\nDon’t hold it against your friends when they change. Accept them as they are now, just as you had accepted them when you’d been closer. [12]\n\nUnderstand the difference between types of friendships. In the course of your life, you will have relationships that amount to acquaintances, casual friendships, and close friendships. Put your time and effort into nurturing relationships with those people who value their time with you, respect your perspective, and encourage you to grow in whatever capacity you choose.[13]"

            "intro": "The dumpling purse is a cute, plump and generously sized purse that will easily hold your coins and folded notes. It's a fun style too and quite easy to make if you're an experienced sewer. All you'll need is fabric, lining, some thread and a zipper.",

                "Draw the basic shape for the purse onto pattern paper. Follow the black outline as shown in the image; the main outline on the outermost side of the purse shape is for the outer fabric for the purse, and its eventual inner lining (not the batting but the lining), while the two inner outlines are for the batting or felt rests of the purse (each of these pieces look a little like a basic crown shape). These drawings will form the template. Note that the size is dependent on the size you want the final purse to be, so adjust the template size according to your need.\n\n\nIncorporate a 1cm/2.5 inch seam allowance for the outer piece of fabric when finalizing the size. The inner pieces of batting or felt rests will sit as shown in the template image, so ensure that when drawing them to size, they are at an evenly spaced distance from the outer piece's edges on all sides, such as an even 2cm/5 inch distance from the edge, or whatever fits well with the dimensions you're applying (this width will vary depending on the size you've chosen for the purse).",
                "Cut out the paper templates. You will reuse the outer fabric template for the lining as well, so use with care.",

                "Repeat for the cotton lining fabric. Lay the outer fabric template onto the lining fabric cotton and pin in place. Then cut out the shape.",
                "Place the batting or felt rest pieces on the lining fabric. Cut out the two batting or felt rest pieces.",
                "Attach the two batting or felt rest pieces to the wrong side of the outer fabric piece. Position them as shown in this step's image; these pieces will help hold the shape of the purse and buffer it from being squashed when in use. Use fabric glue to attach these two batting pieces. The fabric is now ready for sewing; see the image for what you should have in front of you now.",
                "Fold the outer fabric in half. Have the wrong side facing outward. Sew the two side edges together, from the bottom up to the top. Leave the two curved edges at the top unsewn.",

                "Fold the purse. See the image for points A and B. Using these points, fold the bag so as to bring points A and B to match together. Clip or pin these two sides together, to hold the purse shape in place, in readiness for sewing.",
                "Sew the two edges of one of the clipped sides together. The other side will be left open for the addition of the zipper shortly. Then sew in the zipper on the remaining open side. Use the image to guide you.",

        "How to Change Your Name in Pennsylvania": {
            "intro": "Many people wish to change their names, or the name of their minor child, in order to get a new start in life. Pennsylvania law governs the procedures by which a person’s name can be changed in the state of Pennsylvania.[1]The Office of the Prothonotary (also called the \"Office of Judicial Records\" in some places) in your county of residence is where you will submit the documents necessary to change your name. This office is typically located in each county’s courthouse.[2]There are different procedures to follow, depending on the reason for changing your name and whether it involves an adult or a minor child. It is up to the court whether to order a name change.",
            "steps": [
                "File a Petition for Name Change in your local Prothonotary’s office. You should file your paperwork in the county in which you live. Some Prothonotary offices have sample petitions for you to fill out. Other offices require that you write your own petition. This step starts the name change process.[3]Your petition must contain the following information:\n\n\nYour desire and intention to change your name\nYour reason for asking for a name change, which can be any reason that the Court will approve. However, you may not change your name to avoid creditors, commit fraud, or because you don’t want others to know that you have committed crimes in the past.\nYour current address\nAll of your addresses for the five years prior to filing your petition",
                "File any other required forms. These forms differ in each county. However, they may include a Civil Cover Sheet, a Court Administration Office Scheduling Sheet, and an Order for Publication and Notice. Your county Prothonotary office may have these forms for you to fill out, or you may need to write your own forms. These forms are usually just to ensure that your case moves properly through the court system and that you complete all of the required steps to change your name.",
                "Pay the court’s filing fee. The amount of this fee varies widely from county to county, ranging from about $97.00 to $328.00. You can file an In Forma Pauperis (IFP) petition and order if needed. This petition asks the court to waive the normal fee because you receive public assistance or are otherwise unable to afford the fee or are considered to be low-income. If the judge agrees to waive the court’s fee, you will receive a signed order waiving the filing fee by mail.[4]",
                "Get your fingerprints taken. When you file your Petition for Change of Name, the court will issue an order that directs you to have your fingerprints taken. You may be able to receive that order from the court the same day that you file your petition, or you may receive it later in the mail. Using this order, you can set up an appointment with your local police department in order to get your fingerprints taken. The police department is likely to charge you a fee to get your fingerprints taken. The court will use your fingerprints to check your criminal history with the Pennsylvania State Police. If you have been convicted of certain crimes, you may not be eligible to change your name.[5]",
                "Get an Order for Publication and Notice signed by the judge. After your fingerprints have been submitted, the court will schedule a hearing. You will receive a hearing date by mail, along with a completed Order for Publication and Notice. This Order directs you to publish notice that you wish to change your name.",
                "Publish notice of your intended name change. Your notice also will contain the date of the hearing that has been scheduled on your request to change your name. This allows any interested person to attend the hearing and object to your proposed name change.[6]Your publication notice must follow these guidelines:\n\n\nThe notice must be published one time in two newspapers of general circulation in your county of residence or in a nearby county. You can use any newspaper in those locations. Since the fees may vary, you may wish to check with several newspapers to see which costs less. Your Prothonotary’s Office can tell you which newspapers are generally used and how to contact them.\nA copy of the newspaper notice will serve as evidence that you have properly published the notice of your intended name change.\nThe court can waive the publication requirement if it finds that publishing notice would jeopardize the your safety.",
                "Present proof of financial standing to the court. You typically satisfy this requirement by submitting an official judgment or lien check showing no outstanding judgments. This document must be signed by the Prothonotary’s office. Depending on your county’s requirements, you also may need to get searches done by the Clerk of Court’s Office and the Recorder of Deeds Office. You must provide proof of these searches to the court.\n\n\nYou must request that these searches be performed individually by each office. Each office may have a different form for making this request. Some offices in some counties may even require you to conduct the search yourself.\nThe Prothonotary’s Office and the Clerk of Court’s Office are typically located in your county courthouse. The Recorder of Deeds Office also may be in the courthouse or in another local government building, depending on your county.\nEach office may charge a fee for the search requests. The amount of this fee is different in every office and varies from one county to the next.\nOnce you have paid the fee and the search is complete, the office will give you a signed document that states the results of the search. This is the document that you will present to the court when you attend your hearing.",
                "Attend a court hearing. Your court hearing typically will be about one to three months from the date that your petition for name change is filed. This gives you plenty of time to publish the required notices. At the court hearing, the court will determine if you eligible for a name change. If you qualify under Pennsylvania law, the court will order your name change. Some people do not qualify for a name change. If the judge denies your petition for name change, you do have the right to appeal. However, the appeal process is complex and you probably should consult with an attorney first before attempting to file an appeal on your own. You will not be eligible for a name change for the following reasons:\n\n\nTo avoid creditors or debts that you owe\nTo commit fraud or similar criminal acts\nTo avoid people knowing about your past criminal convictions",
                "Obtain the required forms. An Election or Notice to Resume Maiden Name form for an adult who wants to change her name after a divorce is generally available in most Prothonotary offices in each county. Filing this form will allow you to change your name from a married surname to a prior surname if you are newly divorced.[7]The Prothonotary’s office will charge a fee to change your name. This fee typically ranges from $19.00 for a person who was divorced in her county of residence, to $42.00 for a person who was divorced in another county or state. However, these fees vary by county.",

If your divorce was filed in another county or state, you will need to place a certified copy of your divorce decree on file in the Prothonotary’s office. You can get a certified copy of the divorce decree from the Prothonotary office in the county in which you were divorced, or from the county clerk’s office if you were divorced in another state. If your divorce was granted in the county in which you are filing for a name change, you do not need to provide a copy of your divorce decree to the Prothonotary’s office.[9]",
                "File the completed Election or Notice to Resume Maiden Name form, birth certificate, and divorce decree in the Prothonotary’s office. Once you have filed the required paperwork, you have effectively given notice of your intent to return to using a prior surname. This is all you have to do to start using your prior name under Pennsylvania law.",
                "Change your name with the Social Security Administration. You can change your name on your social security card to your spouse’s surname by bringing your marriage certificate to your local Social Security Administration branch office. You also will need to present a copy of a valid photo identification card, such as a driver’s license. There is no fee for changing your name with the Social Security Administration. You will receive your new social security card in the mail.[10]",

Once you have obtained a new social security card and driver’s license showing your new married surname, you can take those documents to other offices to have your name changed there, as well. Some places will want to see your marriage certificate along with your new social security card and driver’s license, and they may require you to fill out their own internal forms in order to change your name. Other places where you may need to change your name include:\n\n\nYour employer\nInstitutions that service your retirement accounts\nBanks and credit unions\nCredit card accounts\nInsurance policies, including medical, dental, vision, life, and disability",

                "Mail the form to the Department of Vital Statistics. You must include a legible copy of one parent’s government-issued ID card with the form. If you want the original birth certificate returned to you, you also must include a $4 fee. The only exception is if you provide proof of membership in the Armed Forces. In that case, you don’t have to pay the $4 fee.[13]",

You also should show the new birth certificate to other offices that need the child’s correct name, such as his or her school and doctor’s office.",
                "Consult with an attorney. Changing the name of a minor child can be complicated. The court does not have to grant your request to change your child’s name. An attorney can evaluate your situation and advise you whether you are likely to be successful in changing your child’s name.",
                "File a petition to change your child’s name. You must file the petition in the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which you live.",

If the judge agrees to waive the court’s fee, you will receive a signed order waiving the filing fee by mail.",

You must send notice of the petition for name change to the other parent by registered or certified mail. You should ask for a return receipt when mailing the notice. You must file the return receipt along with a certificate of service with the court. This proves that you properly gave notice to the other parent.[14]",
                "Prove that the name change is in the best interest of the child. The court will hold a hearing to determine if the child’s name should be changed.

        "wikiHow to Prevent Flea Bites": {
            "intro": "Fleas are the bane of pet owners everywhere. These pesky pests cause itchy, bothersome bites on humans and their pets. Some pets can even be allergic to their bites and fleas can carry diseases. Preventing flea bites is achieved by effective flea control. Talk to your veterinarian about the best parasite control for your pets and clean your home to ensure you remove any fleas or eggs in the environment — otherwise, it may take weeks to get the infestation under control. Remember that fleas want to feed on your pets and not you, so you need to treat all the animals in your house for fleas, even if only one is infested. Products must be used regularly (at interval stated on the label) to prevent reinfestation.",
            "steps": [
                "Visit your vet to get monthly flea control products. Your veterinarian can give you flea control medications that are administered orally or by injection and are more likely to work than many over-the-counter brands. Some other treatments are topical solutions.\n\n\nTry topical or spot-on medication. These medications absorb from the skin into the pet’s bloodstream. They are applied to a small area on the pet’s back directly on the skin. From there, they work to paralyze and kill fleas after they feed on the pet. Ingredients in these products vary and may include: fipronil, imidacloprid, metaflumizone, permethrin, pyriproxyfen, selamectin, and spinosad. NEVER use permethrins on cats.\nConsider oral tablets. These are given once a month. Some of the tablets only stop the egg from developing into an adult, so another product will need to be used to kill adult fleas. There is also a quick-acting product will only kill fleas for 24 hours.\nFor cats, there is an injection available which will control fleas for up to 6 months. A veterinarian will need to give the injection. There is the potential for side effects. These include reactions to the injection at the site of injection, vomiting, and loss of appetite.\nTreat all the pets in your house.\nBe aware not all products sold to kill fleas are effective. You can purchase over-the-counter flea prevention drops or pills but these may not be effective in treating or preventing fleas. Take care to read the label instructions for proper dosage.",
                "Keep your pet inside when fleas are rampant. Fleas are usually at their worst from March to October, depending on where you live. They like warm, humid weather, preferring temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit and 75% humidity.[1]",
                "Try a flea collar. Some collars are highly effective, but others are not. Effective collars, such as Seresto brand collars, require a veterinary prescription. Be cautious about collars that do not need a script as they are less likely to be effective. Always follows the directions on the package. When used with flea and tick shampoos they can be a good option for flea control. DO NOT use dog flea collars on cats.",
                "Make a homemade flea collar with essential oils. While not scientifically proven to help, many claim to have success with making an essential oil flea collar and putting it on their pet to keep fleas from biting. Mix two to three drops of cedar or lavender essential oil with one to two tablespoons of water. Drip some of this mixture onto a bandanna. Rub the sides of the bandanna fabric together to rub in the scent. Then tie the bandanna around your pet’s neck. [2]",
                "Add apple cider vinegar to your dog’s water. Although there isn't scientific evidence that proves its effectiveness, many think that apple cider vinegar can repel fleas. Add one teaspoon of all-natural apple cider vinegar to one quart of drinking water for your dog. This may deter fleas as the vinegar works its way through the dog’s bloodstream and is emitted through his skin.[3]",
                "Try brewer’s yeast in your pet’s meal. Despite the fact that there's no scientific evidence of effectiveness, brewer’s yeast is thought to repel fleas. Many think this is especially true in hot, muggy climates. For a cat or small dog, add half a teaspoon of brewer’s yeast to the pet’s meal by sprinkling it over the food. Use one teaspoon if your dog is over 30 pounds, and add a teaspoon for every 30 pounds beyond that.",
                "Vacuum your house daily. While this may seem excessive, it's actually a vital part of removing fleas from your home. Since fleas lay eggs that may hatch after you've treated your pet, you need to remove the eggs and larvae that fall to the floor or on furniture. Vacuum every day for a few weeks to ensure that a new cycle of fleas won't trouble you.\n\n\nRemember to throw the vacuum bag away in an outdoor dumpster or empty the bagless vacuum canister into the outdoor dumpster. If you leave the dirt in the vacuum bag or canister, the fleas can easily work their way back into your home.[4]\n\nEggs and fleas can also get trapped in fabric on couches, pet bedding and other upholstered furniture. Vacuum upholstery every day for a few weeks.",
                "Use diatomaceous earth in your house. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural and safe alternative for killing fleas in your house. DE is similar in consistency to talcum powder.[5] It can be sprinkled on carpets, baseboards, and other places in your house. Let it sit for a few days and then vacuum it up.",
                "Use a flea insecticide with a growth inhibitor. This type of insecticide will restrict the growth of fleas and eggs. Check that the product will kill fleas/eggs for up to 7 months.\n\n\nStrictly follow the instructions. Make sure to remove all pets from the area when you are applying this insecticide. Don't forget birds and other pets in cages. Be sure to also cover aquariums when using these products.",
                "Wash bedding and upholstery in hot water. Strip as much of the fabric off your couches, chairs, and bed as you can. Then, wash it in the hottest water your fabric will allow. This should kill fleas and their eggs.[6]\n\nGather up any clothes that may be lying around, especially piles of laundry. Fleas will nest in fabrics. Washing and drying on the hottest setting possible will kill fleas and eggs.",
                "Use a lemon citrus spray. Fleas don’t like the scent of lemon and will avoid things with this smell. By applying a lemon spray around your house and on your pets, you can drive the fleas away, at least temporarily.\n\n\nMake a lemon citrus spray by cutting 6 lemons in half and boiling them in water. Steep the lemons in the water overnight. Pour the lemon water into a clean spray bottle. Place in a spray bottle and apply to fabrics and furniture around your house. You can also spritz your animals with lemon spray.[7]\n\nTest inconspicuous areas first to make sure it doesn’t bleach or damage the item being sprayed.",
                "Use a diffuser and essential oils that repel fleas. Set up several diffusers throughout your house. Choose oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, cedar wood, lemon, or peppermint.[8]\n\nYou can also look for lotions that contain these essential oils. Apply the lotion to your skin, which will repel the fleas.",
                "Apply an insecticide in your house. Most general bug sprays prevent against fleas, so apply the spray if you notice fleas in your house. One with an insect growth inhibitor will be longer lasting killing any fleas which hatch for up to 7 months.[9]\n\nConsider the health hazards of insecticides. Always read labels carefully to avoid accidental poisoning.[10]",
                "Consider applying insecticide to your yard. If it's flea season, spraying insecticide in your yard will kill off fleas and eggs. Look for a product that's been approved by the EPA and is safe to use on your plants.[11]",
                "Get nematodes for your yard. Nematodes are small worms that feed on fleas. Ladybugs are also good additions to your yard, as they feed on fleas as well. Visit your local garden center to get some of these flea predators.[12]",
                "Use a flea comb on your pet. A flea comb is a very fine-toothed comb easily found in pet supply stores, the pet aisle in discount stores, or at a veterinary office. Work the comb down to the pet’s skin and slowly comb through the fur. If there are fleas, you'll see small black flakes or even fleas as you pull the comb through the fur. [13]",
                "Wear white socks around your house. When you're at home, spend some time wearing white socks. This will make it easier to spot fleas. If you notice a bunch of tiny black spots on your socks, this may be a sign of a flea infestation. These might show up as actual fleas that may jump on your ankles and feet, or these specks may also be flea dirt.[14]",
                "Watch your pet for behavioral changes. You may notice your pet scratching or furiously nibbling at itself if it's being bothered by fleas.",
                "Check your skin for flea bites. If you have flea bites, you might have small pink and red bumps or spots which may be itchy.[15]\n\nYou might find flea bites at the fold of a joint, such as at your elbow, knee or ankle.\nThese bumps will turn white when you press on them.",
                "Administer flea medication obtained from your vet. If you haven't already, talk to your vet about treatment options for your pet. These may include topical treatments, oral medication, or injections. These will kill the fleas on your pet and prevent reinfestation.\n\n\nAgain, keep in mind that not all of these treatments work. Talk to your vet about the best treatment for your pets.",
                "Give your pet a flea bath or a flea dip. This can kill the fleas that are currently on your pet, though it will not prevent them or do anything if there are fleas in the environment that jump back on to your pet. Look for a pet shampoo or dip that will kill fleas, larvae, and eggs.\n\n\nTake extra care to wash your pet’s head after you've washed his body. Fleas might try jumping onto the head to avoid being washed.\nBe sure to follow the directions for use and frequency and completely rinse the product off of your pet.[16]\n\n\nDO NOT use dog shampoo or dips on cats.\nKeep in mind that these types of product will cleanse the pet, but they do not have persistent action to stop the pet from becoming reinfected. You must use another product (such as a spot-on treatment or collar) to prevent reinfestation.",
                "Try a spray or powder. Flea sprays and powders, available at pet stores, are applied to the pet’s fur. They may need to be worked in to reach the skin to kill the adult fleas.\n\n\nFollow the instructions on the package for proper use.",
                "Never use a dog product on a cat or vice versa. Flea control products are specially formulated for use on a certain type of pet. They are not interchangeable. Do not use a dog-formulated product on your cat, and vice versa."

        "wikiHow to Potty Train a Puppy in an Apartment": {
            "intro": "Potty training a puppy is a little trickier when you have an apartment, since you can't install a doggie door or easily let your furry companion outside. The key is to start early and be consistent. Place your dog on a regular feeding schedule so you can predict when she'll need to go outside, and reward her every time she demonstrates good behavior. Before you know it, your puppy will run to the door and wag her tail instead of having indoor accidents. Read on to learn more about how to potty train a puppy in an apartment.",
            "steps": [
                "Take your puppy outside frequently. A young puppy (8 weeks) needs to be given the opportunity to go outside every 20 minutes, if you are to increase the chances of her peeing outside rather than inside. Older puppies also need to relieve themselves frequently, as they can't physically hold their bladder for more than an hour or two.[1] To avoid accidents, scoop up your puppy and take her outside once an hour like clockwork. This way your puppy will learn to associate going outside with going to the bathroom.\n\n\nOnce you get to know your puppy, you'll be able to watch for signs she needs to relieve herself. As soon as you see her displaying the signs, take her outside.\nWhen you're house training a puppy, it's very important that you be available to meet her needs at all times of the day. If you leave her alone in the apartment all day it might take a very long time for her to understand what she's supposed to do when she needs to go to the bathroom. If you can't be with her all day long, have a friend stay with her.",
                "Feed your puppy at the same time every day. This helps to reinforce a routine and allows you to better predict when she may need to go outside. Depending on your puppy's breed and needs, feed her a few times a day. Take your puppy outside after every meal and after she drinks a lot from her water bowl.",
                "Pick a designated place for your puppy to relieve herself outside. Going to the same spot every time will help her remember what she's supposed to do. Living in an apartment building, you might have trouble getting all the way to the closest park. Pick a patch of grass close enough to your apartment entrance that your puppy won't have an accident on the way.\n\n\nBe sure to follow your city's ordinances regarding disposing of dog waste. Pick up after your puppy using a plastic bag.\nDog urine isn't generally good for flowers, so try to find a public spot that isn't being tended by a careful gardener. You might find yourself the subject of a sign warning dog owners to stay away - a common sight near city apartment buildings!",
                "Use a command to help your puppy associate the spot with relieving herself. Say something like \"go potty\" or just \"potty\" when you set her in the designated spot. Use language to strengthen the puppy's association with the spot. Make sure you don't use the word indoors; just use it in the special spot.",
                "Reward your puppy when she relieves herself outside. The best way to train a puppy is to reinforce good behavior and eliminate possibilities for bad behavior. When your puppy relieves herself outside, giving her praise and a treat will make her want to do it again. Say \"good girl\" or \"good boy\" in a loving tone and give your puppy some cuddles. You can also give her a small treat each time she goes correctly.\n\n\nIn order for positive reinforcement to work effectively as a training strategy, consistency is key. That means that every single time your puppy relieves herself outside, you should praise her. This is especially important in the first few months, when she's still learning correct behavior.",
                "Confine your puppy to a certain area in the apartment. You can gate off your kitchen using a child or dog gate or choose a different room. This is necessary during the first few months, since keeping your puppy in one place allows you to keep an eye on her so you can take her outside right away when she shows signs of needing to relieve herself. If she has too much freedom, she'll end up going to the bathroom before you can catch her to take her outside.\n\n\nYour puppy is ready to spend time in the rest of the apartment after she has learned to signal to you that she needs to go outside, either by moving toward the door or looking at it. You'll also know she's ready when she has very few accidents in the apartment.",
                "Consider having an indoor bathroom spot. If your apartment is on a high floor in your building, it might be difficult to get outside in time for your puppy to go to the bathroom. If you have a small dog who makes manageable messes, you can consider paper training your dog instead of taking her outside every time. Line an area of the room with newspapers or special training pads you can buy at the pet store. Use the same training method you'd use for an outdoor bathroom spot, carrying your puppy to the papers each time she has to go. Reward her when she goes successfully.[2]\n\nYou can also use a sod box as a place for your puppy to eliminate. Fill a shallow plastic container with sod or dog litter, and place it on top of newspapers.[3]\n\nWhen you clean up after an accident your puppy has had, you can place the soiled paper towels or rags in the designated area so that your puppy associates the smell of urine with her bathroom spot.",
                "Keep your puppy in a crate at night and while you're away. Puppies actually like the feeling of being in a small, cozy crate - it makes them feel safe and secure. For this reason you should never use a crate as a form of punishment; it should be your puppy's personal safe place. Puppies don't like soiling their living space, so make sure you take your puppy outside so she can go to the bathroom right before you put her in the crate.\n\n\nPuppies can sleep for about 4 hours before they need to relieve themselves. Very young puppies might wake up barking, though, so you should line the crate with towels just in case your puppy has an accident in the night.\nIf you hear your puppy barking in the crate, take her outside to relieve herself and place her back in the crate. Be sure you reward her when she relieves herself.",
                "Clean up accidents right away. If your puppy has an accident in her crate or elsewhere inside, be sure to clean it up and sanitize the spot so it no longer smells like urine. If an area smells like urine the puppy will instinctively want to relieve herself in the same spot again.",
                "Don't scold your puppy for having an accident.[4] Puppies don't respond well to negative reinforcement; it only makes them afraid. If your puppy is relieving herself in your apartment, pick her up and immediately take her outside to the designated bathroom spot. When she successfully finishes doing her business there, reward her before taking her back inside.\n\n\nNever yell at your puppy or spank her when you see her having an accident. You will teach your puppy to be afraid of you, and it won't help her learn what to do when she needs to relieve herself.\nIf you find a mess in your apartment after the deed has been done, don't ever rub your puppy's nose in it or try to discipline her. It doesn't work; it just confuses the puppy. Simply clean up the mess and take the puppy outside more often to continue her training."

        "wikiHow to Catch Yellow Perch": {
            "intro": "Yellow Perch is a freshwater fish found in the United States and Canada. Commonly referred to as simply “perch,” this fish is light yellow with dark vertical stripes. It ranges in size from four to 15 inches (38.1 cm), and usually tops off at four pounds. The sweet, delicate meat is excellent fried.",
            "steps": [
                "Look in North American ponds, lakes, rivers and streams. Perch are common across the US and Canada. Since they're available in so many spots, and they're relatively easy to catch, perch fishing is a popular activity among anglers and families alike. Look for perch in these places in particular:\n\n\nMississippi River\nGreat Lakes\nFreshwater areas in the Midwestern, Northeastern and Northwestern US\nFreshwater areas in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Quebec",
                "Fish for perch in late summer, fall and winter. Perch are active all year round, so you can technically fish them at any time of year. However, the period from late summer through early spring is the best time to catch perch.[1].\n\n\nDuring warmer weather, perch are found in shallower waters.\nIn the winter, they go deeper. Ice fishing for perch is popular in winter.[2]",
                "Look for perch at sunrise and sunset. During these periods, perch are most active in shallow waters. They're also easy to find in morning and late afternoon. Don't bother fishing for perch at night, though, since they're rarely active once the sun goes down.",
                "Fish near rocks and edges. Like many fish species, perch can often be found near rocky areas or edges of structures that provide shelter. They like to move among piles of rocks and wood, rather than spending time in completely open water. Look for places with an abundance of underwater structure or plentiful vegetation.[3]\n\nIf you're new to a particular lake, pond or stream, go to the local bait and tackle shop and ask where the perch like to hang out. You can often get wind of the best fishing spots by asking others with local experience.",
                "Use a light jig. Using a jig 5 to 5 ½ inches in length is best. You want to be able to feel the slightest nibble.[4] However, if the weather is windy or you aim to catch bigger fish, you'll need a slightly heavier jig so you can maintain control.",
                "Try a basic rod and reel combination. It’s a popular choice and works well for open water fishing.[5] There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to choosing your rod and reel combination for catching perch. Whatever you're comfortable with should work just fine when you're fishing open water from a boat.\n\n\nYou might want to consider getting a fast action rod tip. This helps you detect subtle bites, which is helpful since perch are known for stealing bait.\nGet a shorter rod to use in the winter. Ice fishing rods are 3 feet (0.9 m) in length.\nYou should choose the lightest line possible for the type of fishing you’re doing. 4 to 6 pound test line is preferred.[6]",
                "Use a small lure. Perch have small mouths and need a smaller-sized lure. There are dozens of choices, many of which have been used to great affect, but the one sixty-fourth and one thirty-second leadhead lures are the most popular to use for fishing perch. Pick out lures with an array of different-colored skirts, since there’s no telling what the perch will like on a given day.",
                "Use live bait. Perch prefer live bait, although some anglers have had success with crayfish meat. Ask around at the local bait and tackle shop to find out what perch in your particular area like to eat. These are the most popular choices:\n\n\nMinnows\nInsect larvae\nNight worms",
                "Fish from a boat in open water when it's chilly. This makes it easier to access the deeper waters where perch like to spend time throughout the fall and winter months. It's also easier to move to a new spot if they're just not biting where you set up at first.[7]",
                "Fish from the shore near structures when it's warm. This is especially effective in early spring, when they tend to be in shallower places. Look for a spot near a rock pile, wood pile, or plenty of vegetation on the floor of the pond, lake or river. Fish near places where structures meet open water.",
                "Fish near the bottom. No matter how shallow the water is, or what time of year, the perch will be near the bottom of the lake, pond or river you're fishing. You'll be more successful if you can position the bait there.",
                "Consider using a sonar fishfinder. Perch commonly travel in schools and hide in the dense vegetation or mud. A good technique is to use sonar to locate the schools of yellow perch, then choose a jig that resembles the vegetation or mud in which they are hiding.\n\n\nMaggots with weights forcing them to sink to the bottom should be used when the schools are feeding on insects and plankton.\nBobbers should be added to the line when perch are schooling in plant vegetation. This will help keep your bait still and prevent the perch from steeling it off the hook.",
                "Try various techniques. You need to figure out how to best reach the perch where you are. If something isn’t working, try a new technique. Just as your bait should be adjusted to attract perch according to their current feeding location, you should also adjust your technique to fit the situation.\n\n\nAllow the bait to hit the bottom before wheeling back in.\nIf you have hit in one spot and then the bites have quieted, cast in a circle around the boat.\nRun the boat motor, perch are attracted by the noise and vibration.\nHit the rod against the bottom, then move the rod in quick little flicks to make the bait vibrate.",
                "Land fish quickly when the action starts. You might wait for hours to get a nibble, but when you catch one, many more usually follow, since perch hang out in schools. Land each fish and get your line back out to catch more."

A frown typically conveys frustration or anger, but you may have a tendency to frown even when you are not experiencing those emotions. Smiling and laughter may improve your physical and mental health, so this is the best response. Through controlling your facial expressions and monitoring and improving your mood, you can begin to frown less and smile more.",

                "Remind yourself that smiling and laughter is good for body and soul. Smiling more and incorporating laughter into your daily life has a positive impact on your overall well-being. Smiling and laughter is also contagious, so you may be able to influence the moods of those around you.\n\nSmiling and laughing can also help to decrease stress. When you are smiling and laughing, your stress levels decrease, similar to the way that exercising causes your body to release feel-good chemicals called endorphins.\nWhen you consciously make an effort to smile and laugh daily, you may become more resilient to life’s challenges. Being more resilient in difficult situations can help you to feel happy and be more successful.",
                "Relax your forehead. Perhaps the easiest way to cease frowning so much is to relax your forehead when you feel tension in your face. You can even massage between your two eyebrows using your index and middle finger when you feel your brows furrowing.[1]",
                "Consider getting glasses. You may be frowning and furrowing your brows because you are having issues with your sight. This may be forcing you to squint or frown. If you have been having headaches lately, your vision is blurry, or your sight has changed, consider seeing an eye doctor. They will be able to prescribe glasses, contacts or perhaps even Lasik surgery if necessary.[2]",
                "Keep a mirror on your desk. If possible, keep a mirror on your desk at work to monitor your expression and correct it if you see yourself frowning. If you are currently in school and there is a mirror in your classroom, try to situate yourself in sight of it.[3]\n\nWhen you are at home, sit near a mirror as well.\nDon’t stare at yourself constantly. Look occasionally to ensure that you are not frowning.\nPractice facial expressions in the mirror. Practice smiling and then resting your face. Repeat the process for a few minutes.",
                "Enlist the help of others. Your family and friends can be particularly helpful in assisting you on your quest to stop frowning. Communicate to them this wish and ask them to tell you when you are frowning. Frowning may have become so natural to you that you do not even realize that you are doing it. Since you can’t see your face unless you are in front of a mirror, as your friends to let you know when your face develops a scowl.[4]\n\nYou might say to them “Hey, I have noticed that people tell me I frown a lot, but I don’t even notice I’m doing it. Can you tell me when you see me frowning so I can learn to stop doing it?”",
                "Place tape on your forehead. When you are at home, and even while you are sleeping, you can train yourself to stop frowning. Take a piece of clear plastic tape and place it between your eyebrows. This will create a barrier on your skin to prevent you from frowning using your eyebrows. You might be frowning during your sleep as well, so this will begin correcting the issue even when you are not awake.[5]\n\nTry not to put the tape on any of your eyebrow hairs so that you don’t cause irritation when you take the tape off.",
                "Smile. Though practicing facial expressions will assist you in your efforts to frown less, sometimes it is necessary to fake it until you make it.

                "Wear sunglasses when outside. On particularly sunny days, you may be forced to squint to protect your eyes from the harmful rays of the sun, which can cause you to frown. However, consider wearing sunglasses to prevent yourself from furrowing your brow.",
                "Assess where the tension comes from. Perhaps a frown is not your natural expression but is instead a symptom of the stress that exists in your life. Throughout your day when you or someone else catches you frowning, assess the stressors that exist in your environment.[7]\n\nFor instance, perhaps you tend to frown when you see a certain person or are given an assignment in a certain class.\nJournal out these stressors to keep track of them and their frequency.",
                "Eliminate or alleviate stress. After determining these stressors, identify which you can get rid of and which you can work to dissipate the effects of. Your frowning can be significantly reduced and perhaps even eradicated completely if you work to get rid of these issues.\n\n\nFor instance, perhaps your significant other texts you throughout your day about all of the issues they are having at work, causing you stress. Perhaps you can ask them to tell you once you are off work or perhaps during your lunch break so that you don’t get distracted.",
                "Write down a list of things you’re looking forward to. During the day, when you catch yourself frowning, take a break from your frustration and write down a list of things you are excited about. You can include items that are simple, like having a nice meal after work, or larger things like going on vacation in a week.[8]\n\nThis mini journaling exercise will grant you respite from whatever tension exists and allow you to focus on something that is more positive.",
                "Encourage yourself to laugh. Perhaps one of the best ways to stop frowning so much is to start laughing more! Watch more comedies and throughout your day, you will remember the funny parts and smile more. This is a great way to inject more humour into your life.[9]\n\nGoogle jokes or download a joke app to your phone.\nDownload or screenshot funny pictures or memes and revisit them throughout your day.\nSpend more time with your funny friends.",
                "Make fun plans to look forward to. If you don’t feel that you have many things to look forward to, or even if you do, begin to make some fun plans for yourself or with friends. Consider things like taking a vacation, going to the beach for the day, or going to see a movie that you’ve been wanting to check out.[10]\n\nAsk your friends if they have any suggestions.",
                "Take breaks. Sometimes, you might be frowning because you have been working too long or too hard on a difficult project. Remember that you cannot work at your optimal level unless you are taking proper care of yourself, which includes giving yourself space from your work at times. If you find yourself frowning often while completing a task, take a five minute break to listen to a song or to take a walk outside.\n\n\nYou can also get a snack to revive your spirits.",
                "Address negative comments. You might find that your frowning is eliciting comments from others. People might say things to you like “Wow, you always look so angry.” These comments, especially if they happen often, can be quite annoying and rude. However, you should be prepared to respond to them respectfully yet directly.[11]\n\nYou might say something like “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I am perfectly fine. Thank you for asking.”",
                "Show kindness to others. Another way to improve your mood and stop your frowning is by giving back to others. Whether it’s a small act like picking up a coffee for a friend or coworker or something larger like volunteering for a day at a soup kitchen, take some time to show kindness to someone. Giving back is bound to put a smile on your face.[12]"

You should consider what financial resources, ie. cash and credit, that you can access to implement your business idea. Next consider whether you will need to make the implementation of your business idea a full-time job, a part-time endeavor, or whether others can implement the plan on your behalf.[1]",
                "Research similar products and services. If you have a good business idea, your first step should be to research whether other products or services exist that are similar to your business idea. Don’t worry if you find similar business models, this could simply mean that there is a strong market that is worth entering. Furthermore, the presence of potential competitors can be used to identify the needs of consumers that are currently not being met by existing businesses.[2]\n\nResearch customer feedback on the services and products provided by identified potential competitors. Once the limitations of your competitors are identified you can structure your business proposal in a manner that offers solutions to these limitations in order to create a unique offering to the public.\nIf you are unable to locate similar services and products, this may be a sign that your business idea will be a great success because it will fulfill the needs of an underserved market.\nHowever, the absence of a market for your business product or service could indicate the difficulty of successfully implementing the business idea underlying your proposal.",
                "Consider potential marketing strategies. Take the time to brainstorm how you would market your goods, products or services to the public. Consider the successful marketing companies of your potential competitors. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these campaigns in order to learn from the mistakes of others.[3] If you can't figure out a potential marketing strategy that will be successful, the idea should be a no go.\n\n\nReview competitor advertisements and other marketing tools used by competitors to attract potential customers.\nDetermine the key elements of each competitor's marketing approach - low cost, high quality, superior service, and so on.",
                "Research potential costs associated with implementing your business plan. How much do you expect to get paid, if at all, during the development stage and beyond? How much start-up capital will you need to kick it off?[4] To figure this out, start with potential revenues, rather than costs. How many units will you sell at what price, based upon your market analysis? The price of a product is generally determined by the competitor's prices. Unless you have something special, you will not be able to charge more than competitor, most likely less. Once you project revenues and unit sales, develop your cost of goods based upon sales projections (variable costs) and administrative (fixed) costs. Project the full slate of financial statements.\n\n\nContact vendors and other providers of relevant outputs in order to get price quotes on the goods and services required to implement your business plan.\nEstimate the costs related to hiring personnel, and purchasing the physical space and equipment required to implement your business idea.\nIf you can't afford to pay yourself you will need to ask yourself if your business idea is worth pursuing. Remember, the business's money is not your money and failure to understand/consider this fact is how many business people end up in hot water.",

Once you have determined the cost of implementation, you should next determine how much profit you would need to make in order to recover all costs associated with implementing your business proposal. This will allow you to determine how much you should charge for your product or service, and will allow you to begin to structure a timetable for when you will begin to recoup an actual profit.\n\n\nUse the total amount of estimated costs for implementation as the starting point for determining your profit forecast.\nThough the profits you make would ideally be greater than the costs of implementation, the reality is that most businesses fail before the first full year of operations. Thus breaking even over the first few years of operation would be a big success.\nA forecast for recouping implementation costs will strengthen your business proposal, especially when you are pursuing financing.",
                "Create a completed draft of your business proposal. A good business proposal should provide a succinct/detailed explanation of what your business idea is, your market research, potential marketing strategies, the cost of implementing the proposal and a pricing strategy. Divide your business plan into the following separate sections:[5]\n\nAn executive summary that concisely outlines your business plan. Communicate the ultimate purpose of your business proposal.\nMarket analysis for the industry your proposal is geared towards. Provide reasons for why your business proposal should be successful given both unique and specific market considerations.\nStrategy and implementation plans for executing your business proposal.\nFinancial plans and projections regarding the cost of implementing the business proposal, as well as possible profit projections if the business plan is a success.",
                "Consider your reader, and never assume they have relevant previous knowledge. Many good business ideas fail to gain support because the person reading the proposal didn't understand what they were reading. Explain everything in your proposal as if you were presenting it to someone with no previous knowledge in the field.",
                "Make sure your business proposal is purposefully presented. Useful graphs, illustrations of promotions, prototypes, etc., as well as a good, easy-to-read document layout will all make a good impression and look more professional. Consider getting your proposal professionally bound, and always print in color if you have charts and diagrams. Be prepared to give verbal presentations in support of your proposal.[6]",
                "Have the draft proposal independently reviewed. A fresh set of eyes will often pick up errors and omissions that a writer misses. Ask a business professional you trust to review your business plan for anything that they themselves would have included in the plan. After this review consider which suggestions such be integrated into your business proposal draft.[7]\n\nHaving a trusted business professional look at your business proposal draft could also lead to additional business mentoring/guidance and maybe even financial assistance for implementing your business plan."

        "How to Tell if Your Dog Is in Heat": {
            "intro": "Heat, which is also known as the Estrus period, is a reproductive stage that unspayed female dogs go through. During this stage her eggs mature, making her fertile and able to produce puppies. Your dog will have different behavioral and physical changes during this stage, due to hormonal changes in her body. These changes will allow you to figure out whether she is in heat or not.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the basic reproductive cycle of your dog. When wondering if your dog is in heat, it first helps to understand her normal hormonal cycle. When a female dog reaches maturity, and is physically ready to reproduce, her estrogen levels increase, initiating the release of eggs from her ovaries. If mating occurs during this period, the eggs can then be fertilized and an embryo can be produced.[1]\n\nFemale dogs, will generally go into heat during puberty, at around 6 to 24 months of age depending on breed. Smaller breeds generally come into heat earlier than larger breeds.",
                "Know when to check for signs of heat. In a year, a dog will usually go into heat twice with an average interval of six months in between each heat, depending on the breed.[2]\n\nThis can help you decide if it's likely she's in heat. For example, if she was in heat one month ago, it's unlikely she's in heat again so soon and something might be wrong.\nWhile most dogs come into heat twice a year, is every six months, as with any hormonal event some dogs are more regular than others. Some dogs come into heat as regular as clockwork every six months, whilst others are highly variable. A window of 4 - 8 months is considered normal.\nDogs are usually in heat for three to four weeks.",
                "Understand the signs of heat. The heat itself follows a pattern, with the vulva swelling and a bloody discharge in the first week. However, nature has a trick up her sleeve, because around days 7 - 14 the discharge may stop or become much lighter. This can trick the unwary owner into thinking season is over and their bitch is no longer at risk of pregnancy. However, nothing could be further from the truth. This middle week is actually when the dog ovulates, and is at the peak risk of falling pregnant.\n\n\nThis is also the week when she is most interested in finding a boyfriend, and so far from relaxing your vigilance, if you do not want the dog to have puppies you should tighten up on security.\nAround days 14 - 21 into the heat, the bloody discharge returns, but gradually lightens and dries up completely. However, the vulva often remains larger than normal for another couple of weeks (although she cannot get pregnant now her heat is over).",
                "Look for swelling of the vulva. Your dog’s vulva is located directly below her anus. Before your dog goes into heat, her vulva will start to swell slightly. When she is in full heat, her vulva will swell to three times its normal size and will take on a reddish color.[3]",
                "Notice any vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding is a sign that your dog will soon be going into heat. When your dog goes into heat, the amount of blood will decrease quite a bit and the blood will become brownish in color.\n\n\nIf a dog is scrupulously clean and licks away the discharge, it can be tricky to know if a discharge is present or not. A useful tip is to cover her bed with a white sheet or pillowcase. That way when she is asleep you will see blood spots on the white cover.\nIf you plan on breeding your dog, write down the day that the bleeding begins. Breeding is best done on the 10th or 11th day after the first day of bleeding and then every other day after that for three days.",
                "Notice whether your dog continuously licks herself. Another sign that your dog is entering heat, or in its early stages, is if she constantly licks her vagina. While some female dogs won’t do this, most dogs will develop this behavior right around the time that they go into heat.",
                "Take note if your dog starts acting strangely. dogs who are in the early stages of heat tend to develop behaviors that they do not typically display. In particular, female dogs who are about to go into heat are usually nervous, agitated, or easily irritated.[4]\n\nSome dogs will also bark more or become more aggressive with people and dogs around them.",
                "Pay attention to increased mating behaviors. If your female dog begins mounting male dogs or other dogs, she is more than likely in heat. Mounting is a common sign that a dog is in the full swing of heat. She may even try to mount your legs.\n\n\nHowever, dogs can mount legs or each other for behavioral reasons, such as masturbating, dominance, or bizarrely from submissive behavior, so this does not automatically mean a dog in heat.",
                "Watch for changes in the way your dog positions her tail. When a female dog enters heat, she will curl her tail to one side, making it easier for mating to occur. This action is called ‘flagging’ and is a common behavior of dog in heat.[5]\n\nYou may also elicit this behavior by giving her a vigorous scratch on her rump. If she stiffens her back legs and diverts her tail to one side she is flagging.\nNever insert anything into the dog's vulva or vagina to test out if she is ready. You can inadvertently cause harm to the delicate, inflamed tissues and cause huge distress to her.",
                "Know that some female dogs are ‘silent heaters’. These dogs do not display any noticeable signs of being in heat. They produce reproductive hormones but don't develop the more usual external signs such as a swollen vulva.\n\n\nThe only way you can really confirm if a silent heater is in heat is by observing the interactions between male dogs and the female dog in question. Male dogs will detect even low levels of female reproductive hormones, which will arouse their intense interest and attention.\nBe aware that some dogs do \"skip\" a heat. If they are unwell or their health is below par, or if they have lost weight recently, their body may save its energy and she won't come into heat when expected. This is nature's way of saying her body needs all its reserves to look after number one, rather than being in a state of flourishing good health where she could care for puppies.",
                "Pay attention to the levels of aggressiveness in male dogs. If you have a couple of male dogs, as well as your female dog who you think may be in heat, pay attention to how aggressive your male dogs are to one another. When more than one male dog is around a female in heat, they will begin to act very aggressively towards one another to prove who is dominant and should mate with the female dog.",
                "Notice an increase in verbal communication and agitation. If you own one male dog and a female dog that you think may be in heat, pay attention to how the male dog reacts to being kept apart from the female dog. If he seems more agitated than normal and whines frequently, he is most likely verbalizing his irritation and not being allowed near the female dog. This is a good indicator that your dog is in heat.\n\n\nAlthough this is not foolproof and you need to interpret this in the context of the dog's physical changes and the male dog's usual behavior when kept apart from his female pal. Some dogs experience anxiety when separated from a close playmate and this is difficult to differentiate from sexual frustration.",
                "Observe the interactions between your male dog and your female dog. If you let your dogs run around together all the time, then observe what happens when your male dog gets near your female dog. If your dog allows her vagina to be licked and sniffed for an extended period of time, she is most likely in heat. In particular, if she lets herself be mounted it is a sign that she is in heat.[6]\n\nHowever, allowing another dog to mount her, can also be a sign of submissive behavior, so once again, you need to interpret the whole picture and ask questions such as is her heat due and how does she normally behave around dogs. Remember, sniffing bottoms is something dogs like to do a lot, at the best of times, just to work out who is who!\nIf your male and female dogs don't normally interact, keep your male dog on a leash when you bring him near your female dog. One or both dogs may become aggressive if they are not familiar with each other.",
                "Have your veterinarian do a blood test to determine if your dog is in heat.[7] A test can be used that measures blood progesterone levels, which rise when the dog is in heat. This is simply done via a sample drawn from the bitch and sent to the lab. Low levels indicate she is not cycling, medium levels show she is in heat, and high levels indicate she is pregnant.\n\n\nThe alternative is a test used in research establishments. It measures the level of Luteinizing hormone (LH) in the bloodstream, which rises prior to ovulation. However, this is not commercially available as a test kit.",
                "Have your veterinarian do a Vaginal Cytology test. It is quick and easy to do.[8] The veterinarian rolls a clean cotton tip over the moist lining of the vulva and then rolls the cotton tip over a glass microscope slide. Once the smear is dry, it is stained and examined under the microscope.\n\n\nA dog in heat has a typical pattern of large, cornified cells plus red blood cells that are typical of being in heat. This along with physical signs is enough to decide if the dog is in heat.",
                "Ask yourself whether the symptoms you are seeing could be heat or if they suggest a health problem. This means it's important to use your common sense when wondering if the dog is in heat. If you are in any doubt, then take her to see your veterinarian. [9]\n\nIs the dog due to be in heat? If yes, then heat is more likely than a health problem.\nWas she recently in heat? If yes, then another heat is unlikely and there may be a health problem.\nIs she in good spirits, eating and drinking normally, and normally active? If yes, heat is more likely.\nIs she not quite herself, is her appetite is reduced, is she more thirsty than usual, or does she keep vomiting? If yes, a health problem is likely and urgent veterinary attention sought.",
                "Have your veterinarian take a look at your dog if she should not be in heat but is exhibiting similar symptoms. There is a health condition, pyometra, that affects older dogs which, to the untrained eye, could mimic being in heat. The overlapping symptoms include a swollen vulva, with or without a vaginal discharge. A pyometra refers to a womb infection. In severe cases the womb fills with pus and the dog becomes toxic when toxins from the bacteria are absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\n\nIf you have an older dog, who has recently been in heat (4 - 8 weeks before) and she develops a discharge, seek veterinary attention because this is the peak risk period for a pyometra developing.\nIn the early stages the dog may be more thirsty or lack a good appetite. As the condition becomes more serious, the toxins causes kidney damage, and left untreated, can be fatal.\nEach time the dog has a heat it weakens the lining of the womb slightly and makes a pyometra more likely. This condition mainly affects aging dogs (the more cycles she has, the more likely it is to happen) and no breed is exempt from being at risk."

        "wikiHow to Get Published": {
            "intro": "In today’s digital landscape, there is no one way to publish your work anymore. Maybe you are looking to publish a collection of short stories. Or you've finally finished a novel manuscript or a non fiction book. With enough persistence, you may finally see your manuscript in print or online.",
            "steps": [
                "Try traditional publishing. When you go the traditional publishing route, the publisher pays you for the right to publish your work. Traditional publishers assume all costs and pay the author an advance and royalties on all sales of the work.[1]\n\nTo get a traditional publisher, you will need to persuade a publisher to accept your work and offer you a contract.\nA traditional publisher takes on the financial risk of publishing the work. They can also offer you marketing and publicity expertise.\nGoing the traditional route gives you access to mainstream exposure. But it is competitive in the traditional publishing world. Sometimes successful DIY or self published authors can negotiate better deals without a publisher.",
                "Consider publishing through a partnership. In this option, the author partners with a literary agent, a publisher, or an author collective.[2]\n\nThe author does not have to pay a fee to the partner, but usually does not get an advance.\nAs well, the partner will need to select the author and be able to offer marketing savvy and industry expertise to the author.\nA partnership is beneficial because it is less risky than self publishing. The author also gets better royalties in a partnership. It also frees up the author from having to deal with the administrative side of publishing. This then gives the author more time to focus on creative work.\nNot all partners will offer the same thing to an author, so shop around. Always have a legal representative look over a partnership contract before signing it.\nExamples of partnership publishers includes: Rogue Reader, Diversion Books, and Cool Gus Publishing.",
                "Understand how to publish through a service provider. This means the author pays upfront for a package of services and the service provider only does the work the author pays for. As well, all work is usually accepted by the service provider, as long as the author can pay for the service.[3]\n\nUsually, an author can make more royalties if they go through a service provider. Examples of service providers include: Author Solutions, Infinity Publishing, and Outskirts Publishing.\nBut, you get what you pay for, so you may get a published product that does not have much commercial value. Your book may be available for order through bookstores, but rarely stocked on the shelves in the store.\nThese books are usually considered of lower quality in the publishing world. Most self published success stories do not originate from publishing through these service providers.",
                "Use a distributor. If you publish your work through a distributor, you will have to do the majority of the administrative work on your own. You will need to hire a book designer, find a good copy editor, and do all the administrative work. You would then provide the distributor with the final files of the book and they would proceed with the publication.[4]\n\nThe distributor may charge an upfront fee and/or take a cut of the sales, but they are responsible for paying the authors.\nUsing a distributor can also save you the headache of managing many retailers (or book sellers). The author is also not bound by a contract to the distributor, so they are not giving up their royalty rights.\nUse distribution service providers. Such as: Smashwords (e-books), BabyBook (e-books), eBookPartnership.com, and Blurb (full color books).",
                "Weigh the pros and cons of self publishing. Self publishing, or DIY direct, means the author does all the work on their own. They then hire any outside help like a book designer or an editor. Self publishers will also need to provide retailers (book sellers) with finished, ready to go files or books.[5]\n\nKeep in mind the retailer will take a cut of the sales, but the author is not exclusive to a publisher. This means the author can deal with each retailer on an individual basis.\nSelf publishing allows the author to maximize their earnings from the sale of the books. This also allows the author to get the highest percentage of sales. The author retains complete freedom over the work so they can adjust or edit it on the fly, and can control the pricing of the book.\nBut, self publishing can become a full time job if the author is aiming for high profit and high quality. As well, Amazon and Apple need you to be exclusive to them if you are going to use their services to self publish.",
                "Prepare a polished manuscript if you are writing a novel or a memoir. Before you look for a publisher or an agent, make sure you have a final manuscript to shop around. It is rare for first time authors without a strong publishing track record to sell a novel or memoir based on an idea or proposal.[6]\n\nMany writers have great story ideas or a partial manuscript. But it almost never a good idea to pitch your work to a publishing professional when your manuscript is still at an early stage.\nSeek out a writing critique group or mentor who can offer constructive feedback to help you revise and edit your work.\nIts important to be confident and happy with the final manuscript before you submit it for publication. So don’t rush into publishing your work until you feel it is at its best state.",
                "Complete a book proposal if you are working on a nonfiction manuscript. This will help to convince a publisher to contract you to write the book.[7]\n\nTo create a book proposal, research the market for your idea. Build a business case for why your book will sell and why you are the best person to write it.\nResearch other comparable titles or writers who examine the same topic or issue. Make sure your take on the material is unique but doesn’t break all the rules of the genre. Avoid confusing the potential audience for the book.",
                "Research the traditional publishing market. Familiarize yourself with the Big Five publishers, as well as mid-size and small presses. Look up the titles listed on the websites for these publishers to get a sense of the type of writing and content they publish.[8]\n\nThe Big Five are the major book publishers in the United States. They are: Penguin, HarperCollins, Hachette, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster. All five publishers have their headquarters in New York City.[9]\n\nMid size publishers like Tin House[10] and Graywolf Press[11] are great smaller publishers.\nAnother great resource is PublishersMarketplace.com, which announces upcoming book deals. This resource can also help you get a sense of what the current landscape of commercial publishing looks like.",
                "Consider the commercial viability of your book. Commercial viability means how valuable your book may be to certain audiences. Some books are “big” books that work well for the Big Five traditional publishers. Other books are “quiet” books that work well for mid-size and small presses. Its important to remember that not every book is a good fit for a New York publisher. To find the right fit for your work, you need to be honest about your work’s potential.[12]\n\nThe Big Five usually publish genre writing. Such as: romance, mystery/crime, thriller, fiction, fantasy, and young adult.\nUsually, a New York publisher will only sign a nonfiction book if they expect to sell at least 10,000-20,000 copies.\nThe Big Five may have a harder time selling books like exceed 120,000 words, depending on the genre. They also rarely publish poetry, short stories or essay collections. Unless the author is a known writer or has a solid audience base.\nThe Big Five also might not accept memoirs with common story lines that do not have a unique angle to the story. They also may not be as open to literary and experimental fiction.\nIf your work doesn’t seem like a good candidate for a New York house, don’t despair. There are many mid-size publishers and small presses that might show interest in your work.",
                "Decide if you need a literary agent. In today’s market, literary agents sell about 80 percent of the books acquired by New York publishers. These agents act as experts in the publishing industry and have inside contacts with specific editors.[13]\n\nThey also know better than writers what an editor or publisher would be most likely to show interest in or buy. If you want to publish with one of the major New York houses, you will likely need an agent.\nAn agent should negotiate the best deal for you and ensure you get paid. They should also be the go between you and the publishers. The best agents are career advisers and managers. Usually, agents only get paid when they sell your work. They receive a 15% commission on your advance and your royalties.\nWhen looking for an agent, it's a good idea to make a long list of possible agents. Rank the agents based on the ones you want to work with the most and the ones you would settle for. To find a list of literary agents, look at Writers Market[14], Publishers Marketplace[15], and Agent Query.[16][17]\n\nAvoid agents who charge fees. Agents take on clients based on the size of the advance they think the publishers might offer for a book.\nIf you are writing for a niche market (e.g. soccer moms, vintage cars) or have an academic or literary work, you may not need an agent. As well, if your work does not command a sizable advance, at least 5 figures, you may not be worth the agent’s time.",
                "Prepare your submission to the publisher. The most common materials you will need are:\n\n\nA query letter: a 1-page pitch letter that gives a brief description of your work.\nA novel synopsis: a brief summary, usually no more than 1-2 pages of your story, from beginning to end. If it is a synopsis of a novel, it must reveal the ending.[18]\n\nNonfiction book proposal: usually rather long, complex documents, about 20-30 pages.[19]\n\nA novel proposal: this usually refers to your query letter, a synopsis, and perhaps a first chapter. Keep in mind there is not an industry standard definition of a “novel proposal”. The publisher should explain their expectations of a novel proposal.\nSample chapters: send sample chapters from the beginning of your novel or memoir. Don’t select a middle chapter, even if you think its your best. For nonfiction, usually any chapter is acceptable.",
                "Work hard on your query letter. The query letter is a time-honored tool for writers seeking publication. It is like a sales letter that tries to persuade an editor or agent to request a full manuscript or proposal. You need to seduce the editor or agent into loving your work through a well written query letter. Make sure your query letter includes:[20]\n\nPersonalization: customize the letter for the recipient. If you are sending a letter to a big New York publisher, you should be formal and use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.\nWhat you’re selling: explain the genre/category of your work, give a work count, and the title of the work.\nA hook: what will keep the editor or agent engaged in the letter, and by extension, your work? Keep the hook 100-200 words long for a novel query. Introduce the protagonist, their conflict and the stakes of the story (or the choices the protagonist has to make). Always include a detail that will get your reader to care about the story enough to request a manuscript.\nYour bio: this is sometimes optional for uncredited fiction writers. Keep it short and sweet.\nA thank you and closing statement.\nThe blog Query Shark, run by literary agent Janet Reid, offers feedback and critiques on query letters. It also has an archive of over 200 real query letters. Look at examples to get a sense of query letters that work and letters that miss the mark.[21]",
                "Gauge the responses to your query letters. You will likely get one of three responses back:[22]\n\nNo response at all: usually means a rejection from the editor or agent. But you can re-send the query letter just to be sure. If you receive no requests from any editors or agents for more pages of your work, you may need to revise your query letter.\nA request for a partial manuscript and maybe a synopsis.\nA request for the full manuscript. If you get a rejection once the editor or agent reads more pages, there may be issues in your manuscript or proposal.",
                "Keep querying and don’t give up. Some authors get rejected hundreds of times before they finally get a request for more material or sign on to a publisher. So, if you have put years of time and effort into a project, don’t abandon it after the first rejection.[23]\n\nInstead, look at your rejection slips for patterns about what’s not working. Rejections can work as lessons to improve your writing. Getting rejected can also help you reconsider the editors and publishers you are querying.\nKeep in mind some manuscripts need time to develop. There may not be a market for the story or there may not be a way to revise the work to make it more successful.\nMost authors don’t sell their first manuscript. But they might sell their second, third, or fourth manuscript. Every manuscript, and every draft you write, can only make you a better writer.[24]",
                "Determine if your genre has a big online audience. E-books are becoming a popular option for writers tired of rejection who still want to see their work published. But e-books are just that: books published on an online platform. So the author will not be able to hold a physical copy of the book in their hands or see a physical copy of the book in a bookstore.[25]\n\nSome genres, like thriller, romance, or erotica, have a large online audience of readers. Check if it is common for authors in your genre to release e-books. If digital only publishers exist in your genre, this is a good sign there are online readers for your genre.\nAn author who is successful at self-publishing should have an entrepreneurial spirit. They should also have an active online presence and an established author website.\nUnlike traditional publishing, self publishing sales will snowball or grow over time. So it’s important to be patient and be willing to promote your work online all the time.",
                "Keep in mind e-publishing retailers and distributors are not publishers. This means e-publishers take no responsibility for the quality of your work, but they also do not own any rights to your work.\n\n\nIf a traditional publisher shows interest after you have published as an e-book, you can still sell the rights to your work.\nThis also means you have to find an audience for your work on your own. You are also responsible for all aspects of publishing a book, from editing to design to marketing.",
                "Upload the completed manuscript as a PDF to the distributor’s site. Most distributors will offer easy to use options to customize the look of your book, from font size to cover art. You can also create your own cover art in Photoshop.[26]\n\nThe self publisher will send you a book proof within a few weeks.\nEven after you publish the book, you can make changes to the cover and the text by submitting new PDFs to the distributor. Most distributors charge a fee of $25-$50 for uploading a new cover or new interior.",
                "Don’t expect fast or easy money in self-publishing. Though the e-publishing process may take no more than a few days to complete, you likely won't earn a lot of money on sales. There is a continual stream of new self published titles available online every day, many of which are low quality.[27]\n\nIn fact, the average self published book sells about 100-150 copies.",
                "Promote your work and maintain an active online presence. Now that you’re a published author online, it’s important you promote your work as much as possible. Write posts about your book on forums, on social media, and on your blog.\n\n\nRemember, you will have to act as your own marketing guru. You will need to commit to growing your readership and drawing attention to your work.",
                "Be professional and polite to agents, editors, and publishers. Never call an agent or editor to query or ask questions if you are not one of their clients. You need to earn a spot on their radar through a great query letter and quality work.[28]\n\nAs well, do not visit them at their offices in New York or go knocking on doors. Agents, editors, and publishers could consider this unprofessional or rude.\nIts important to remember publishing is a business, like Hollywood or Broadway. The publishing industry will support authors and work that will make money and provide a good return on investment. In the current age, this return investment needs to happen fast, usually with one book and in less than one year.",
                "Be aware of the difficulties of publishing a hybrid work. A hybrid work combines several genres or styles of writing like essays, stories, and poetry. But it can be difficult to get a hybrid work published in the traditional way, as it does not fall into a single, salable category.[29]\n\nIn fact, even novelists and memoirists often get more rejections than acceptances. But it’s important to persevere and not be too discouraged by rejection.",
                "Attend writers conferences. These conferences are a great way to meet editors and agents in a professional setting. You can also determine which publishers might be a good fit for your work.[30]\n\nDo some research before attending a conference. Select a conference that allows you to meet with a specific author, editor, or agent that is ideal for your work.\nDiscuss the possibility of a critique session with the chosen editor. Make an appointment with them to discuss your work.\nAttending writers conferences shows you want to be part of the writing community. It also shows you are not afraid to put yourself out there to promote your work. You’ll be far more attractive to publishers if they believe you’ll be an active marketer and promoter of your book.",
                "Create quality work and keep writing. The quality of your writing matters more than a perfect query letter or the right cover design.[31]\n\nRead other authors who relate to your work. Continue to practice your craft through many drafts and redrafts.\nYour writing can only get better with time. Once you achieve quality in your work, your letter of acceptance from an agent or publisher will likely follow."

        "wikiHow to Create Tree Flower Beds": {
            "intro": "When you are planting a garden around your tree, protect your tree by following some simple guidelines about outlining the area for your bed, applying topsoil, and avoiding the tree roots when planting. Then select plants that are compatible with your geographical region and the specific shade requirements of your garden plot. Lastly, learn how to plant your bed and maintain the plants with regular watering and care.",
            "steps": [
                "Grow plants that are sun or shade compatible with your planting area. You first need to know how much sun exposure your bed receives. Observe your garden over the course of a day, and consider how your shade and sunlight levels will change in the different seasons. When buying plants, the descriptions will indicate how much sun they will need.\n\n\nFull sun means that during the middle of the day in the growing season the area will get six or more hours of direct sunlight. If this is the case for your bed, you will have a wide range of plants you can choose from.\nPartial sun means that the area receives direct sunlight from the sunrise until noon. The reason this is not full sun is because the sun in the morning is not as strong as sun in the middle of the day. [1]\n\nPartial shade is when your spot receives sunlight from 3 p.m. until the end of the day. Partial shade also applies to areas that have dappled or filtered sunshine for the full day.\nFull shade would mean that the area is on the north side of a building or that the tree coverage is very dense and that even dappled sunshine does not show through. Although your options will be fewer, you can still find suitable, attractive plants for your bed.",
                "Pay attention to the mature size of the plant. Make sure that when the plant is full size that it will fit well under the tree and in the space you have. [2] Buy small and low growing plants for your bed. Plants that will get tall may start to block sunlight for any smaller plants in the bed or encroach on the lower branches of tree.",
                "Choose the flowers to plant under your tree. Planting flowers under your tree can make for a very attractive bed. Consider planting in a cluster of 3-5 different kinds of flowers or shrubs to create a more textured or flourishing look. Consider the zone where you are planting as well. When you buy plants, make sure they are suited for your region. For example, if you live in the desert, there are many flowers that are difficult to successfully grow in the summer because of the heat.[3]:",
                "Choose a shrub to plant under your tree. These plants are easy to maintain and can add great variety to your bed. You will want to make sure that whatever shrub you buy is low growing. Once again, consider the sunlight and region where you live when you are selecting your plants. Shrubs are great for growing under trees because they can thrive with less light and/or moisture.[4]",
                "Know when to plant. You should plant any flower other than a pansy after the last frost of the spring. Pansies are heartier and can withstand the cold. Other flowers will die if you plant them and a frost comes.[5] Find the average last frost date from the previous year. Search online at plantmap.com for the last frost in your area. You can also use the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to obtain data on the last frost date in your location. [6][7]\n\nCertain plants will thrive best if they are planted during a specific time or at certain temperatures, so pay attention to the care instructions for your plant. For example, irises grow best if you plant them in the late summer or early fall instead of in the spring. [8] You can go to www.garden.org to read more about how to care for your specific plant. [9]\n\nNote when you are buying your plants that annuals will grow just one season and perennials will last at least two seasons.",
                "Set a perimeter for your bed. You don’t need to create a border; however, you should know where the perimeter of your bed is to know where to plant. Take a shovel and mark off the diameter of the bed. Remember that you should start planting a foot out from the trunk of the tree, so 24 inches may be a good place to make a perimeter.",
                "Build a raised bed around your tree. Do not dig up the soil around your tree because you may end up digging up the roots with the soil. Instead, create a bed of soil around your tree. You can just dump soil around the tree to create the bed, or you can use bricks or logs as a border for the outer edges of the soil.\n\nMake sure to make the soil bed around the tree deep enough for your plants to fit into.",
                "Take the plant carefully out of its container. If it is a small pack with several flowers, push up from the bottom and lift the plant out from the roots. Untangle any roots that are stuck to the bottom of the container. If it is a potted plant, place your hand over the surface of the soil, and turn the plant over into the palm of your hand.",
                "Loosen the roots of the plant. Take the outside of the root ball, and gently untangle some of the roots at the edge of the root ball. You do not want the roots to remain a dense mass, and untangling them a bit will allow the roots to plant more easily into the new soil. [10]",
                "Place the plant in the hole, and cover it with soil. Gently put the plant into the new soil, and take your new topsoil and cover the flower roots. Then press down on the soil around the base of the flower with your hands. Now your plant is almost set- repeat the above steps to plant the rest of your shrubs and flowers before you water.\n\n\nHold the plant by the roots rather than by the stems at all times.",
                "Leave your plants room to grow, and weed your flower bed regularly. When you are planting, do not plant the flowers or shrubs too close together. Find out how big the plants are going to grow, and consider how densely you want the area to be populated with plants. Leave at least 2-3 inches of space between each plant. In addition, you should maintain your flower bed by weeding regularly. Use your hands and pluck out any unwanted plants that are growing around your flowers and plants by the root. If weeds are left unattended they can choke your flowers and take their nutrients.\n\n\nMake a schedule on your calendar for when you should be weeding your flower bed to help keep you on track with your weeding.",
                "Water the area where you have planted your flowers thoroughly. Water consistently after you have planted your plants. When the plants roots have to compete with the roots of a tree they will need more water. Set a watering schedule for your plants to help you keep track of when you have watered them and when you will need to water them again.",
                "Every year add another inch of organic matter to your garden. [11] You can add organic matter or more topsoil to your garden that is suited for your kinds of flowers, perennial or annual. You need to add organic matter because the bacteria and fungi in organic matter is food for your plants. You can make your own organic matter for your garden by composting. Using your vegetable scraps, garden clippings, leaves or manure, you can provide the nutrients your plants need to thrive year after year.",
                "Leave about an inch between the base of the tree and any mulch.[12] Place the mulch about 1 inch from the base of the tree and start planting about 12 inches from the tree’s trunk. Plant outwards from there. Make sure that where the trunk becomes wider and the roots are exposed that the bark remains uncovered. Do not create a raised flower bed around the tree base. The bark on the exposed roots of a tree needs oxygen, and if the roots are covered they will rot over time.[13]",
                "Trim the low branches of your tree. [14] You want to allow as much light as you can to reach the flowers and plants below your tree. So get out a pair of trimming shears and trim any low, thin branches. Remember, however, that living branches should be on at least ⅔ of the plant’s height, so never trim more than ⅓ of the living branches of your tree. [15]\n\nYou can get pruning shears at a hardware store.[16]\n\nOnly remove branches that are less than 5 cm in diameter.\nTrim thin V-shaped branches. Avoid trimming healthy U-shaped branches.\nIf you are pruning a small branch, trim it about 1/4 inch out from a bud. If you are pruning a larger branch, then cut it just outside the raised collar area outside of the trunk.[17]",
                "Know what kind of tree you are planting under. Depending on the kind of tree you are planting under, you should be more careful about how many plants you plant. You may want to plant under a tree that is better suited for gardening at its base. If you do have a tree that is more sensitive, consider starting small and choose a few small plants rather than creating a dense garden at the base of the tree. If you have a tree that is sensitive, create a plan for your garden that will span a few years, so your tree can gradually acclimate to the new planting. [18]\n\nBe cautious when planting under these trees because they are sensitive about having their roots disturbed:\n\nBeeches\nBlack oak\nBuckeyes\nCherries and plums\nDogwoods\nHemlocks\nLarches\nLindens\nMagnolias\nPines\nRed oaks\nScarlet oaks\nSugar maples"

        "wikiHow to Tune a Ski": {
            "intro": "Skis wear down fast if you use them frequently, and need to be edged and waxed so you can \"bite\" the snow to turn but still glide smoothly forward. While ski shops offer high quality tuning services, serious skiing hobbyists may want to learn the process themselves so they can save money and make personalized adjustments.",
            "steps": [
                "Bring the skis in out of the cold. After a long day of skiing, you will want to bring your skis inside to raise them to room temperature. If you proceed to wax a ski while it is still cold, there's a chance that you will bubble the base and create a lot more work for yourself.\n\n\nYou can get started on the edging while waiting for your skis to warm up.",
                "Secure the skis. Clamp the skis securely to a vise at a comfortable work height, on their side with the top of the ski facing you. If you don't have a a vise, place two chairs facing each other and weigh them down with heavy objects on their seats to make them stable. Lay the skis across the top of the seat backs, and fasten them securely with bungee cords. Make sure the skis are completely stable before you continue.\n\n\nYou can put small pieces of cardboard between the skis and the vise clamps to prevent scratching.",
                "Tie brakes out of the way. Use brake retainer bands or large, thick rubber bands to pull the ski brakes up and out of the way of the ski edges.",
                "Consider the base edge. This is the edge between the base of the ski and the side. For most purposes and ski models, this should be at a 1º angle. While you can sharpen this edge in the same way as the side edge, described below, there is a higher risk of damaging the skis by scratching the ski base. If the base edge has become dull or in need of reshaping, getting this done at a ski shop is recommended. If you do this yourself, sharpen the base edge before you sharpen the side edge, using the same tools and process described below.",
                "Remove burrs from the side edge. Run your finger along the side edge of your skis, between the upper surface and the side. If you feel irregular nicks or rough patches, of if you see rust along the edge, file those areas down with a wet diamond stone, gummy stone, or bastard file. Hold the tool flat against the edge and push in long strokes over the rough patch, in one direction only. Repeat until the edge is mostly smooth.\n\n\nIf your edges are already sharpened, don't run your finger along them, or you could cut yourself. Wear gloves or just use the stone a few times without testing.",
                "Sharpen and shape the side edge. For the average skier, this should be done roughly once every seven ski days, or whenever it feels like turning has become more difficult. You can get this done at a ski shop, or do it yourself:\n\n\nPurchase a special ski file from a ski shop, along with a side edger that holds the file at a 1º angle (or a 1.5º or 2º angle if recommended by the ski manufacturer).\nIf you haven't done this before, use a black felt tip marker to draw a line along the edge. This is a useful guide for beginners: file away this line, but no further, and you should get a sharp edge without overdoing it.\nPlace the file against the side edge of the ski. Hold the side edger vertically, so the file will press against the edge at the required angle. Push the file into the ski edge at constant pressure to keep it flat, then push along the length of the ski in long strokes. Repeat, pushing the file in one direction only, until the entire length of the skis has been filed about 20 times.\nYou can file tip to tail or tail to tip, as long as you stick to one direction.\nTest how sharp your edges are by using them to scrape off a bit of your fingernail. The less pressure you use, the sharper your edge.",
                "Adjust the skis. Reposition the skis so the base is horizontal and facing upward, in preparation for waxing.",
                "Clean off old wax and dust. Rub the base and edges of the skis down with a rag or soft-bristled brush to remove dust and debris. If there is a great deal of crumbling old wax, use a base cleaner or wax solvent from a ski shop.",
                "Repair gouges if necessary. If the base of your skis has noticeable gouges, you'll need P-tex candles to repair them. Gouges that expose the metal beneath may need more serious repairs from a ski shop. These candles burn very hot, so wear heat-proof gloves and remove all flammable materials from the area before you begin.\n\n\nHold the P-tex candle over the gouge and light the end of the candle with a lighter.\nDrip the P-tex wax into the gouge until it is filled, or touch it to the gouge for more accurate filling. Take care not to spill this anywhere else, as the wax can be tough to scrape off.\nLet the wax cool for at least an hour, then scrape it flat using a wax scraper (see the end of this section for more information on scraping.)",
                "Select a ski wax based on temperature. Different waxes are suitable for snow at different temperatures, so check the forecast for the location where you'll be skiing next. Typically, a cold weather wax is suitable for temperatures under 20ºF (-7º C), medium wax is best for conditions between 20 and 32ºF (-7º to 0ºC), and warm weather wax should be used in temperatures above 32ºF (0ºC).\n\n\nIt's better to err on the cold side. If you use a wax for too warm a temperature, your skis will become sticky and won't glide nearly as well on the snow.",
                "Warm up the skis with an iron. A waxing iron, which has no holes in the base, does a much better job than a regular clothes iron. If you do use a regular clothes iron, you will not be able to use it for clothes again, and there is a higher risk of damaging your skis. Set the iron to the minimum temperature setting and give it a few minutes to warm up. Once it's warm, run it along the ski base once or twice to warm up the ski.",
                "Drip wax onto the warm skis. Hold the bar of wax against your iron to drip a generous amount of wax onto the ski base, moving in a zig zag pattern.\n\n\nStop if your wax smokes, and unplug the iron for a few minutes to cool it down.",
                "Iron the wax onto the ski. Push the iron over the wax in long, steady strokes, moving lengthwise along the skis. Always keep the iron moving, as even a couple seconds in the same spot can burn your ski base and ruin it. Repeat until the wax has melted into one smooth surface.",
                "Let the wax cool. Wait at least one hour for the wax to cool. For best results, leave the skis overnight.",
                "Select a scraper. A hard plastic ski scraper works well, and is the safest option for beginners, since there is little risk of damaging the skis. A metal scraper or even a wide razor blade will work, but can easily scratch the ski base if you aren't careful.",
                "Scrape off excess wax. Once the wax has cooled, it's time to scrape the wax down to a thinner, flatter surface. This can take significant time and effort for beginners, but it will greatly improve the ski's performance on powdery snow.\n\n\nHold the scraper with both hands and start at the tip of the groove, holding the scraper at a 45º angle to the base. Starting at the groove ensures that a slip will only nick the wax on the base, not the base itself.\nPull the scraper firmly toward you, along the length of the groove. Flakes of wax should come off as you do this. Repeat until very little wax comes off.\nRepeat for the rest of the base, scraping off excess wax with even pressure. While you can remove all the wax, leaving a thin layer on the skis will help the surface last longer before it needs retuning.",
                "Detune the tips and tails (optional). This is a somewhat controversial step that comes down to personal preference. It may make your skis glide more smoothly, but try them out without this step before you make the change. If you do decide to detune the tips and tails, place a regular sharpening stone against the 2–3 inch (5–7.5 cm) section past the \"shovel\" or \"tail\" where the ski swoops up. Run it vertically along this section of the edge, dulling it enough that you can see a light's reflection on the edge. Repeat for all edge sections near the tips and tails.\n\n\nThis will also reduce the chance of cutting yourself on the ski edge if you hold it by the end.",
                "Brush the wax (optional). Restoring a little texture to the ski may improve performance. If you expect icy or hard-packed conditions, a horsehair brush or copper brush works well. If you expect soft snow or just want to brush off irregularities in the wax, use a nylon brush instead. Either way, brush along the base of the ski a few times to make shallow, visible streaks."

        "How to Train Clematis": {
            "intro": "Clematis is a plant that can be actively trained to grow somewhere that you want it to grow. It is known as “the queen of climbers” in the garden world for its ability to add color to plain structures likes walls and fences by growing upward as a 10 to 20 foot vine. The act of growing your own clematis can seem intimidating, but with proper care and training, you can have the clematis vine of your garden dreams.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a planting location for the clematis. For optimal growth, clematis need six hours of sun each day so a sunny location is necessary. You’ll get the best results if you keep the roots in shade and the foliage in sun - you can do this by using mulch, planting a low bush in front of it, or setting rocks on the soil around the plant.[1] As for its roots, clematis prefer well-drained, moist soil with a pH that is neutral to slightly alkaline.[2]\n\nPrep soil that is more on the acidic side by periodically “sweetening” it with wood ash or a little limestone.[3]",
                "Purchase building support for your clematis. Clematis are climbing plants that naturally grow upward instead of growing out like most traditional plants. In order to grow upward at its maximum height, they need support to facilitate their growth.[4]\n\nBird netting offers a nearly visible means of climbing support to clematis plants. Attach it to something in your garden with a staple or a fastener to prevent it from collapse over the years of the clematis plant’s growth.[5]\n\nConsider installing garden structures, like arbors or pergolas, which offer beauty and regality to your garden while providing support for clematis to scale. Add some bird wire between the ground and the first rung of the arbor to help young clematis grab and climb up more easily.[6]\n\nAllow them to climb on a rock wall in your yard by planting them near there. Purchase some wire to help them gain access to being able to scale the wall over time.[7]\n\nA trellis is also a common choice to place in gardens and are often inexpensive, little hassle options for helping the clematis climb. Adding some netting over the trellis can make it even easier for the clematis to hold on.",
                "Select the right clematis for your garden. If you have the room, cultivars that grow to be 10-20 feet vines might be what you’re looking for. For smaller gardens or potted plants, a more compact variety of clematis might be your preference. Standard clematis flowers blossom with a measurement of 5-6 inches across.[8]\n\nClematis flowers come in smaller blossoms and larger blossoms in different colors like white, wine red, lavender, deep purple, and even yellow.[9]\n\nBecause the growth of the vine can take years to reach maturity, it is advised to purchase a clematis that is at least two years in age to shorten the wait. Look for a container-grown plant that’s in a quart or gallon-size pot and robust in growth.[10]",
                "Prepare a hole to plant the clematis. Use the pot of the plant’s size to determine the size of the hole you’re digging. The hole needs to be approximately 18 inches wide and 18 inches deep.[11]\n\nPosition the hole near the center of the climbing fence or wall to give the clematis something to grow up against.\nIf you notice that the ground has poor drainage, consider making a larger hole for the plant.[12]",
                "Mix top soil from the hole with compost and a good organic fertilizer. Line the hole generously with some backfill of the mixture. Replenishing areas of the soil with fertilizer and compost moisture helps facilitate the growth of clematis by giving them cool soil to grow within.[13]",
                "Prepare the clematis for planting. As with planting any plant, watering it before the actual planting is imperative. It’s especially crucial with clematis plants because they need a lot of water to grow and to keep cool. Prep it for planting by watering it deeply.",
                "Remove the clematis plant from the pot. Push up on the bottom of the pot and slide the clematis plant out sideways into your free hand. Avoid pulling on the training stake in the pot or the clematis’s vine to remove it from the pot.[14]\n\nIf you find yourself having a hard time with sliding the plant out, roll it gently one half turn on the ground while lightly pushing it down to loosen up the sides.[15]\n\nBe gentle with the roots of the clematis. Most of them will be at the lower half of the flower pot. If you must, tease the roots away from the sides, but do so gently.",
                "Examine the soil line of the plant and ground. Place the clematis in the hole, situating it at about two inches lower than the ground. It is important that the roots stay cool. Fill the remainder of the hole and the area on top of the pot’s soil line with the compost, fertilizer, soil mixture.[16]",
                "Water the clematis thoroughly. If some vines are left exposed by settling soil, cover the areas with some more of the extra soil mixture. Mulch the clematis carefully after the filling and watering of the plant is completed.[17]\n\nMulch helps soil retain moisture which is important for clematis plants. Use mulch, stone, or pine bark to help soil keep its moisture. Keep the mulch a few inches away from the base of the vines themselves.\nWater new clematis plants regularly in their first growing season so that their growth is off to a successful start.[18] As much as four watering cans per square meter may be required to water the plants appropriately.[19]",
                "Be sure that the clematis will have something to climb on. Clematis plants climb by wrapping their leaf stems around the base of something. Clematis can successfully climb onto base supports made of wire, thin branches, steel rods, wooden dowels, fishing line, or twine.[20]\n\nMake sure that whatever surface you choose to use isn’t too wide for the leaf stems to twist around. The diameter should not be more than half an inch wide in diameter.[21]",
                "Grow clematis plants up the length of a brick wall with vine eyes. Vine eyes are large metal screws with circular endings that are driven or screwed into brickwork or masonry to create support for a wall. Wire lattice is threaded between them and pulled tightly after the vine eyes are screwed in.[22]\n\nTie the stems of the growing plant to the wire support. This can be done by incorporating metal wire, string, and paper covered twist ties.[23]\n\nCheck on the ties regularly to make sure that they are not too tight around the delicate growing stems. Loosen them and adjust them as needed.[24]",
                "Display clematis in your garden by training them against screens and pergolas. Make sure that the site is not too affected by wind and rain so that a variety of different clematis plants can be grown. Prevent premature rotting in wood areas by treating the bottom of the structure on the ground with a wood preservative.[25]",
                "Train clematis plants up along arches. For full coverage, use two clematis plants on either side to create full coverage.[26] Consider using scented clematis plants in those locations to greet passerby with sweet-smelling fragrance.[27]"

You do not need to have a specific child in mind to complete this form.",
                "Contact the USCIS or a state-licensed adoption agency to request a home study. Home studies must be performed in order to determine the fitness of you and the home environment you intend to bring a child into. They involve an in-person interview as well as numerous statements and evaluations, covering a range of topics from financial circumstances to criminal record.\n\n\nThe USCIS also runs your fingerprint through the FBI to make sure that you have a clean legal record.",
                "File your completed Form I-600A and the results of your home study with the USCIS. The base filing fee is $720, but additional fees may apply depending on other factors, such as how many adults you have living in your household.",
                "Make sure that you qualify to adopt according to Russian law. While the requirements for adoptive parents may seem relatively minor in comparison to many international countries, they are strictly enforced.\n\n\nBoth married couples and singles can adopt, but single parents must be at least 16 years older than the adoptive child. Some regions also insist that adoptive parents must not be more than 45 years older than the adoptive child.\nConsult your adoption agency if you have any medical conditions or take any prescription medications. Russian adoption law does restrict international adoption by individuals with various medical problems, and some conditions may preclude you from eligibility. This is especially true of mental health problems.",
                "Know what to expect concerning adoptable children.\n\n\nRussian law demands that orphaned children must be placed on the adoption registry for six months without being adopted by a Russian family before that child is eligible for international adoption.\nRussian children must be 8 months old or older before going up for international adoption. If you want to adopt a baby, your Russian paperwork must state that you are willing to adopt a child between 0-4 years old. Most Russian children adopted internationally fall within this age range.\nYou also have the option of adopting a group of siblings instead of a single child.",

You must have these documents prepared and translated into Russian in time for your date at adoption court. The documents include a home study, USCIS approval notice, copies of your passport, marriage certificate, police certificate, medical examination report, evidence of your place of residence, and several financial documents.\n\n\nThese documents should also be authenticated by the U.S. Department of State Authentications Office.",

This form must be completed after you have a specific child in mind, however; it cannot be done at the start of the process, as Form I-600A can be.",
                "Obtain a Russian passport for your child. Since your child is still a citizen of Russia at the time of adoption, he or she must have a Russian passport to travel to the U.S. The adoptive parents must submit an application for their child along with two identical photos of the child, a prepaid return envelop, and a $100 money order made payable to the Embassy of Russia to the Russian Consulate.",

                "Determine the finished size you want. The size of your blanket will depend on the purpose and the recipient.

                "Select your yarn. The size and thickness of your blanket, as well as your crocheting skill, can help you choose a type of yarn. If you're just beginning to crochet, choose a yarn with a smooth texture, a light color (so you can see your stitches clearly) and worsted (medium) weight.\n\nCount on needing 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket or a receiving blanket. Double that estimation for a larger blanket.\nIf you are at all unsure about whether you have enough yarn for the project at hand, get an extra skein or two.\nIf you're buying yarn that's produced in a dye lot, make sure each skein has the same dye lot number on the label. Otherwise, your skeins might be slightly different colors.",
                "Choose a hook size. Crochet hooks range in size from B (2.25mm) to S (19mm). Here's what to keep in mind when you're selecting a hook:\n\nThe bigger the hook, the bigger the stitch. Bigger stitches are easier to see, and they mean you'll get through the blanket faster. However, you'll also use up more yarn.\nBigger stitches are also looser, and make for more lightweight blankets. If you want a particularly warm blanket, choose a smaller hook for tighter stitches.\nIf you're just starting to crochet, choose a hook that's size N or bigger. You can work your way up to smaller hooks as you get more comfortable with crocheting.",

Hint: Make the number of stitches in your chain divisible by 5 or 10. It makes it easier to keep track of whether you're inadvertently increasing or decreasing each round. Know how many \"extra\" chains you'll need. Depending on the type of stitch you plan to use, you'll have a certain number of stitches that become part of the \"turn\" when you move on to the second row. For a single crochet, it's one chain; for a double crochet, it's three.",

You can count your stitches as you go, or you can periodically stop and count up the stitches on the row you just finished. Dress it up (optional). Crocheting only into the far side of each loop (instead of through both loops) gives a nice ridged appearance to the finished crochet.",

            "intro": "Fundraising dinners are a tried and true way to raise money for your cause, whether you’re a church, school, non-profit, or political candidate. While the size and expense may differ from event to event, the fundamentals remain the same. To get the most out of your event, you’ll need to plan carefully, advertise intelligently, be prepared to troubleshoot, and make sure to capitalize on the momentum generated by your event.",
            "steps": [
                "Set your goal. Decide how much you want to raise, i.e. your net gain after expenses are deducted.[1] Linking your goal directly to a clear objective will make it easier to get people to attend. Perhaps you’re raising money to cover the cost of a new roof for your coop nursery school, or to send a missionary to China. Don’t just raise money. Raise it for a reason.\n\n\nFirst, decide the specific thing you are trying to accomplish, then analyze how much it will cost. If raising money for a new roof, for instance, you would want to cost the project with contractors. If raising money to help cover general costs at a nursery school, you would want to know total costs (last year’s, plus expected additional costs for the coming year) and total expected revenue (tuition) in order to set a goal.\nGoals should be specific, measurable, and achievable.[2] The last of these is important. Set high goals, but be realistic about whether you can achieve them. Not everyone you invite will attend your fundraising dinner. If you have an auction, not everything will sell.\nDo research or ask around to determine how much people are willing to pay for tickets before you set the price. You don’t want to price people out, but you also want to be sure you hit your goals.",
                "Set up your team. Regardless of the scale of your event, you will need to assign staff or volunteers to coordinate various portions of the dinner:\n\n\nInvitations and marketing\nSales and donations\nLocation and decorations\nFood and catering\nEntertainment\nSpecial events (auction, bake sale, etc.)\nSet up and break down\nThank you notes",
                "Establish a host committee. If you are running a foundation or non-profit with high level donors, you will want to call on wealthy donors, business leaders, and local celebrities to set up a “host committee” – people who contribute large amounts to the event and encourage others to do so as well.[3]\n\nTry to reach out first to people who have shown a past interest in the cause your dinner seeks to fund. Call or meet with them to discuss the event, why it is important, and how they can help.[4]\n\nAlso be sure to include key stakeholders – for example an executive from a corporation sponsoring your event.[5]\n\nThough your committee is geared mostly towards soliciting donations, it helps to create subcommittees with clearly defined tasks – volunteer recruitment, fundraising and sponsorship, entertainment – so that committee members feel ownership of the entire event without feeling overburdened.[6]",
                "Create a budget. You can’t decide how much to charge for tickets, or how many additional activities you’ll need (auctions, bake sales, etc.) until you know your budget. List all expenses, such as:[7]\n\nStaff.\nInvitations.\nSpace rental.\nCatering.\nEntertainment.\nTransportation.\nSecurity.\nUtilities.\nExtra for unforeseen costs.",
                "Choose a space. If preparing your own food, you will need access to somewhere with a kitchen. Schools or churches can save money by hosting the event. Non-profits with interesting settings, like zoos and libraries, should also consider hosting. For most dinner fundraisers, though, you will want to rent a space. When renting, be sure to ask these questions:[8]\n\nDoes the venue offer discount rates for non-profits?\nAre there days of the week the space costs less?\nIf you are a large scale non-profit with many members, ask if they are willing to donate space in return for free advertising in your promotional materials (emails, flyers, Facebook page, etc.).\nWill the vendor consider waiving costs like security, cleanup, etc. for non-profits?\nAre they willing to give a percentage of the food or alcohol tab back to your cause?",
                "Decide on food. Are you going to cater the event or make your own? Is it going to be buffet style or a sit-down meal? Will there be desert? Coffee? Alcohol? Remember, the more you spend on food, the more you will have to charge for tickets if you want to hit your fundraising goals.\n\n\nTable service is more formal, but is also more time consuming and expensive. A buffet is less formal and less expensive.\nIf making your own food, consider picking a meal that is easy to prepare for lots of people like spaghetti with salad and garlic bread, or hamburgers and veggieburgers with salad.[9] Having guests bring dessert will save on time and money.[10]\n\nIf catering, ask if local restaurants will consider catering for free in lieu of a donation. Mention that this will be great advertising for their business.\nYou’ll also need to have a plan for what to do with leftover food. Consider donating it.",
                "Think about adding entertainment. For expensive dinners, you will want to consider live music, and perhaps a speaker. A band also goes over well for churches or schools, but also consider using free talent – a talent show, the school band or the church choir.[11]",
                "Consider combining your dinner with an auction or bake sale. Auctions, in particular, can bring in a lot of extra money, but they take work. You’ll need an auction coordinator to solicit donations from local businesses. For schools and churches, also consider having the parents or members donate their own skills or prepare their own items, like gift baskets.",
                "Know your audience. Is this a broad invitation – the entire church, school, or town? Or are you focusing on a particular group – church members who have made large donations, a grade or class at school, or people involved with your project? Knowing your audience will also help you decide where to hold your event and what type of food and entertainment to choose.",
                "Word of mouth. For schools and churches, this is the easiest and most effective means of advertisement, since you have your members / students in front of you at least once a week. Tell them about the upcoming fundraiser and why it is important. Try to tell a compelling story. That’s the best way to get people to spread the word.\n\n\nFraming your event as a story will best capture attention. Start with the need you are addressing and a concrete example of it before moving onto the even itself. For example: Last week the kids’ art projects all got wet when the roof leaked; we’re holding a fundraising dinner to raise money for a new roof. It will be great!\nFor churches, be sure to mention the fundraiser in sermons, at bible studies, and other church events in the weeks leading up to it.\nFor schools, discuss the fundraiser at school meetings and PTA meetings. Also send informational fliers for parents home with children.\nFor non-profits, be sure to mention the fundraiser whenever you can, Every conversation, especially with potential donors, is a chance to hype your event.",
                "Use direct mail and email. Lower budget fundraisers might want to stick with email to save money. For more expensive fundraisers, send well-produced mailings. A series of mailings or emails in the months leading up to the event works best.\n\n[12]",
                "Post flyers and posters in neighborhood stores and public spaces. A simple flyer will suffice to get the word out. When posting, be sure to talk about your event to store owners. Word of mouth can be even more powerful than your flyer.[13]\n\nCoffee shops often have boards where you can post fliers.\nLocal retail stores will often let you put fliers in their window.\nIf a church or school, be sure to post fliers on the grounds in multiple places where people will see them.",
                "Use social media and the internet. Adults in the U.S. spend an average of 42 minutes a day on Facebook, 34 on Tumblr, 21 on Instagram and Pinterest, and 17 on Twitter.[14] If you want to reach people, you need to be online, too.\n\n\nCreate a Facebook page. You can give updates, post pictures of the venue, and run contests that get people engaged (most clever post, best fundraiser themed picture, etc.).[15] At the very least, use the Event app on Facebook to create a page for your event and invite friends who might be interested.[16]\n\nStart a blog. It takes time and effort, but a blog is a great way to tell people the story of your event and what you are trying to accomplish, as well as getting them excited for the big night. Consider farming out blog duties to a number of people, each writing an article a day.[17]\n\nTweet. Twitter has a smaller reach than Facebook, but can be useful, particularly for driving people to your blog or Facebook page.\nBuy ads. Look for local websites that offer inexpensive banner ads, or consider targeted advertising on Facebook. For higher impact, use your ads to direct people to your blog.[18]",
                "Advertise in local papers and magazines. Particularly for neighborhood events, an ad in the local paper can be very effective. Be sure to include the basics: who, what, when, where, and why.[19]",
                "Make a YouTube video. It does not have to be a work of art. A couple of people talking about how important your cause is, or a few pictures with voice over, is enough. Link to the video from your Facebook page or send a link in one of your email announcements.",
                "Send a news release to local media. Let newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and magazines know that you are hosting an event and that you would like coverage. Provide lots of information so the event is easy for them to write up. Even small events can often get an article in the local newspaper. Larger, more expensive events might attract more coverage.[20]",
                "Make a plan. You should have a schedule of events, and all staff or volunteers should know where they need to be during the event and the flow of activities. Be sure you have also discussed timing with any vendors.[21] You’ll want to include things like:\n\n\nWhen vendors and volunteers need to arrive to set up.\nWhen volunteers will meet before the event to discuss and rehearse as needed.\nWhen guests will arrive and how they will be greeted, guided into the event.\nWhen entertainment or additional activities like auctions will start.\nWhen food service will start.\nWhen and how food clean-up will begin.\nWhen the event will end.\nWho will stay for clean up and break down.",
                "Have a person assigned to troubleshooting. Not everything will go perfectly. If you are at a high-level fundraiser and are trying to speak with important guests, you don’t want to have to be troubleshooting at the same time. Local fundraisers can also be harrowing if everyone is worrying about last minute details. Assigning someone this task will make everyone else’s life easier.",
                "Arrive early to set things up. If you are preparing your own food or providing your own entertainment, you’ll need to arrive several hours early to start cooking and setting up. If you are catering and hiring entertainment, your event organizers will still need to arrive early in the day to make sure that the space is open and vendors are arriving and setting up as promised.",
                "Check that everything is in order. Before guests arrive, you’ll want to go through a series of checks to make sure everything is running smoothly. Check:[22]\n\nThe sound system.\nThe lights.\nThe décor.\nThe number or chairs.\nThe silverware / flatware.\nThe readiness of performers and food.",
                "Help the guest park. You should work out where guests will park in advance. Have people on the street ready to direct traffic. For events at rented spaces, it is nice to have valet parking available.",
                "Greet the guests. Have people posted outside to direct people in. For events during the winter, a coat check or a place to hang jackets is important. You will of course also need people at the entrance to greet guests, take their tickets, and distribute a program if there is one.\n\n\nA program not only informs guests about the order of events, it is also a great opportunity to reinforce your fundraising message by including information about your cause.",
                "Work the room. You will want to be sure to take advantage of the opportunity to talk to attendees about your cause and projects. While the dinner’s goal is to make money, it is also an opportunity to cultivate donors. Be friendly and introduce guests to one another, but don’t be afraid to also specifically ask for commitments to annual pledges or special projects.[23]",
                "Stay on time. This is imperative. Having your dinner drag on too long is a sure way to lose your guests' interest. Someone should be tasked with the job of keeping the dinner running on time. That means you need to start on time, hit your marks during the night, and end on time.[24]",
                "Send thank you letters. Your efforts are not over when the dinner ends. It is important to continue to cultivate donors and volunteers so that they will be willing to give more time and money in the future. Be sure to send thank you notes to all contributors, volunteers, and vendors.[25]",
                "Let people know how great the event was. The best way to have a great fundraiser is to make it an annual thing, so that word of mouth has time to spread. Start getting ready for next years fundraiser right away by reminding everyone how great this year’s was. Post event photos to Facebook, twitter, or instagram. Contact local media to let them know how successful the fundraiser was.[26]",
                "Do a post-dinner autopsy. If you want next year’s event to be even better, you need to learn from this one. The event leaders should meet in the week after the event to discuss what worked and what could have worked better. This is especially important for organizations like schools, which may not have the same volunteers from year to year. Writing down what you have learned can create institutional knowledge you can pass on to the next bunch of parents."

        "How to Lose 5 Pounds in 5 Weeks": {
            "intro": "Losing five pounds in five weeks is considered healthy and safe weight loss. Losing any more than one to two pounds per week can put you at risk for nutrient deficiencies, fatigue, and is usually not sustainable for longer periods of time.[1] Very low calorie diets used for more rapid weight loss make it very difficult to eat enough of the vital nutrients your body needs. However, with small changes to your diet and lifestyle, losing five pounds in five weeks can be quite easy while still be safe and healthy for most people.",
            "steps": [
                "Talk to your doctor. Before starting any weight loss plan, talk to your doctor. She'll be able to discuss your weight goals and let you know if weight loss is safe and healthy for you.\n\n\nAsk your doctor about being referred to a registered dietitian. She may have a colleague she works with on a regular basis.\nA registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that can help you design your weight loss plan, assist with meal planning, or suggest certain foods for weight loss.\nVisit the EatRight website and click on the orange \"Find an Expert\" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.",
                "Count calories. Losing five pounds in five weeks can be fairly simple — especially when you count calories. To lose about one pound a week, aim to cut out 500 calories daily from your diet. This generally results in about a one pound weight loss per week.\n\n\nDo not cut out too many calories or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. This may result in nutrient deficiencies as it can be difficult to consume enough vital nutrients on very low calorie diets.[2]",
                "Keep a food journal. A food journal is a great weight loss tool. You can use it to see what changes you can make in your diet and also to help keep you on track throughout your diet.\n\n\nPurchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smart phone. Track as many days as you can — both weekday and weekend days. Many people eat differently on the weekends, so including both weekend and weekdays is important.[3]\n\nWhen you're first starting your journal, take note of how many calories you're eating daily. Many of the food journal apps do this for you automatically. This can give you a idea of a calorie goal to follow for your weight loss plan.",
                "Write up a meal plan. Meal plans are another great tool for weight loss. Planning out your meals and snacks in advance can help you stay on track and stick to your plan.\n\n\nConsult a dietitian in regards to a meal plan to ensure that it is accurate and appropriate for your health history.\nTake a day each week to write out your meal plan. Include all meals and snacks that you'll need for the week.\nYour meal plan can also help you create a grocery list each week so you only buy the items you need.",
                "Eat lean protein at each meal. Protein is an essential nutrient, especially in terms of weight loss. Eating lean protein at each meal has been shown to aid in weight loss and can help you lose more weight in the long-term.[4]\n\nEat an appropriate portion size of protein at each meal. Aim to include about 3-4 oz of lean protein at each meal.[5] This is approximately about the size of a deck of cards or a checkbook.\nInclude a variety of lean protein at each meal and throughout the day. Lean protein options include: poultry, eggs, lean red meat, pork, seafood, and low-fat dairy.\nVegetarian protein sources are also considered lean. These include: beans, lentils, nuts, tofu, and tempeh.",
                "Make half of your meals a fruit or vegetable. Fruits and vegetables should make up a fairly large portion of your diet. These foods are low calorie and full of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.\n\n\nFor a well-balanced diet, try to include a fruit or vegetable at each meal and snack.\nOne serving of vegetables is about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy green vegetables.[6]\n\nOne serving of fruit is 1 small whole fruit, 1 cup of sliced fruit, or 1/2 cup dried fruit.[7]",
                "Eat only 100% whole grains. Whole grain foods provide your diet with an essential source of fiber and some vitamin and minerals. They are minimally processed and contain the bran, germ and endosperm of the grain.[8]\n\n1 serving of whole grains is 1 oz or 1/2 cup of grains like rice or pasta.[9] Using a food scale is another accurate way of measuring pasta or other grains.\nExamples of whole grain foods include: quinoa, brown rice, 100% whole wheat bread, millet, barely, oats, or 100% whole wheat pasta.",
                "Snack healthy. An occasional snack can help make weight loss easier. This is especially true if a snack will help prevent you from overeating at a meal.[10]\n\nTake caution when deciding to snack. A snack can be a great tool to get you through an extended period of time between meals (more than four or five hours) or as pre/post workout fuel. [11]\n\nKeep snacks to about 100-200 calories. Also, try to include lean protein, fruits or vegetables, or whole grains. The combination of protein and fiber may help keep you satisfied longer. [12]\n\nHealthy snacks can include: low-fat cheese and an apple, low-calorie protein bar, or a greek yogurt and fruit.",
                "Drink water. Aim to get an adequate amount of fluids daily. It's generally recommended to consume around eight glasses or 64 oz daily. Although the amount is different for everyone, adequate hydration can also aid in weight loss.[13]\n\nKeep a water bottle close by and monitor how much you're drinking each day.\nAlso, drinking right before a meal can calm your hunger and decrease your overall intake at your meal.",
                "Avoid indulgent foods. When you're trying to lose weight, it's important to moderate how much you indulge in your favorite foods. Many indulgent foods or comfort foods are higher in calories and fat and can slow down or prevent weight loss.\n\n\nSave indulgent foods like sweets or higher fat foods for a special occasion. Or, try consuming them in moderation — like once or twice a month.\nIf you're planning on indulging, consume a small portion to keep the calories in control.",
                "Avoid alcohol. Drinking alcohol on a regular basis can prevent or slow down your weight loss. Alcohol can be very high in calories and sugar (especially in mixed drinks). Limit or avoid alcohol.\n\n\nWomen should limit alcohol to a maximum of 1 glass daily and men should limit alcohol to a maximum of 2 glasses daily.[14]\n\nLike indulgent treats, if you enjoy drinking alcohol, try to consume it in moderation. For example, a glass of wine once or twice a week.",
                "Include cardio exercises weekly. Although exercise doesn't cause weight loss by itself, including regular physical activity will help support your weight loss efforts. Aim to be active for at least 150 minutes each week.[15]\n\nAerobic activities can include exercises like: dance classes, hiking, jogging, or biking.\nBe wary of the calorie estimates on cardio machines. The numbers listed aren't necessarily accurate for your height, weight, or gender.[16]",
                "Participate in strength training. Resistance training is a great compliment to cardiovascular activity and your weight loss. As you build more muscle mass, you will increase your metabolism and burn more calories overall.[17]\n\nIt's recommended to include two days of strength training each week.[18]\n\nStrength training includes activities like: weight lifting, Pilates, or isometric exercises like push-ups or crunches.",
                "Sign up for a session with a personal trainer. Scheduling a session or two with a personal trainer might be a good idea. This is especially true if you're unfamiliar with some exercises or want to find an exercise routine that will support your new weight loss plan.\n\n\nA personal trainer can assist you in creating an exercise plan that is progressive, periodized, and appropriate for your abilities/goals.\nMany gyms offer a free or discounted personal training session when you join or as part of your membership.\nA personal training session might be costly, but you may only need one or two sessions to learn a routine or learn how to use the machines.",
                "Weigh yourself every day. It will be important to weigh yourself every single day around the same time.[19] This is especially true since you want to lose five pounds in five weeks; since it's a shorter dieting period, you'll want to make sure that your diet plan is working well.\n\n\nPurchase a home scale so you have the right tools at home to keep yourself on track.\nFor the most accurate weights, weigh yourself in the same clothing each day.\nRegular weigh-ins have also been shown to help prevent weight-gain.[20]",
                "Evaluate your diet. In order to meet your goal of losing five pounds in five weeks, it'll be important to check in and evaluate your diet along the way. Since the timeline is so short, if you notice your diet is not causing adequate weight loss, you'll want to make adjustments as soon as possible.\n\n\nIf you're not losing weight, check in with your food journal and calorie count. Are you slipping up? Snacking more often or eating larger portions? Make the necessary changes or cut out a few more calories to induce weight loss.",
                "Avoid ditching your diet plan. Ideally, after you've lost your desired amount of weight, you should keep it off. Stick to your diet plan long-term to maintain your weight loss.\n\n\nMaintain the lifestyle changes you've made: monitoring calories, portions sizes, and eating a balanced diet daily.\nAlso monitor how often you indulge in treats or alcohol. Although the occasional treat is OK, keep them to a minimum long-term to help maintain your weight."

        "How to Survive Under Martial Law": {
            "intro": "Martial law occurs when a military assumes the responsibility of governance. The rights of citizens are usually limited during martial law, and democratic processes are eliminated in favor of authoritarian power. Though it may not be easy, there are ways to make the experience less brutal and survive until the conflict is resolved.",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare for the civil unrest. Pay attention to current events. Know when potential threats are coming to the area. You may have no warning when another country invades yours.[1] However, you may know if a hurricane or tornado is coming your way. Websites like www.ready.gov are devoted to disaster preparedness.\n\n\nStock your home with supplies.[2] Before martial law is enacted, you may be on your own during a breakdown of civil authority. Be ready to survive at least 72 hours[3] without help.\nProtect your home and business. After civil authority has broken down, people may become opportunistic. Homes and businesses may be looted.[4] Secure your home and business in advance. Board up windows and barricade doors. Stay in your home with your own supplies until military help arrives.",
                "Recognize the legitimacy of martial law. For whatever reason, martial law has been declared and you are one of the citizens functioning under it. If your country has been invaded (i.e., your area is still under the protection of your country's military) or a major natural disaster has occurred you should recognize that martial law might be best for moment. The soldiers are there to maintain order and keep you safe until civilian authority can be re-established.[5]",
                "Show respect and courtesy to authorities.[6] They are not perfect human beings and mistakes will happen. The best thing you can do is assist and obey. Keep your head down and don't draw attention to yourself. This isn't the time for political activism if you want to survive.\n\n\nKeep everything you can't live without on your person. If you are being moved there may be no time to go back for your things. Have everything you need on you at all times in case you have to move immediately. Anything you might be tempted to go back for, keep on you. If there is some object too big to carry around you may have to leave it.\nIn rare situations you may be able to hide something special until you are able to come back for it. You may want to consider burying a \"time capsule\" in a waterproof container to retrieve when you return.",
                "Follow all directives given to you. No matter how odd or strange it is best to do as you are told. If a curfew is set, be in your quarters by then. If you are given a meal time, don't think you will be served if you show up late even if you are hungry. If certain areas are off-limits, do not go exploring beyond the boundary. Your rights are greatly limited until civil order is re-established so don't push your boundaries if you want to survive.\n\n\nIf you are under martial law in a country that you know intends to do you harm (e.g., Jewish Germans[7] or Japanese-Americans[8] during World War II) you may want to consider hiding from the government instead of being a good citizen.\nYou may want to learn military time.[9] Some watches and phones can be adjusted to show military time automatically. In general, times are written out differently such that 9:00AM (\"nine o'clock AM) becomes 0900 (\"zero nine hundred) and 3:30PM (\"three-thirty PM) becomes 1530 (\"fifteen thirty). In other words, PM times are 12 greater than normal and times are described as if they are four-digit whole numbers without the colon with the hour always represented as two numbers (don't drop leading zeros). Hours may be referred to in \"hundreds\" but never \"thousands\".",
                "Obey orders as you are instructed.[10] Orders are usually quick and fast and without explanation. Resisting or forcing an explanation may be dangerous. Military personnel may be given orders they don't even understand. They expect you to follow orders just as they are doing. Time sensitive orders they may not have time to explain or their explanation may cause a panic. Trust that their goal is to protect you and any failure they would take personally.",
                "Help others as much as you are able. The military personnel may be short staffed. Offer to help as much as you can. You will garner their respect this way. You may then learn more about what's going on and why things are happening as they are. If you find out important information that you have permission to share, spread the word. Make sure other people know what's going on and hopefully everyone will be able to survive the event.",
                "Establish a survival bunker in a hidden location.[11] This bunker should be able to keep you and your family safe for several years. The best bunkers are usually underground. Many are underground but in the sides of mountains or hills. The goals is to be able to get in and out but for no one else to be able to find you.\n\n\nKeep your bunker secret[12] by never carrying your phone or GPS enabled device with you when you visit. Even when you turn your GPS off, you may still be tracked with cell phone tower signals. Don't discuss your plans with anyone outside your family and resist the temptation to \"show off\" on social media.",
                "Stock your survival bunker with supplies.[13] Everything you would need for several years worth of living. This will include food, water, and medicine. You can consult a survival guide or book to determine the best setup. Think about everything you and your family uses frequently over the course of a year and make sure you have everything you absolutely need.\n\n\nSome items such as medicines may be difficult to acquire by legitimate means. Proper storage may also be difficult. Favor solid form pills over liquids as their shelf life tends to be longer even after the expiration date.[14]\n\nStore medicine in a cool dry place to extend potency, and remember that taking drugs after their expiration date is rarely harmful.",
                "Get to your survival bunker as quickly as possible. If you are going to stay ahead of the military you will need to move fast. As soon as martial law is declared you may not have time to discuss what to do next. You may think the military isn't there yet but local law enforcement may start implementing martial law beforehand. Have everything you want or need in your survival bunker and move there as soon as humanly possible.",
                "Keep a radio on hand to keep track of when martial law has ended. Most likely you will not be able to stay in your bunker forever. You will need to keep contact with the outside world.[15] You need to know when it will be safe to emerge. Since batteries degrade, you may want to use a survival radio that incorporates a hand-crank for power.[16]\n\nBe cautious of pro-military propaganda. Know what frequencies local militias are broadcasting on and any code words. Don't listen to just anything but wait until the militias give you the OK that civil authority has been restored.",
                "Stay in your bunker until you are sure it is safe to leave. The hardest part of hiding is the isolation. However, each time you step out of the bunker may risk the fate of your whole family. Someone may see you entering or exiting your bunker. You may accidentally leave tracks or human scent near the entrance. Search dogs may then be able to find you. Stay in your bunker as long as you possibly can before emerging.\n\n\nIf you are in your bunker for a long time, prioritize your food based on expiration date. Eat whatever might expire soon first.",
                "Have a go-bag ready for the day martial law is declared.[17] If you think martial law is going to be enacted by any military force hostile to you then you should consider being ready. Will you have a better chance resisting or submitting? Have a go-bag with all the supplies you need to make it from where you are to where you are supposed to be.\n\n\nYour go-bag should be light but fully stocked. Estimate how far you may ever be from your bunker to determine what you need for your bag. You should favor small and light items as you may be carrying the bag. This includes basic survival gear and food in case you have to walk or hike to your bunker.[18]",
                "Stash guns, ammo, supplies, and survival gear in a hidden bunker.[19] This will be your family's rally point when martial law happens. Be sure to include everything you will need to wait out the storm. Your bunker should be equipped such that once you go in, you won't need to leave for supplies for months. If you have valuables you don't want to leave behind, go ahead and store them in your bunker in advance. You may not have time to go home to pack before the military rolls into town.\n\n\nStocking your bunker with supplies can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. Start with a 72-hour setup for natural disaster preparedness.[20] Then move toward a two-week day bomb shelter.[21][22] Once you get the hang of it, increase to however long you think you'll need.",
                "Know the rally point established by the local militia. Most likely you are not the only person or family to see what's coming. Other people are likely getting ready for the military to take over. Become part of your local militia and find out what your plans are to resist a malevolent military. You may need to be quick in attacking local supply depots and establishing an effective resistance.",
                "Group up with your militia as soon as humanly possible. Once you have your own home base established with your family protected, be ready to move. Militias survive as long as there are enough people to protect strategic locations. Your militia will need all the manpower they can get. Take a few supplies and rations but leave most of it in your bunker. Your militia should have their own hidden stockpiles[23] of supplies if they will ever be successful.\n\n\nBe careful not to reveal your home base or inventory of supplies to your militia. If the militia crumbles you need a safe place to fall back to. If your militia is in danger, they may see your home base as a supply depot leaving you and your family in jeopardy.",
                "Establish a chain of command and follow orders.[24] Until now a military chain of command may have been hypothetical or loosely enforced. Now its time to follow orders without question. Establish the leadership structure and who you must report to and who reports to you. Most likely there will be people in your ranks with prior military experience. Their expertise will be crucial to maintaining order.",
                "Stay with your militia as you move to a safe location. If you survive and fight long enough, you may need to move to another safe location. This may be a retreat or you may be grouping up with other local militias to form a larger resistance force. You may be moving to re-establish civil authority. Regardless, if the supplies of your bunker are running out your options are limited. You will likely not be alone in this respect. You will need to move with the militia to a safe location to continue resisting the government long term."

        "How to Put Things Into a Babysitting \"Fun Bag\"": {
            "intro": "A babysitting \"fun bag\" is one way to bring fun new things to keep the children amused while you're in charge. It can be filled with all sorts of things you might have at home, as long as they're safe, age-appropriate and don't go against anything the parents would prefer for their children. In this article, you'll get an idea of the sorts of things that might work for your babysitting ventures.",
            "steps": [
                "Get a big bag. The bag needs to be easy to carry or wear, as well as having sufficient space to carry the fun items you want to take with you. Suitable bags include a backpack or a drawstring bag.\n\n\nGiven that the bag may need to carry a fair weight, choose one that is sturdy and strong.\nLook for a bag with pockets or holders. These can be handy compartments for dividing the different items up, while still being able to find them easily.",
                "Know your audience. Before you choose the items to add to the bag, be guided by the children you'll be babysitting. Know their ages, personal likes and dislikes, hobbies/interests and what sorts of things they already have in the house. Also ask their parents if there are things that the children are not allowed to do or play with.\n\n\nIf you are bringing food, be aware that this can be a very touchy subject. If the children are on a special diet mom and dad think matters, don't even try to foist your food onto the kids or there may be trouble. Be alert for allergies and weight-related issues and obey the parent's instructions. If the parents are happy for you to bring candies, be reasonable and only bring a few; this isn't an excuse to sugar-fuel the kids!",
                "Add books to the bag. Depending on the ages of the kids, put different books into the bag. Being able to read and show books the kids haven't seen in their own collection will keep them entertained and interested.\n\n\nChildren under 1 would enjoy baby board books with rhythm and short stories. Books that you can touch and feel are also great!\nFor example,1-4 year olds would enjoy Dr.Suess, 5-7 year olds would enjoy early reader books, 8+ year olds would like good chapter books.",
                "Bring some toys. While there are going to be toys already at the place, new toys can be exciting and will keep the children interested for the visit thanks to the novelty. You may need to ask the parents first, to be sure that the toy isn't one the children already own.\n\n\nBabies would enjoy rattles and anything that shakes. They would also like mobiles or activity gyms, activity quilts, plush toys, or bright baby toys. Toys that squeak such as play cubes or soft balls are other toys for babies.\nToddlers (1-3 year olds) would like baby dolls, bubbles, any toy that is colorful and looks real, or pretend vehicles designed for toddlers.\nGirls 4-8 would probably like dress up and makeover things. Some crafts that are not to detailed but more than coloring work as well. Bring over some simple card and board games designed for this age.\n9+ is a bit more trickery but most of the time kids that age like Bingo and other classic board games. They also like friends and girls will probably like more sophisticated crafts that are detailed. Children this age also love age-appropriate video games, bring a few over, though you should be sure they do not spend more than an hour of your babysitting time playing them.\nTomboys would like footballs and soccer balls.\nToddler boys would probably enjoy Duplos. 4-8 year olds might like car toys, trucks, etc.\nApps on your iPad might prove fun for the kids if they haven't seen your games or educational apps yet.",
                "Try movies. Bring along an age-appropriate movie, either a DVD or one on your electronic device. Check the rating and always ask the parents if it's okay to show the movie.\n\n\nFor ages 1-3:Choose ones for this age group. For three year olds, bring over Dora or Paw Patrol. For ages 1-2 try Baby Einstein.\nFor ages 4-8:Disney Princess movies are popular for girls in this age group.Boys would like Cars,All dogs to heaven, etc.\nFor ages 9+:Classic ones like Lion King are usually ok for kids 9+.",
                "Add in extras. For things every kid will enjoy, stuff for forts usually entertains everyone. Bring an old sheet or two, and some comfy cushions. Of course, you could also check with the parents to see if they have bulkier things like cushions and pillows that they don't mind you using to build a fort.\n\n\nPuppets are often enjoyed by children of all ages, especially if you're entertaining and funny when putting on a show with the puppets. Try finger puppets for 2-4 year olds and simple hand puppets for children birth-age 1.\nStickers are a great addition. They're light, fun to play with and can be used to make amazing collages, pictures and personal books.\nDress ups can be fun. Throw in a few funny pieces of clothing and clown wig for a fun game.",
                "After you've packed your bag, remember to take it with you each time. After a few times, you'll get used to what to put in the bag (and what to leave out), as well as rotating the items to prevent boredom if you babysit the same kids regularly. Enjoy the experience and share your ideas with others, to help them make great fun bags too."

                "Consider using strips and rinses. In addition to toothpastes, there are other over-the-counter products that can help reduce the appearance of nicotine stains on your teeth. Purchase whitestrips, and follow the directions on the package. You can choose from those that dissolve in your mouth or strips that you remove after a specific period of time. Strips are an effective and inexpensive way to brighten your teeth.[2]",
                "Use natural ingredients. There are many items in your home — especially your kitchen —which are natural whitening agents. Lemon juice acts as a natural bleaching agent and can make your teeth appear shiny and clean. Mix some lemon juice with water, and rinse your mouth with this solution.\n\n\nYou can also make a paste using baking powder and strawberries. Just mash two to three berries together with 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. Use a toothbrush to cover your teeth with the paste. After five minutes, rinse your mouth with water. These ingredients will help to brighten the appearance of your yellow teeth.[3]\n\nThere are also certain foods to avoid. Too much coffee, cola, and red wine can increase the discoloration that occurs with nicotine use. Try to avoid them.[4]",
                "Rinse with hydrogen peroxide. Another common household product that can brighten your teeth is hydrogen peroxide. Dilute a small amount (less than an ounce) of hydrogen peroxide with water and rinse your mouth. After several seconds, spit it out, and thoroughly rinse with water. This solution is an easy way to lighten yellow stains.[5]\n\nAnother way to create a shiny look to your teeth can be achieved by holding mouthwash in your mouth and then start brushing your teeth, pushing the brush in past your closed lips. In short, you brush your teeth with the mouthwash. The final result can be surprising.",
                "Be patient. Nicotine stains are often more difficult to treat than discoloration caused by food or other factors like medication or discoloration following a root canal. Because nicotine stains are so stubborn, it can take longer to reduce their appearance. Be aware that it may take two to three months to see results. Don't give up if you can't see an immediate impact.[6]",
                "Choose your dentist carefully. For many people, going to the dentist can be an unpleasant experience. But it you do your research and find a dentist who makes you feel comfortable, you'll likely feel much more at ease. Ask your friends and relatives for recommendations. You can also read online reviews from previous patients. Make sure to choose a dentist who listens carefully and thoroughly explains all of your options.[7]",
                "Have a laser treatment. Your dentist might recommend laser whitening to help eradicate the nicotine stains on your teeth. This process involves painting your teeth with a peroxide solution and exposing your teeth to very strong light. This is a painless procedure that takes anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour.[8]",
                "Try chemical whitening. With this option, your dentist will use a bleaching agent to whiten your teeth. Sometimes, you might be sent home with a mouth tray and a supply of bleaching gel. Your dentist will instruct you to wear the tray for a certain amount of time each day. Other times, she might do the entire bleaching procedure in the office. Either way, it is painless.[9]\n\nBe aware of risks. One of the most common side effects is increased sensitivity in your teeth. Ask your dentist about this possibility.[10] In addition, in some cases, depending on the bite or the concentration of the whitening substance, tooth structure becomes weak and teeth may experience small cracks or even chip.",
                "Consider veneers. Porcelain laminate veneers are paper thin \"shells\" made from porcelain that are used to create the appearance of bright, healthy teeth. The dentist will remove some of your tooth enamel, then apply a layer of adhesive, followed by the veneer. Veneers are considered one of the most effective ways to whiten and brighten your smile. Plus, they are stain-resistant. Ask your dentist if they are an option for you.[11]\n\nThere is also an option for \"no-prep\" veneers, which does not require the dentist to remove enamel before applying the veneer. This is not appropriate for everyone, however, so talk to your dentist to see if you are a candidate.\nThere are also composite veneers, which are less expensive than porcelain veneers. They are made of composite resin, which is a tooth-colored filling material.[12]",
                "Prepare a budget. Any trip to the dentist can be pricey. Even if you have dental insurance, many plans to not cover whitening, as it is considered a cosmetic procedure. Contact your insurance company to find out the details of your coverage. Then, contact your dentist to inquire about pricing for the procedure that interests you.[13]\n\nOnce you know how much money you need to spend to reduce the appearance of nicotine stains, start planning your budget. It is possible that your dentist accepts payment plans. If not, come up with some ways to pinch your pennies.",
                "Learn about discoloration. Nicotine can quickly cause yellowing of your teeth. This occurs whether you smoke cigarettes or use chewing tobacco. Nicotine and tar settle into the very small cracks in the enamel of your teeth, and cause discoloration.[14]\n\nIt has been shown that nicotine helps the process of plaque formation, which leads to a faster deposit of tartar and can cause bad breath.",
                "Know the risks of disease. In addition to discoloration, nicotine use can cause other physical problems for your teeth and gums. You may be prone to increased cavities, gum disease, and certain types of oral cancer. All of these ailments can decrease the healthy appearance of your teeth.[15]",
                "Practice good oral hygiene. One way to prevent the yellowing of teeth is to make sure that you are taking excellent care of your mouth. Good oral hygiene includes brushing your teeth twice a day. You should use a whitening toothpaste in combination with a soft-bristled tooth brush. Brush firmly but gently at least twice a day.[16]\n\nFlossing is also important. You should make sure to use dental floss once a day. This can remove buildup of foreign material between your teeth.",
                "Try to quit. The best way to put a stop to the yellowing of your teeth is to quit using nicotine. Quitting is a very difficult process, but there are many methods you can try. Consider using cessation aids, such as chewing gum or nicotine patches. There are also prescription medications to help with your addition. Ask your doctor for help in choosing a safe and effective method.[17]"

        "wikiHow to Soften a Leather Belt": {
            "intro": "Leather belts can be stiff and uncomfortable, especially when they're new. Leather can also grow dry and cracked if the material is not treated regularly. Fortunately, you can use a number of skin-safe chemical treatments to soften a belt so that it sits more comfortably.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Swab the belt with rubbing alcohol. Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball for an easy applicator. Then, wipe the leather surface thoroughly with the rubbing alcohol. This should clean the leather and open up the pores of the material. Make sure that the alcohol is deeply soaked into the leather. You may need to apply many coats.[2]\n\nYou can buy isopropyl rubbing alcohol at most drugstores and grocery stores. You may already have some in your cabinet!\nIf you don't have a cotton ball, use a towel, a tissue, or a clean piece of cotton. You can also use your fingers. Be careful, though: rubbing alcohol can dry out your skin with prolonged contact.",
                "Follow up with Vaseline. Put Vaseline or another petroleum jelly product onto your finger or a Q-tip. Then, spread the Vaseline across the belt so that it covers the entire surface. Let the Vaseline soak into the leather.[3]\n\nYou don't need to lump a goopy mess of petroleum jelly onto the belt in order to soften it. A thin, slick layer will do.",
                "Clean the belt. Wipe the Vaseline away with a rag or tissue. Leave the leather out to dry before you wear the belt. If you want it to dry a bit more quickly, try leaving it out in the sun.",
                "Prep the leather in the sun. Lay the leather belt outside on a sunny day. Leave it out for about ten minutes to open the pores and prepare the material.[4]",
                "Choose your oil. Coconut oil (the organic kind that you'd use for cooking) is a great easy-to-find softening agent. Try avocado oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Use any natural oil that you would put onto yourself as a skin-softener. Leather is the dried and treated skin of a cow – so it essentially made from the same stuff as your own skin.\n\n\nNatural oils have the added benefit of smelling pleasant. Rubbing alcohol and Vaseline will do a great job of softening up your belt, but you might be off-put by the decidedly chemical scent. Pick an oil that you like to smell.\nAvoid using chemically hydrogenated oils – namely, most commercial corn oils and vegetable oils.",
                "Rub the oil into the belt. Simply dip your fingers into the oil, then rub it thoroughly over the surface of the belt. Add multiple layers of oil for an improved softening effect. The more oil you use, the softer the leather will get.[5]\n\nDon't worry about using too much. Most natural oil should not damage leather.",
                "Let the oil dry into the leather. Note that the oil—especially coconut oil—may slightly darken the belt. However, it also turns your stiff leather into a smooth, wearable material. If your belt is not soft enough, try repeating the oil treatment.\n\n\nYou can use this darkening effect to change up the look of your leather belt. Just make sure that you apply it evenly so there aren't any mismatching lighter splotches!",
                "Buy a dedicated leather conditioner. You can usually buy these products (usually labeled as \"leather therapy,\" \"restorer,\" or \"conditioner\") at stores that sell saddles and bridles for horses. You may also use leather treatment products that are designed to soften, clean, and polish leather shoes.[6]\n\nMany of these ointments will actually strengthen leather. They were designed for use on saddles and bridles, and you can trust them as a lasting solution.\nBe aware that leather treatment products are usually more expensive than natural oils, Vaseline, and rubbing alcohol. Pick up one of these ointments if you have money to spend on pampering your belt.[7]",
                "Apply the conditioner. Most products will have specialized instructions listed on the bottle or tub of leather ointment. Spray, spread, or rub the conditioner into the leather and let it soak. Apply as needed. Let the belt dry before you wear it."

        "How to Keep Your Cool when You Are Criticized": {
            "intro": "It’s not always easy to remain calm when you’re the recipient of criticism, be it constructive or destructive. When you are criticized, you might feel embarrassed or misunderstood. Or, you might even be upset that another person is judging you. No matter how you feel, you need to keep your composure and accept the feedback for what it is – another person’s opinion and nothing more. Fortunately, there are some techniques to help you accept criticism and remain calm.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid a non-assertive response. Being aware of your non-assertive response to criticism is important because these behaviors are likely not acceptable, just as a violent response is unacceptable. If you notice any of these behaviors after receiving criticism, pause, remove yourself from the situation if possible, and calm down until your responses have stopped.[1]\n\nBecoming defensive\nWithdrawing\nInternalizing anger and stewing over the criticism\nShutting down\nRetaliating with anger or blame",
                "Respond assertively. Ideally, you’ll respond assertively to criticism, the most balanced response possible, meaning that you can distinguish between constructive and destructive criticism and respond appropriately. Rather than get defensive, place blame, yell at the other person, or turn the blame back to them, you accept the criticism for what it is and move on with no negative feelings.[2]\n\nResponding assertively doesn’t mean that you agree with the criticizer. Rather, it means you don’t have an emotional attachment to the criticism and respond appropriately.[3]\n\nIf the criticism is constructive and valid, your assertive response might simply be to accept the criticism or to accept it and openly agree with the other person, which shows self-confidence and willingness to change your behavior.\nAnother assertive response is to ask, “why do you say that?” in a non-accusatory way. This indicates a genuine interest in their thought process and how you’re being received.\nYou might also disagree and say, “No, I do not always forget to empty the recycle bin, although I do forget on occasion. Not always, though.” This shows that you take responsibility for your actions, but not sweeping generalizations.",
                "Agree with all, part, or none of it. You are under no obligation to accept criticism. However, you might find there is a kernel of truth in what was said, you might actually agree with everything that was said, or none of it. As long as you’re being honest with yourself about the content of the criticism, these are perfectly legitimate responses.\n\n[4]",
                "Listen and ask questions. Listen to what the other person has to say – they might offer an insight or perspective that you hadn’t considered. Pay attention to what they’re saying, not the tone of their voice, and don’t tune them out because you’re uncomfortable being criticized. After they’ve spoken, ask follow up questions to clarify any points that you might be confused about. This demonstrates that you earnestly listened and are considering what was said.[5]\n\nMake sure that your questions aren’t antagonistic or designed to prove the speaker wrong.",
                "Don’t take it personally. Usually criticism is constructive and not intended to hurt the recipient. Don’t take the criticism personally – it isn’t a character attack. Instead, understand that it’s likely addressing a specific action or behavior or yours, and doesn’t reflect on you as a person.[6]\n\nOne great technique is to look for the positive. Whether the criticism is valid or not, there is always something positive to be found. Say your boss criticizes you for not arranging the files in a way that they think makes sense. Sure, hearing that might feel rotten, but rather than take it personally, look for the positive – you get to develop an even better filing system that will universally work for everyone.\nAnother good way to not take criticism personally is to turn the meat of the criticism into “if” language. Ask yourself what the main point of the criticism was. Then, ask, “if” this were true, for example, if it were true that you were always late, how could you improve the situation? This allows you to emotionally distance yourself from the criticism and tackle the actual issue, if there is one.",
                "Summarize the criticism. Don’t focus on the tone in which you were spoken to or even everything that was said. Instead, try to summarize the criticizer’s main points. What were they ultimately getting at? Do any of those points resonate with you once you boil them down to their most basic parts? Summarizing the criticism allows you to react calmly while ensuring that you heard everything that was said.[7]",
                "Address the problem and correct misunderstandings. When you receive criticism, you need to address the problem by acknowledging that there has been a misunderstanding, agreeing completely with the other person, or disagreeing and looking for a sort of compromise. Whatever you do, remain calm and don’t pretend the conversation never happened. Face the criticism head on, without emotion, and put it behind you.[8]\n\nOne common method to remain cool when criticized is to acknowledge true statements that have been made, and to correct or clarify incorrect information. This shows that you’re engaged in the conversation, listening, and taking ownership for that which you’re responsible.",
                "Don’t let criticism stop you. Criticism is a tool meant to help a person modify their behavior or action, and nothing more. If you are criticized, it’s normal to feel uncomfortable, or even angry or confused. But don’t let it stop you. This is one person’s perspective, right or wrong, and nothing more. Take what you can from it, learn what you’re able, and continue carrying on.[9]",
                "Admit when you’re wrong. If you’re criticized and believe that the other person is right, say so. Let them know that you’ve listened to them, heard them, processed what they said, and are taking ownership of your mistake. This is an incredibly effective method for keeping cool when criticized as well as descalating any emotions.[10]\n\nYou don’t have to agree with everything that they say. You might only think that you’re wrong about one point – say so.",
                "Treat it as a learning experience. Receiving criticism can feel awful, and sometimes it can lead to feelings of self-doubt. Treat criticism as an opportunity for growth and as a learning experience, though. Maintain your self-esteem and look at the situation as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Criticism, when constructive, is meant as a helpful tool, not at an attack, and should be treated as a positive learning experience.\n\n[11]\nIt’s not always easy to separate yourself from a situation enough to find the positive. Before you react, step back, calm down, and try to objectively evaluate the situation. This should help you see it in a more positive light.",
                "Consider who has criticized you. Is this person of significance to you? Are they a friend, family member, colleague, employer, clergy member, or professor? Do they hold some type of authority over you? Decide if you think this person is in the right position to offer you criticism. If you don’t believe that they are, remain calm, thank them for their opinion, and walk away.[12]\n\nIf the other person does hold a position of authority over you, you might be put in a position of having to agree, or at least not disagree with them.",
                "Set boundaries. You might have a person in your life that belittles you or regularly criticizes you. They aren’t offering constructive feedback, but are trying to chip away at your self esteem. This person is toxic to you and probably isn’t telling you anything worthwhile. Set boundaries and decide on your response if those boundaries are crossed.[13]\n\nWhether this person is a friend, family member, or colleague, you have the right to choose who is in your life. If someone is criticizing you baselessly, you might consider that they aren’t a healthy influence for you.",
                "Put yourself in their shoes. Try to imagine the other person’s perspective and get a feel for why they might perceive your actions or behavior as they have. Do they work in a different part of the company, only interacting with you on the phone? Or perhaps they always drive the vehicle immediately after you and always see it dirty. You still might not agree with what they have to say, but trying to imagine the situation from their point of view is helpful and may clear up misunderstandings.[14]"

        "wikiHow to Talk to Spirits": {
            "intro": "Whether you’re trying to contact a particular spirit or just want to speak to the spirit world, you can contact spirits using a dowsing pendulum or a Ouija Board as long as you’re patient, keep an open mind, and follow the safe and correct steps to do so.",
            "steps": [
                "Protect yourself psychically. If you try to contact the spirit world, you may come in contact with malevolent entities. Therefore, it’s important to strengthen your mind against negative energies before attempting to talk to spirits. For example:\n\n\nOffer a prayer to the universe. While praying, ask for protection against malevolent spirits.\nVisualize yourself as a column of white light that spreads throughout the room. This visualization will dissuade negative entities.\nMentally express an interest in communicating with positive spirits to draw them to you.[1]",
                "Find a charm. If you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, such as a deceased loved one, you will need a charm to draw them to you.[2] A charm can be anything that the spirit owned while they were alive. Choose an item that held a lot of meaning for that person. Examples of meaningful items include:\n\n\nJewelry\nNotebooks or journals\nPhotographs\nA beloved book",
                "Avoid using alcohol or drugs. Alcohol and drugs affect your judgement and can make you more vulnerable to negative spirits. Additionally, some people believe that being intoxicated can attract harmful entities.[3]\n\nIf any of your friends are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, don’t let them participate in the session.",
                "Burn sage incense. Sage is an herb that is known for its aura cleansing properties. If you’re worried about the presence of malevolent spirits, burn some sage incense before contacting the spirit world. The sage will remove negative energies from the room and dissuade any unwanted visitors.[4]\n\nSage incense can be bought online or at specialty herbal supply stores.",
                "Purchase or create a dowsing crystal. A dowsing crystal is a crystal that’s hanging on the end of a string or chain. You should feel a sense of attachment to the crystal when you hold it.[5] This indicates that your energy is in tune with the crystal. To find a good dowsing crystal:\n\n\nVisit a specialty herb shop and pick out a crystal. Hold each one to find one that “speaks” to you.\nUse a crystal necklace that was owned by a deceased loved one.\nTie a piece of string around a crystal that you have owned for years.",
                "Dangle the crystal over a flat surface. Hold the end of the chain in your dominant hand.[6] Next, dangle the crystal over a hard surface, such as a table or the floor. The crystal should be near the surface, but not touching it.\n\n\nSome people prefer to dangle the crystal over a circle drawn on a piece of paper. This can help you track the movements of the crystal.",
                "Determine “yes” and “no” answers. Gently swing the crystal once or twice. Holding your hand steady, ask the spirits to show you a “yes” answer. Make a note of the pattern that the crystal follows. Once the crystal is still, repeat the process, asking for a “no” answer.[7]\n\nThis pattern may change from session to session.",
                "Begin asking questions. Ask yes or no questions and take note of the answers. For example, if you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, you might ask: “Is your name Sandra Burdoch?” The spirit will then direct the crystal in a yes or no formation.\n\n\nTake any messages received with a grain of salt. Some spirits may try to trick you or they may even be confused.[8]\n\nBe polite when talking with spirits and treat them with respect.",
                "End the session. Thank the spirit for speaking with you. Politely ask them to return to the spirit world.[9] Next, set the crystal down. Center yourself in the present by eating some food or having a cup of tea.\n\n\nIf you feel a presence lingering after you’ve ended the session, burn some sage incense to cleanse the room.",
                "Purchase or make a Ouija board. Ouija boards can be bought online or from specialized novelty shops. Occasionally, rare and ornate Ouija boards can be found at estate sales or antique shops. To make your own Ouija board, write the alphabet, the numbers 1-9, “yes,” “no,” and “goodbye” on a large sheet of paper. Next, purchase a planchette or make your own.\n\n\nThe term planchette refers to the small wooden arrow used to navigate the Ouija board.\nPlanchettes can be purchased online or from specialized novelty shops.",
                "Gather a few friends. Never use a Ouija board alone. Instead, gather one or two friends to use the board with you.[10] The presence of others will repel any cowardly malevolent spirits and bolster your courage.\n\n\nMake sure your friends will take the process seriously. If they show a lack of respect, it could have bad consequences.",
                "Set up the Ouija board. Lay the board on a table or other flat surface. Next, place the planchette on top of the board. Ask your friends to sit around the table and lightly place their index and middle fingers on the planchette.\n\n\nRelax your arms and fingers while touching the planchette. Otherwise, you may unconsciously move the planchette around on your own.",
                "Summon a spirit. Choose one person to be the medium, or the person who communicates with the spirit. Next, the medium should politely ask a spirit to visit. Wait patiently for the planchette to move. Once it starts moving independently, a spirit has appeared.[11]\n\nThis process can take several minutes.",
                "Ask the spirit questions. Once the spirit appears, the medium can begin asking questions. If you ask yes or no questions, the planchette will hover over the “yes” or “no” words on the board. If you ask more complex questions, the spirit may spell out words or even sentences. Consider asking questions such as:\n\n\n”What’s your name?”\n”Are you a ghost?”\n”Do you have a message for us?”",
                "Learn to recognize bad spirits. If the planchette moves randomly across the board without giving any clear answers, the spirit is not interested in helping you. If the planchette moves in a figure eight, the spirit is attempting to take control of the board. End the session immediately.[12]\n\nIf you begin to feel a lot of fear, end the session. Fear can invite negative spirits into the Ouija board.",
                "Close the connection. Guide the planchette over the word “goodbye” on the board. This will close the Ouija board’s connection to the spirit world. Once the session has ended, wrap the planchette in a piece of cloth and store it separately from the board.[13]\n\nIf you store the planchette and the board together, you risk unintentionally inviting spirits into your home."

        "How to Clean a Cast": {
            "intro": "Casts are used when you break a bone. They help stabilize the broken bone to let it to heal. Casts are made with either fiberglass or plaster. Most fiberglass casts are waterproof, although their liner is not unless you have a special waterproof liner. However, plaster casts have to remain dry, because water may dissolve them. Cleaning plaster casts can be difficult. When you have a plaster cast, make sure you keep it from getting dirty and from getting wet. If you have to, wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove dirt and grime.",
            "steps": [
                "Wipe the outside of the cast with a damp cloth. If you happen to get your fiberglass cast dirty, try wiping off the dirt, food, or other mark with a damp cloth.[1] Make sure the cloth is only damp and not too wet. It should not leave any pools of wetness behind on your cast.\n\n\nNo matter if you have a plaster or fiberglass cast, you should never get your cast wet or submerge it into water, even if you get it dirty. Though fiberglass casts are waterproof, the soft lining inside is not, so you want to keep them dry.[2]\n\nIf you have a fiberglass cast and a waterproof liner, you may be able to get the cast wet.",
                "Use mild detergent to clean your cast. If either type of cast gets dirty on the outside and a damp cloth isn’t enough, try using mild dish detergent. Put a small amount of dish detergent on a damp cloth. Gently and carefully wipe away the dirt.[3]\n\nUse a dry cloth to wipe away the soap and dry the cast.",
                "Keep the cast from getting dirty. The most important thing to do while you or someone else has a cast is to keep it clean. This means keeping it away from dirt and sand if possible. You should also try to limit how much you sweat in it, because sweat and grime can cause it to get dirty.[4]\n\nBe careful when you eat. Try not to drop food onto or into the cast. If you need to, cover the cast while you eat. This may be important if a child has an arm cast.",
                "Protect the cast when you bathe or shower. When you take a bath or shower, put plastic around the cast and don’t put that part of your body into the water. You can use plastic bags or trash bags secured with waterproof tape to help keep your arm dry.[5]\n\nWhen you are taking a bath, you must not get your cast wet even if you have a fiberglass cast. Don’t try to wash the cast in the shower.\nIt may be easier to give children a sponge bath to ensure that their cast stays dry.[6]\n\nIf your fiberglass cast has a waterproof liner, you might be able to take a shower. Ask your doctor before you try.",
                "Dry your plaster cast with a hairdryer on cool. If you happen to get your plaster cast wet, or you sweat inside your cast, you need to dry it inside and out. To do this, use a hairdryer set to the cool setting. This will provide air that will dry any moisture inside and outside of the cast.[7]\n\nDon’t use the hairdryer set on the warm or hot setting. This can burn the skin and cause problems. It can also cause more sweating and moisture in the cast.",
                "Let a fiberglass cast dry naturally. Your fiberglass cast with a waterproof liner can get wet, either in the shower or swimming pool.[8] After you get out of the water, it will take around an hour for the inside of the cast to dry. Be patient and let the cast dry naturally.[9]\n\nDon't use a hairdryer to try to dry the fiberglass cast faster. Don't stick a towel in or around the fiberglass cast.",
                "Use care with body casts when going to the bathroom. Body casts can be difficult to deal with and keep clean, especially when going to the bathroom. You want to make sure that if you or your child has a body cast, you do not get urine on the cast.[10]\n\nFind a way to prevent splashing urine onto the cast, such as toilet paper in the bedpan.\nMake sure no urine rolls along the skin into the cast. Wipe away the urine immediately.",
                "Avoid using deodorizers. You may want to use something to help with the smell of the cast or to help keep it clean. However, don’t do this. This can lead to more grime and problems, especially inside the cast. Keep those types of things away from the cast.[11]\n\nFor example, don’t place lotions, powder, or deodorants on, inside, or near the cast.",
                "Determine the type of cast you have. Though taking care of a fiberglass or plaster cast is similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Make sure you know what kind of cast you have and the type of liner you have so you can care for your cast properly.[12]\n\nFiberglass casts can hold up better if they happen to get wet. However, you should not submerge them in water, go swimming with them, or take a shower with them if you have a normal liner. The liner can get wet and irritate or cause sores on your skin inside the cast.\nSome fiberglass casts come with waterproof liners. If you have a waterproof liner, you may be able to submerge it in water, but only with your doctor's approval. For example, you may be able to go swimming or take a bath with it.\nPlaster casts cannot get wet. Water can damage the cast and cause problems. It may even possibly cause the cast to dissolve and fall apart. You should take care to always keep your plaster cast dry.",
                "Know when to see the doctor. If you get the cast completely wet somehow, you may need to see a doctor. Sometimes, a wet cast will completely dry, but often, a wet cast won’t dry completely, and it will cause sore spots on your skin inside the cast.[13]\n\nYou should call the doctor if you notice:\n\nPain and tightness in the injured limb\nNumbness or tingling in the injured hand or foot\nBurning or stinging under the cast\nInjured fingers or toes of injured limb becoming cold or blue\nInability to move fingers or toes of injured limb\nSwelling below the cast\nRed or raw skin around the cast\nFever of 101F (38C) or higher[14]\n\n\n\nIf the cast gotten wet but has not dried after 24 hours, call the doctor.[15]\n\nMost casts will start to smell a little after you wear them for awhile. However, any foul or extremely bad odors are an indication of a problem. You should go see a doctor if the smell is bad because this might mean you have an infection."

        "wikiHow to Care for a Texas Spiny Lizard": {
            "intro": "The Texas spiny lizard is a fairly common yet beautiful lizard inhabiting the drier regions of southern North America. Though not typically sold commercially, if you live in Texas, it’s possible to find Texas spiny lizards in a pet store or even catch one for yourself. Texas spiny lizards make great pets since they adapt well to captivity and eat a diet of readily available insects. If you provide your Texas spiny lizard with a large cage, ample play space, a good source of heat lighting, and a balanced diet, you will have a wonderful pet for around seven years.",
            "steps": [
                "Purchase a large cage. Texas spiny lizards are active creatures that grow to about 7.5” to 12”. They need a large cage that accommodates their size and provides them with plenty of space to run around. They are also arboreal, meaning they need to climb. Get a 36 to 50 gallon cage or terrarium to make sure you’ll have room for plants, logs, and vines for your lizard to play with.[1][2]\n\nBe sure the cage is enclosed so that the lizard doesn’t escape.",
                "Cover the bottom with cage carpet. To cover the bottom of the cage, you can use either cage carpet, sand, small rocks, or powdered walnut shell. Cage carpet is generally recommended, however, as lizards might consume alternative floor types, which can lead to digestive issues.[3]\n\nCage carpet can be a bit trickier to clean. Make sure to give yourself some time every month to dedicate to keeping your lizard’s cage carpet in good condition.\nCage carpet can be purchased online at PetSmart or Amazon. Call your local pet store to see if they sell cage carpet.",
                "Add plants to the terrarium. Plants will make your lizard feel more at home in its terrarium, and also give the lizard something to climb in. Put as many plants, vines, branches, and sticks that you can in the cage so that your lizard will have ample climbing material.[4]\n\nWhile it’s okay to put live plants, vines, and branches into your lizard’s home, be sure they don’t carry too much moisture. The Texas spiny lizard prefers a drier environment. It’s best to put a mixture of live and fake climbing surfaces into the cage.[5]\n\nIf you find plants outside, make sure they are free of bugs and are not poisonous.[6]\n\nOne of the Texas spiny lizard’s hobbies is digging into decayed logs. Put a piece of an old log into the cage once every few weeks to give the lizard a nice activity.",
                "Provide a hiding place. Lizards like to have a place to hide themselves every so often. Add a log that can accommodate the length of your lizard to the cooler side of the cage. Remember that Texas spiny lizards grow to about 12”.[7]\n\nIt’s best to get a hollowed out log so that your lizard can hide completely. You can buy a hollowed out log at most pet stores. If you’re handy, make one yourself![8]\n\nYou’ll also want to have a part of the cage left open for the lizard to play in. Try to put this on the opposite side of the cage from the hiding spot.",
                "Give your lizard ample light. Texas spiny lizards are diurnal and like to bask in the sun, so will need full spectrum UVB cage lighting to stay healthy and happy. You’ll want the cage to be between 80-88 degrees during the day, 70–80 degrees at night, and 100-108 in the lizard’s basking spot.[9]\n\nMake a basking platform around 12 inches from the basking light. The UVB rays aren’t strong enough to be placed any farther away from the lizard.[10]\n\nOnly put lighting on one side of the cage since your lizard needs a cool place as well.\nAsk about how to properly set up cage lighting at a local pet store to ensure your lizard’s health and safety.",
                "Feed your lizard a mix of insects. Texas spiny lizards require a diet of live insects, and will thrive if you provide them with a variety of species. Giant mealworms, crickets, waxworms, regular mealworms, silkworms, and non-noxious caterpillars are all great choices.[11]\n\nFeed your lizard once a day. If your lizard is active and healthy, feed them as much as they can eat over a 15-20 minute time period. If they are overweight, talk to a vet about a diet plan that will keep your lizard healthy.[12]\n\nBe sure that the insects are relatively small in comparison to the lizard’s head. Otherwise the lizard may suffer digestive problems. Cut the insects yourself if the pieces seem too large.\nIf you live near fields or meadows that are not sprayed with insecticides, you can collect your own insects (known as “field plankton”) with a sweep net during warmer months.[13]\n\nRemove any uneaten insects from the cage immediately after feeding.[14]",
                "Dust food with vitamin D3 and calcium powder. To ensure that your lizard is getting proper nutrients, dust its food once a week or every other week with vitamin D3 and calcium powder.[15]\n\nYou can purchase Rep-Cal Reptile Calcium Powder with D3 online at either PetSmart or Amazon.\nTo dust the insects, place the insects and a little bit of dusting powder in a glass jar and shake until the insects are coated with the powder. Then feed to your lizards immediately.",
                "Change the water regularly. Provide fresh water for your lizard in a shallow dish. Be sure to change the water every day to keep your lizard healthy.\n\n\nIf the water splashes around too much you’ll have to clean the substrate to keep the habitat dry.[16]",
                "Mist the cage. Buy a mist spray bottle and mist your lizard’s cage twice a week. Lizards like to lick water off plants, and misting the plants and vines in your cage will give them extra opportunity to hydrate. Don’t drench the cage as the habitat substrate needs to stay dry. Instead, lightly mist any surfaces that your lizard likes to climb or play on.[17]",
                "Clean the cage. Clean the cage thoroughly once a week. This is an involved procedure that will take some time. You will need rubber gloves, disinfectant, and hot, soapy water for cleaning. You should also check daily for spilled food, feces, or other hazardous particles. [18]\n\nFirst, remove your lizard from the cage and place in a safe spot while you clean.\nRemove all decorations from the cage and clean with hot, soapy water.\nClean the food and water bowls with hot, soapy water. For a homemade cleanser, mix 1 teaspoon (5 ml) dishwashing detergent (such as Palmolive® or Dawn®) and 1 ounce (30 ml) of household bleach into 1 quart of water.[19]\n\nClean cage surfaces with hot, soapy water. Then clean again with a disinfectant. For disinfectant, use a bleach solution containing 1 part bleach to 16 parts water.[20]\n\nLet the cage dry before replacing decorations, food bowls, and the lizard.[21]",
                "Provide proper cage mates. Texas spiny lizards are perfectly happy to be alone in a cage, but if you do decide to have more than one in a cage, make sure you pair them correctly. You should never have two male spiny lizards in the same cage. However, two females will get along well in the same space.[22]\n\nIf you put a male and female together in a cage, they will likely breed.</ref>",
                "Don’t pick up your lizard. Texas spiny lizards should be treated as a display species. They don’t like to be picked up and held. If you hold them for too long and try to play with them they are likely to bite. Only handle your lizard when necessary, such as during cage cleanings.[23]\n\nIf you must pick up the lizard for a cage cleaning, use your palm and fingers to cup the lizard's body from its neck to its cloaca, or neck vent. Then, gentle lift up the lizard in one fluid motion. Do not hold the lizard by its tail as the tail can break off."

        "How to Become a Nurse Practitioner": {
            "intro": "Nurse Practitioners are one of several types of advanced practice nurses who are important partners in the healthcare industry. They blend their clinical expertise in diagnostics and treatment with an emphasis on disease prevention and health management. Often a Nurse Practitioner works alongside a general, family or specialized practice physician to set up and analyze health screenings, diagnose illnesses, and prescribe medications. The Nurse Practitioner also grants doctor referrals and arranges for preventative health as well as manages follow-up appointments. Becoming a Nurse Practitioner requires education and licensing as a Registered Nurse, graduate education and certification.",
            "steps": [
                "Get a high school diploma. Admission into a school of nursing requires a high school diploma or, alternately, passing the General Education Development (GED) test.[1] If you want to be a nurse, pay attention courses like biology, physiology, and chemistry throughout high school. This knowledge will be very important in gaining qualification as a Registered Nurse (RN) and then a Nurse Practitioner (NP).\n\n\nThe foundation of nursing is science. If you don’t like science but find yourself interested in nursing throughout high school, speak with your school counselor about arranging a day or two to shadow a nurse.",
                "Undertake post-secondary education in nursing. There are three ways to become a registered nurse. In all cases, coursework includes physiology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and anatomy.[2]\n\n\nBachelor's degree in nursing (BSN). This level of education is awarded by a college or university and usually takes four years to complete. Class offerings more diverse than other settings and include community health, pharmacology, health assessment, microbiology, human development and clinical practice. A BSN qualifies you for a higher pay grade and a wider variety of certifications and promotions on the job.[3]\n\n\nAssociate's degree in nursing (ADN). This is the most common way to obtain a registered nursing license and involves a two-year program at a community or junior college. Many students transition to BSN programs after having completed an ASN and holding an entry-level nursing position.[4]\n\n\nDiploma from an accredited nursing program. You can also be eligible for licensure by completing a vocational nursing program. These accredited programs are often associated with a hospital and vary in length, though they are typically up to three years long. This education path is on the decline since the National Advisory Council on Nursing Education and Practice recommends that at least 66% of the workforce hold a BSN in nursing or higher.[5][6]",
                "Note that you need a BSN to become a Nurse Practitioner. It is necessary to first become a Registered Nurse with a BSN before you can start a Master's of Science in Nursing (MSN) to become a nurse practitioner. With a diploma or ADN, nurses will be able to move on to their bachelor's degree through accelerated programs and potentially with the assistance of their employers via a tuition reimbursement program.\n\n\nYou may also wish to earn a more advanced degree called Doctorate of Nursing Practice instead of the MSN.",
                "Make sure your school is accredited. The national accreditation agency for nursing schools is the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. This agency ensures the quality and integrity of bachelor, graduate, and residency programs in nursing. Accreditation is voluntary but ensures that colleges and schools providing nursing education are operating at the same professional level and educating future nurses in a manner which ensures that they can provide effective and standardized care.[7]",
                "Get licensed. Registered Nurses in the United States must have a nursing license. Take the National Council Licensure Examination - Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) once you have graduated from your accredited program. This examination is the nationally recognized licensing exam for registered nurses. Prepare for the international equivalent, such as CGFNS International, if you plan to work overseas or if you are an international student planning to work in the United States.[8][9]\n\nPrerequisites to and fees for the exam may differ between states. Check with the requirements for your state, or for the state you plan on practicing in.\nBe aware as well that each state has their own scope of practice for nursing. It is important to know scope of practice so you know what you can or can not do as a nurse in your state.\nMost states have reciprocal agreements, meaning that if you pass your exam in one state, you’ll be able to apply for and receive a license in any other state without retaking the test as long as your license if free from any encumbrances (such as a felony conviction).",
                "Find a job as an RN. Build some experience on the road to becoming a nurse practitioner by seeking entry-level work in a clinic or a hospital setting to get registered nursing experience. There are more than 2 million nurses in the United States, making the profession the largest in the healthcare field. There are a variety of settings in which a nurse can work, including hospitals, physician's offices, elderly care homes, prisons, college campuses and schools.[Image:Become a Nurse Practitioner Step 4.jpg|center]]\n\n\nEntry-level work as an RN usually serves as a stepping-stone to a higher-level career as an advanced practice nurse, like a Nurse Practitioner. You can also work as an RN as you pursue the further education required to become a Nurse Practitioner. There is great flexibility in being able to work as RN while obtaining advanced degree.",
                "Get graduate education in nursing. Most Nurse Practitioners have obtained a Master's Degree of Science in Nursing (MSN). Master's programs are often designed around the needs of a working professional and frequently offer night and weekend classes. A MSN may take between two and seven years to complete, depending upon if the applicant is pursuing the degree full-time or part-time. Make sure to choose a graduate program that has been accredited by either the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC).[10][11][12]\n\nTo be admitted to this graduate program, you will be required to have a Registered Nurse's license, a bachelor’s degree, and a minimum GPA in the bachelor's degree as determined by the prospective school. Applications often require a statement of purpose, personal history or professional history. Applications may also require an interview.\nA MSN degree, particularly one with a Nurse Practitioner concentration, prepares students for careers beyond entry-level and allows them to choose a specialty such as pediatrics, women's health, family care or geriatrics, among other fields.\nBe aware that there is a growing movement to require all Nurse Practitioners to have a Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) degree, or basically a doctoral degree. This degree requires three to four years of further education after a bachelor’s degree in nursing.[13]",
                "Get certified to work as a nurse practitioner. After earning a MSN, take the certification examination administered by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).[14][15]\n\nSpecialties that require certification in addition to licensing include pediatrics, family health, mental health, acute care, diabetes management and school nursing.\nOnce certified, Nurse Practitioners can also choose to take a specialty examination that certifies they have additional knowledge and ability to practice. These specialty certifications include pain management, rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, college health nursing, forensic nursing, diabetes management, nurse executive, pediatrics, and school nursing.",
                "Get a job as a Nurse Practitioner. Nurse practitioners are valued members of the healthcare team, providing cost effective care in the diagnosis, treatment and management of many acute and chronic illnesses. This variety in practice and ability to specialize offers practitioners many options in the work place. Jobs are available in hospitals, private practices, nursing homes, clinics, health departments, urgent care settings, healthcare technology companies, and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), among many other institutions. Different ways of getting a job include consulting online job websites, contacting headhunters in nursing, consulting local hospital job postings, and networking with physicians, nursing managers and community clinics, among other methods.[16]\n\nThe average salary of a NP is is $90,583 and the job outlook for NPs is considered excellent at present. This is because the numbers of primary care physicians is decreasing as the demand for healthcare services is rising thanks to the aging baby boomer generation.\nOther professional opportunities include teaching in schools and universities and working for governmental and military agencies.\nNote as well that about 15% of all Nurse Practitioners have their own private practices. There are also a growing number of nurse-run healthcare centers in the United States in which all healthcare is provided by nurse practitioners and other professionals. Keep in mind that not every state allows this — independent practitioners can only do this if it is within their state's scope of practice.",
                "Understand the nursing profession in general. According to the American Nurses Association, nursing today is designed for the protection, promotion and optimization of health and the prevention of illness and injury. Nurses are advocates in the care of individuals, families and communities.[17] The standardized education of today’s nurses, in contrast to the past, reflects the high expectations communities and physicians have on the men and women who fill these roles.\n\n\nThe nursing profession is not just for women; there are over a hundred thousand registered male nurses working in the US.",
                "Determine if the general responsibilities of nursing interest you. The foundation of all nursing practice is based in human anatomy and physiology. The chief mission of the nursing field is to protect, promote and optimize health. Key responsibilities for nurses include:[18]\n\nPerforming physical examinations and taking medical and family histories.\nProviding counseling and education about health promotion and injury protection.\nAdministering medication and providing wound care.\nCoordinating care and collaborating with other professionals including doctors, therapists and dietitians.\nDirecting and supervising care and providing education to patients and family, which enable patients to be discharged sooner.",
                "Consider the specific job of a Nurse Practitioner. Nurse Practitioners are advanced practice nurses who have obtained graduate education which in turn increases their professional responsibilities. Nurse practitioners can serve in multiple roles, including providing direct care to patients, research in healthcare, consulting and education. Some of their duties can include:[19][20]\n\nUndertaking physical examinations of patients\nProviding immunizations\nDiagnosing and treating common illnesses and injuries\nManaging chronic health problems (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.)\nOrdering and interpret diagnostic tests (e.g., X-rays, EKGs, etc.)\nPrescribing medications and/or therapies\nCounseling patients on lifestyle and healthcare decisions",
                "Know the skills and qualities required of Nurse Practitioners. Beyond having a breadth of knowledge in medicine (and being someone who does not get squeamish easily!), a Nurse Practitioner must also be skilled in other areas. In this sense, nursing is like any other profession in that there are specific individual qualities that make the job easier and a more natural fit for some people. It's important to determine whether your personality and abilities can accommodate the various responsibilities and tasks that come with being a NP. Key qualities include:[21][22]\n\n\nCritical thinking: Nurse Practitioners must be able to assess changes in the health status of their patients from a variety of sources (what the patient says, diagnostic tests, clinical examinations, etc.) and make a quick and evidence-based recommendations.\n\nInterpersonal and communication skills: Being an NP requires working with people everyday—doctors, other nurses, technicians, patients, caregivers, and others. To communicate information and do their jobs effectively and clearly, nurses need strong interpersonal skills, patience, and the ability to break down complex information into something that is accessible for ordinary people (i.e., non-specialists).\n\nCompassion: Caring and empathy are valuable when taking care of individuals who are in sick or injured. Remember that patients may be scared or in pain and need to be comforted, reassured, and motivated to fight through their illnesses.\n\nDetail-oriented and organized: NPs often work with multiple patients and healthcare professional at a time and so they need to be able to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done. In addition, attention to detail is key; one small mistake can have a big impact on a patient’s condition and life.\n\nEffective coping with stress: Nurse Practitioners should be able to cope with stress in effective and healthy ways because they often work in urgent, emergency and/or other sensitive situations and face continual workplace pressures and stressors."

            "intro": "Romantic relationships are not at all necessary to lead a happy life. While some people may find them fulfilling, others are much happier living on their own. Whether you never plan on pursuing a romantic relationship or you're open to it in the future, it's important to focus on living a fulfilling life that makes you happy. Happiness is different for everyone, so take a good look at yourself and decide what it is that fulfills you.",
            "steps": [
                "Visualize your future and set goals. If you want to achieve something, it's important to make the goals concrete. Take some time to reflect on what exactly you want to accomplish in your life and what steps you need to take to get there.[1]\n\nMake sure your goals are things that you can accomplish on your own. Do not, for example, focus your goals around getting married.\nAs you are setting goals for yourself, be sure they are things that you believe will genuinely help you feel fulfilled, not things that you feel are expected of you.\nDon't be afraid to change your plan along the way, as long as you're not giving up on something you still want. Aspirations change over time and that's perfectly fine.\nRemind yourself of your goals when times get tough. Focusing on your end-goal can help you persevere.",
                "Constantly challenge yourself. People often get stuck in life because they get too comfortable. If you want to keep reaching for your dreams, you have to find new challenges for yourself to overcome. This will not only help you achieve more, but it will also keep you more mentally stimulated and fulfilled.[2]\n\nThis may sometimes require making a difficult or \"less safe\" choice, but remind yourself that you need to step outside of your comfort zone at times in order to achieve your goals.",
                "Celebrate your victories. It's important to be your own cheerleader and to never stop being proud of yourself for everything you accomplish. Rewarding yourself will help you feel satisfied about what you have already done and stay motivated to do even more.[3]\n\nTry setting small, very attainable goals for yourself and celebrating each time you meet one. Your reward can be anything you enjoy, from a day at the beach to a party with friends.\nWhen you achieve a larger goal, give yourself a bigger reward, like a great vacation.",
                "Don't forget to live in the moment. Focusing too much on goals can cause people to lose sight of life's little pleasures. While it's great to be have dreams, it's also important to slow down and enjoy what is happening in your life at the moment.[4]\n\nIf you find that you are so wrapped up in work that you are not enjoying life, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities. Working to achieve your goals should increase your happiness, not decrease it.",
                "Be social. People are hard-wired to have relationships with other human beings, so even if you don't have a romantic relationship, it's important to maintain social ones. Keep in contact with friends and family, and try to spend time with other people as much as you can.[5]\n\nYou don't have to be the most extroverted person to enjoy social relationships. Some people enjoy attending frequent parties with lots of people, while others prefer the company of a few close friends. Both are perfectly fine!",
                "Meet new people who share your interests. While it's very important to maintain your existing relationships, it's also helpful to get out there and meet new people. Try joining clubs or groups that are centered around activities you enjoy. This will help you make new friends who share your passions.[6]\n\nNew friends can expand your horizons, which is always a good thing! Don't be afraid to talk to people who are different than you and try new things.",
                "Get a pet. Pets are wonderful companions. They can help keep you active and prevent you from feeling lonely, which is especially important if you live alone. If you don't already have one, consider adopting a cat, a dog, or another pet.[7]\n\nPets make people feel needed because they rely on their owners for basic care. Dogs in particular can add a lot of structure to a person's life because they require regular walking.\nIf you're not willing to commit to owning a pet, offer to walk your neighbor's dog or volunteer at a local animal shelter.",
                "Focus on experiences. New and unique experiences enrich people's lives and help them feel happier overall. Whenever possible, spend your free time trying new things, going new places, and experiencing life.[8]\n\nIf you have a little money set aside to treat yourself, consider investing in an experience, like a vacation, instead of an object. The experience will leave you with great memories that you can look back on for the rest of your life, which will increase your happiness.\nDon't feel like you always need to have someone with you to enjoy these experiences. As a single person, you can choose to have adventures with friends and family or alone.",
                "Try volunteering. Volunteering for a worthy cause greatly increases people's sense of self-worth and fulfillment. Look for an organization in your area that has a mission you believe in and find out how you can help. As a bonus, you may also meet new friends who also care about the cause.[9]\n\nIf you don't have the time to commit to ongoing volunteer work, there are plenty of short-term volunteer opportunities out there. Even a few hours of volunteering is meaningful.",
                "Enjoy physical activity. Many people find that exercise increases their happiness and makes them feel better about themselves. Try finding a type of exercise that you enjoy, whether it's playing a team sport or going for walks.[10]",
                "Spend alone time constructively. It's fine to spend time at home alone, as long as you don't become bored and isolated. To avoid this, use your alone time to cultivate your creative interests or learn new things.[11]\n\nTry taking an online class or developing a new hobby, like painting or sewing.\nAvoid watching too much television, as this can become a stand-in for social relationships.",
                "Take care of yourself. In order to truly be happy, you need to take care of your body and your mind. It's easy to to neglect yourself because of work, family, and other responsibilities, but try to take at least some time every day to nurture yourself and remind yourself how important you are.[12]\n\nTry doing something relaxing, like meditating or getting a massage. This is a great way to unwind and show yourself some love.\nIf you have physical or mental health problems, be sure to get the treatment you need. Ignoring your symptoms will only cause the problem to become worse, and may inhibit you from leading the happy life you deserve.",
                "Don't compare yourself to others. It's tempting to look at other people's lives and imagine that they are much better than your own, but it's important to keep things in perspective. The truth is that you can only see another individual's life from the outside, so it's not really possible to compare your life to theirs. Instead of even trying, focus on all of the positive things in your own life.[13]\n\nSocial media makes it even easier to compare yourself to others. If you feel depressed after looking at your friends' profiles, remind yourself that the pictures they post are just the image they want everyone else to see, and not necessarily what their lives are really like.",
                "Stop beating yourself up. Life doesn't always go as planned, and it's important to learn to accept that. Instead of thinking of yourself as a failure when you don't achieve a goal, use the situation as a learning experience and set a new goal for yourself.[14]\n\nIf you're beating yourself up about your lack of a romantic relationship, remind yourself that there are many other things in your life that make you happy. Let yourself be open to the possibility of having a romantic relationship, but don't stop focusing on your other pursuits.",
                "Stay true to yourself. No matter what happens in life, you must always remember who you are and what you believe in. Think about the values that matter most to you, and make sure that you uphold those values in everything you do.[15]\n\nIf friends try to lead you down a path that does not match your values, find new friends who share your beliefs and accept you for who you are.\nYour career should not force you to abandon your values either. You may be faced with situations that challenge your moral compass, and these are the times to reassert who you are and what you believe in."

        "wikiHow to Touch up Scratches on Your Car": {
            "intro": "Small scratches in the paint of your car can be unsightly, and if left untreated they may result in rusting that can cause serious damage to the body of the vehicle. Repairing scratches in the paint will not only improve the look of the car, but it will prolong the lifespan of the body’s components. First, assess the severity of the scratch, then take corrective action to repair it.",
            "steps": [
                "Assess the depth of the scratch. The proper way to touch up a scratch is best determined by the depth and severity of the scratch. In a well lit area, inspect the scratch. Determine how many layers of paint the scratch has penetrated. If it is just through the clear coat, you may be able to buff it out. If it is down to metal, the process will be different.[1]\n\nLook for signs of bare metal or any rust that may have developed on the scratch.\nScratches in the clear coat can be buffed out, whereas scratches through the paint will need new paint applied.",
                "Purchase the correct color touch up paint. Automotive touch up paint comes in a wide variety of colors, so the best way to find the right replacement paint is to look for the paint code in your car’s owner’s manual. Once you have the paint code, you can purchase touch up paint with the identical code and rest assured that they will match.[2]\n\nHeavily faded vehicle’s may not match with their original paint code, but this shouldn’t be an issue for small touch ups.\nYou may also be able to find your car’s paint code inside the driver’s door on the same panel as the VIN number.",
                "Clean the area around the scratch. Use automotive soap and clean water to wash the scratch and the area immediately surrounding it. Make sure there is no debris or dirt stuck to the scratch. Once done, rinse the area thoroughly.[3]\n\nUse a hose to rinse the entire area and ensure there is no dirt or debris stuck to the car’s paint.\nDry the area completely using a towel, or just wait for it to dry.",
                "Use sandpaper to remove any rust that developed. Use 120 grit sandpaper to sand away any rust that has developed on the paint or metal. Be extremely careful with where you use the sand paper to avoid damaging the surrounding paint unnecessarily.[4]\n\nRemove all rust from the metal before repairing a scratch, otherwise the rust will continue to spread beneath the touch up paint.\nIf the rust has penetrated the metal, that panel will need to be professionally repaired or replaced.",
                "Choose the right conditions to repair it. It is best not to touch up scratches while working in direct sunlight. Instead, find a shady area to work on the vehicle, or choose an overcast day. The shade will allow you to choose how to light the area to best identify and repair the scratches, as well as keeping things like soap from drying on the paint.[5]\n\nAllowing soap to dry on the paint will dull its finish and possibly damage the paint.\nDirect sunlight could make the metal on the car hot, which isn’t optimal for applying touch up paint.",
                "Apply automotive primer to any bare metal. If the scratch has penetrated all the layers of paint down to bare metal, it’s important to add a layer of primer. The primer will prevent rust from developing beneath the surface of the paint, as well as providing a good surface to apply the touch up paint to.[6]\n\nUse a small brush to apply a thin layer of primer to any exposed paint.\nBe sure to apply the primer to any metal you sanded rust off of.",
                "Add a coat of paint to the scratch. Allow the primer to dry completely. Then, take your automotive paint and apply a layer of it over the area you painted with primer. If the scratch is fairly small, try dabbing the paint onto the scratch and allowing it to spread and settle on its own.[7]\n\nDabbing the paint often yields the flattest finished product. A toothpick may work for thinner scratches.\nMost automotive touch up paints will not require multiple layers.",
                "Put a layer of clear coat of the dry paint. Once the primer and the touch up paint have both dried, you may want to add a layer of clear coat. Because most clear coat comes in a spray can, it’s important that you take steps to prevent over-spray, or accidentally applying clear coat to areas you didn’t intend to. To prevent this, cut a hole through a piece of cardboard and hold it between the can of clear coat and the scratch, then use the cardboard to help direct the flow of the clear coat spray.[8]\n\nUnlike a nozzle, the hole in the cardboard will allow the clear coat to mist onto the surface of the paint, rather than striking it as a jet and dripping.\nImmediately dab up any dripping clear coat with a clean rag.",
                "Use rubbing compound to make the area shine. Ensure the clear coat is completely dry, then apply some polishing compound to the area. Use a polishing wheel to polish the paint with the compound, in order to ensure it appears uniform with the rest of the car’s body.[9]\n\nThe rubbing compound will remove any small gaps in the paint and create a more professional finish.\nStop polishing the area when the shiny paint is revealed by the polishing wheel.",
                "Wash and wax the car. Rinse the car, then use a bucket of water mixed with automotive soap to wash the entire car. Once done, rinse and dry it, and apply a layer of automotive wax to the entire vehicle so there is a uniform shine to all of the paint.[10]\n\nThe polishing process can remove some of the protective clear coat over your paint, so applying wax adds a layer of protection for your paint.",
                "Clean any dirt away from the scratch. Scratches in the clear coat can be repaired without adding any additional paint. Before you can get started, wash and dry the area around the scratch to make sure there’s no dirt or debris that could result in new scratches during the repair process.[11]\n\nBits of dirt could cause additional scratches in the clear coat as you buff the scratch out.\nMake sure the paint is dry if the scratch remover you purchased requires dry paint.",
                "Buff the sanded area with scratch remover. Apply a small amount of scratch removing compound to a buffing pad and apply it to the scratched area in a circular motion. Continue to rub the compound into the scratch firmly until the compound is dry.[12]\n\nRead the instructions on the scratch remover your purchase, as some will have variations in their application methods.\nYou can purchase scratch remover at your local auto parts store.",
                "Clean away any excess scratch remover compound. Once done, use a clean rag to wipe away any excess scratch remover compound that remains on the paint. There will likely be a build of the compound around the outside edges of the portion you treated.[13]\n\nMake sure you to wipe the compound away completely.",
                "Wash and wax the vehicle. Fill a bucket with water and a small amount of automotive soap. Then rinse entire vehicle paying close attention to the area you just repaired. Wash the entire car thoroughly, then wax the car. Waxing the entire car will ensure an even finish to the paint.[14]\n\nOnce the wax is dry, buff it off with a microfiber towel.\nThe repaired scratch should be invisible once the wax is buffed off."

        "wikiHow to Help Someone Overcome the Loss of a Relative": {
            "intro": "Grief is something that eventually strikes us all, and we rely on support from friends to make it through. Being a patient listener, staying reliable and making good on offers to help out are the best ways to be there for someone who is dealing with loss. While there's nothing you can do to speed the mourning process along, you can be the bright light that helps your friend get through the darkest times. See Step 1 and beyond to learn what to say and do.",
            "steps": [
                "Acknowledge what happened. Death is not easy to talk about, and many people have trouble bringing up the subject. But avoiding the topic because it makes you uncomfortable isn't going to help out your friend. You may think that talking about other topics will be a good distraction, but your grieving friend won't find it easy to laugh at jokes or talk about random subjects. Ignoring the biggest issue in your friend's life is not the way to support him or her, so be brave enough to bring up the topic instead of awkwardly acting like it didn't happen.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to say the word \"died.\" Don't say \"I heard what happened.\" Say \"I heard the news that your grandmother died.\" When you say what's true, even if it's painful, you're showing your friend that you're willing to talk about the hard things in life. Your friend needs someone who gets it and is capable of going there.\nName the person who died. Saying the person's name might cause tears to come, but it will help your friend to know the person who died still matters to other people.",
                "Express concern. Tell your friend how sorry you are about the fact that his or her relative died. Telling your friend that you're sorry and you love him or her will help your friend feel comforted. Giving your friend a hug or touching him or her on the shoulder can also help communicate your sorrow for what your friend is going through. Say the words \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\nIf you knew the person who has passed away, share memories of that person with your friend, and list the good qualities of that person. Remembering the good of that person can help your friend feel a bit better about the loss they're enduring.\nIf you and your friend are religious, offer to pray for him/her and his/her family. If they are not religious, say that you are thinking of them and are deeply sorry for their loss.",
                "Be genuine. Since death is so hard to talk about, it can be difficult to express your true feelings to your friend. But using one of the dozens of cliches people say to make talking about death easier isn't actually going to be very helpful. If you tell your friend your honest feelings, you'll sound more sincere, and your friend will be more likely to turn to you when he or she needs someone to listen.\n\n\nAvoid saying things like \"She's in a better place,\" or \"She'd want you to be happy right now.\" You don't actually know that, do you? Hearing these empty statements isn't very helpful.\nIf you're having trouble putting your feelings into words, it's ok to say something along the lines of \"I just don't know what to say. I can't express how sorry I am.\"",
                "Ask how the person is feeling. You might assume this would be a common question, but many people are a little afraid to ask or just don't want to deal with the answer. When your friend is at work or with acquaintances, he or she probably has to pretend like everything's ok. That's why as the person's friend, giving him or her the space to talk can be really helpful. You'll need to be ready to accept your friend's answer, even if it's difficult to hear.\n\n\nSome people might not want to be asked how they're feeling. If your friend doesn't seem to want to talk about it, don't push him or her to say more.\nIf your friend does decide to open up, encourage him or her to talk for as long as it helps. Don't try to change the subject, or inject cheer into the conversation; just let the person be expressive and release all the emotions he or she normally has to hold back.",
                "Don't judge. Let the person be himself, no matter what that means. Everyone has different responses to losing a relative, and there's really no right or wrong way to feel. Even if your friend is having a reaction you don't think you would have, it's important to allow the person to express his or her feelings without your judgement.\n\n\nBe prepared to get to know your friend in a deeper way, and see him or her act in ways you may not be used to. Despair and grief can erupt in many different ways. Your friend might feel denial, anger, numbness, and a million other emotions in response to his or her grief.",
                "Don't say \"time heals\". Time might take away the initial sting, but when a close relative dies, life will never be the same. The idea that time heals makes it seem like there's a deadline after which people should feel \"normal\" again, but for many people that will never happen. Instead of focusing on helping the person \"get over\" his or her grief, focus on being a source of support and joy in that person's life. Never pressure your friend to mourn more quickly.[1]\n\nForget the \"five stages of grief.\" There is no actual timeline for grief, and everyone handles it differently. While thinking about grief as a series of stages might be helpful to some, for many people it simply doesn't apply. Don't hold your friend to any kind of timeline.",
                "Don't say \"you're so brave\". This common sentiment sounds caring, but it can make people who are grieving feel worse. That's because calling someone brave makes it seem as though you expect them to stand tall even while they're suffering. When someone has lost a relative, they may have times when they stumble and fall. A good friend like yourself shouldn't expect someone to act courageous all the time when his or her world has just been turned upside down.[2]",
                "Handle tears with grace. People are very vulnerable when they cry. Your reaction when your friend breaks down in tears can either be really helpful or extremely harmful. The best way to handle tears is with acceptance and love, rather than awkwardness or disgust. Know that your friend is going to cry from time to time, and be prepared to handle his or her tears in a positive, helpful way instead of making him or her feel worse.\n\n\nThink ahead about how you'll react if your friend cries when you're together. Prepare to give him or her a hug, continue making eye contact, and stay for as long as necessary.\nLeaving the room, looking away, making a joke or somehow cutting off the conversation can leave the person feeling embarrassed that he or she cried.",
                "Answer your messages. Being reliable is more important than ever when your friend is going through the loss of a relative. Answering or returning phone calls is a big deal. Make sure to return texts and respond to messages of any kind when your friend is going through a period of mourning. If you tend to be on the flaky side in this arena, make an extra effort to be present for your friend.",
                "Help out. Ask your friend how you can help make things easier during the first few months after his or her relative died. Don't just say \"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help\"; many people will say those words, and they usually don't really intend to get involved. If you really want to make a difference, ask for concrete things you can start doing to make life a little easier for your friend and his or her family. Here are a few things you could do:\n\n\nMake food or bring food to your friend and his/her family. Or, if you're challenged by the kitchen, you could bring them nice carry-out.\nGive people rides\nDo household chores\nTake care of the person's pets\nGet the person's homework assignments\nMake phone calls to inform people about the person's loss",
                "Find little ways to be thoughtful. A good way to express your support for your friend is to show your friend you're thinking about him or her. Go above and beyond to be thoughtful more often than you normally would. The small ways in which you show your friend you care can be as meaningful as having a big heart-to-heart conversation. Try doing the following:\n\n\nMake cookies or bake a cake\n\nTake the person out to the movies or go for a walk in the park\nSend a thoughtful card in the mail\nEmail the person more often\nInclude the person in more social activities\nGive the person gifts every once in a while",
                "Be patient and understanding. Your friend might not be the same for a long time. He or she might seem sad, distracted or a little less energetic for months or even years after a close relative passes away. Being a good friend means staying in the friendship even when someone goes through big changes, and if you love your friend, you won't expect him or her to \"bounce back\" - you'll go along for the ride.\n\n\nDon't pressure your friend to do activities he or she no longer finds fun.\nUnderstand that your friend might go through serious problems after the loss of a relative. Sometimes people turn to addictive behaviors or experience major depression as a result of grief and trauma. If you're worried that your friend might harm him or herself, help your friend get help.[3]",
                "Be a steady presence. After a few months, most people will get wrapped up in their own busy lives and stop thinking about your friend's loss. But your friend will need support for more than just a few months after losing a close relative. Be there for your friend for as long as he or she needs a little extra help and care.\n\n\nCheck in on the anniversary of your friend's relative's death. Ask your friend how he or she is doing.\nThe best thing you can do for your friend is just to be there. If they call, talk or set up plans. If they don't, send a card saying you're thinking of them. It's best to let them grieve while you offer your embrace and your love."

        "How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Women)": {
            "intro": "Chlamydia is a dangerous yet common and curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Unfortunately, 75% of women infected with chlamydia do not show symptoms, until complications have already occurred. In order to get timely treatment, therefore, it is essential for women to understand and be able to recognize the symptoms of chlamydia when they do occur in order to get treated promptly.",
            "steps": [
                "Note vaginal discharge. If you experience unusual vaginal discharge, this may be a sign of chlamydia infection or another STI.[1]\n\nSigns that vaginal discharge is abnormal may include a different or unpleasant smell, a darker color, or a texture you've never experienced before.\nIf you suspect that your vaginal discharge is abnormal, consult your doctor, gynaecologist, or other health professional for testing and treatment.\nBloody discharge between periods can also be a sign of chlamydia.[2]",
                "Pay attention to pain. Pain during urination and/or pain during intercourse could be a sign of a chlamydia infection.[3]\n\nIf you experience pain or extreme discomfort during sex, refrain from intercourse until you can be examined by a health professional. Chlamydia infections can cause pain during vaginal intercourse for some women.\nBurning pain during urination usually indicates some sort of infection, from a yeast infection to an STI. Seek medical treatment at once.",
                "Check for bleeding after sexual intercourse. Some women experience minor bleeding after vaginal intercourse, and this symptom is sometimes associated with female chlamydia.[4]",
                "Tell your doctor about rectal pain, bleeding, or discharge. Bleeding, pain, and/or discharge from the rectum are symptoms of chlamydia. If you have vaginal chlamydia, the infection could have spread to the anus. If you engage in anal sex, the infection could be based in the rectum.[5]",
                "Watch for mild and slowly progressing lower back, abdominal, and pelvic aches. Women may also experience higher back pain similar to kidney tenderness. These aches may indicate that a chlamydia infection has spread from the cervix to the fallopian tubes.[6]\n\nAs the chlamydia progresses, your lower abdomen may be tender to gentle pressure.",
                "Seek help for a sore throat. If you have a sore throat and have recently engaged in oral sex, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner in this way, even if he was without symptoms.\n\n\nPenis-to-mouth transmission of chlamydia is one of the possible means of transmission of this infection.",
                "Monitor nausea and fevers. Women with chlamydia will often develop a fever and become nauseated, particularly if the infection has already spread to the fallopian tubes.[7]\n\nAnything higher than 37.3C or 99F is considered a fever.",
                "Know your risks for chlamydia. If you have oral, vaginal, or anal sex and have multiple partners and/or unprotected sex, you are at risk of contracting chlamydia. Chlamydia is transmitted when the bacteria ‘’Chlamydia trachomatis’’ comes in contact with your mucous membranes. Anyone who is sexually active should get annual STI tests, including testing for chlamydia.[8] You should also get tested after every new sexual partner.\n\n\nYou are at higher risk for chlamydia if you have unprotected sex, as your partner might have chlamydia or another STI. These infections can be prevented by using latex condoms and dental dams.\nYou are at higher risk if you have been diagnosed with other STIs.\nYounger people are at a higher risk of contracting chlamydia.\nSince men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of getting chlamydia, be sure to talk to your male partner and make sure your partner is not having sex with anyone other than you.\nMouth-to-vagina and mouth-to-anus transmission is not known to occur. Mouth-to-penis and penis-to-mouth transmission is definitely possible, though transmission through oral sex is less likely than via vaginal or anal sex.",
                "Get tested before symptoms occur. Chlamydia does not cause symptoms in 75% of infected women. Chlamydia could be damaging your body even if you haven't experienced any symptoms. Untreated infections cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can eventually lead to scarring and infertility.[9]\n\nWhen symptoms do occur, they usually arise 1-3 weeks after infection.\nGet tested immediately if your partner discloses that he has chlamydia.",
                "Have one of two types of tests. A swab from an infected genital area can be taken and analyzed. For women, this means a swab of your cervix, vagina, or rectum and, for your male partner, a swab is inserted into the tip of the urethra or rectum. A urine sample may also be taken.[10]\n\nAsk your doctor or visit a local health clinic, Planned Parenthood, or other agency that offers STI testing. In many cases testing is free.[11]",
                "Get treated immediately. If you do get diagnosed with chlamydia, treatment via oral antibiotics, particularly azithromycin and doxycycline, will be offered to you. If you take the full course of antibiotics as directed, the infection should be gone in a week or two. For more advanced chlamydia, you may need IV antibiotics.\n\n\nIf you have chlamydia, your partner should also be tested and on treatment so you can avoid re-infecting each other. All sex should be put on hold until treatment is finished.\nMany people with chlamydia also have gonorrhea, so your doctor may put you on treatment for this infection as well. The cost of treating gonorrhea is cheaper than running the lab tests for it, so you might be put on this treatment without being tested.[12]"

        "wikiHow to Know if He's Really Into You": {
            "intro": "Do you have a crush on an amazing guy and wonder if he feels the same way? If so, then don't worry -- help is on the way. If you want to know if he's really into you, then you have to pay close attention to what he does, what he says, and how he acts around you. As long as you do this without being too obvious about it, you'll soon be on your way to knowing how he really feels. See Step 1 to get started and to find out how your crush really feels today.",
            "steps": [
                "Watch his body language. Body language can often give a guy's true feelings away -- no matter how hard he tries to hide them. Though body language tricks don't always tell you exactly how a guy feels, they can definitely predict whether or not he views you in a romantic light. Here are some signs that may mean he's really into you:\n\n\nHe turns his hips toward you even if he's facing the other direction.\nHe will look up at you, smile, and look back down.\nIf he catches you looking at him, he'll smile.\nHe never puts his hands in his pockets or crosses his arms while talking to you.\nHe may lean toward you when he speaks.\nHe may turn his feet toward you. If he turns them away from you when you're sitting down next to each other, then he may not be interested.\nHe may accidentally brush up against you when you're talking, or touch you lightly with his hands.",
                "Notice when he goes out of his way for you. If he takes a longer route to class just to walk past you, or if he offers to walk you to a class that's nowhere near his next one, he probably likes you. He may even make excuses for why he's suddenly near you, like asking to borrow a book you know he owns. This will be his way of letting you know he wants to spend more time around you.\n\n\nSee if he offers you a ride home though he lives on the other side of town.\nSee if he waits around, seemingly for no reason, until you show up.",
                "Notice if he treats you differently from his friends. The bigger the difference, the bigger your advantage. For example, he might burp or swear in front of his friends, but try really hard not to do those things around you. If he's trying to be on his best behavior, he might like you. If he thinks of you as \"one of the guys,\" then he may not try to act super refined around you.\n\n\nIf he treats you just like a pal, cursing, belching, and telling you about the people he has crushes on, then you may have entered the \"Friend Zone.\"",
                "See if he's nice to your friends. If you're hanging out with your friends and the guy comes along, pay attention to how he treats them. If he's into you, then he'll want to make a strong impression on your friends so that they'll tell you how awesome he is. Guys know that girls like to talk, and if he likes you, he'll be smart enough not to give your friends the cold shoulder. The next time he goes up to you and your friends, see if he becomes extra courteous to them and goes out of his way to be nice to them.\n\n\nThe same goes for your family members. If he sees you around your mom or siblings and tries extra hard to be nice, he may be doing it because he likes you.",
                "See if he wants you to meet his friends. If he's into you, then he'll want to show you off. If he's secretive about going off to meet his friends, then it may be because he likes just having guy time -- or because he likes guy time because it lets him hit on the ladies. But if he does want to introduce you to his friends, it's a great sign. It means that he wants to show you off -- and that he doesn't think you'll get in the way of any potential womanizing.\n\n\nThere is one exception to this rule, however: he may not want you to meet his friends because he’s too embarrassed of them!",
                "See if he's always doing you favors. If he's into you, then he'll go out of his way to do nice things for you. He may pick up lunch for you when you're having a busy day, he may get the homework assignments for you if you're sick from school, or he may give you a ride when you need one. Think about it: is he just a really nice guy, or is his behavior toward you suggesting something more? If he's always doing nice things for you and doesn't seem to be picking up lunch for anyone else, then chances are it's because he's really into you.\n\n\nHe may even text you asking if he can help you with something small just as an excuse to talk to you. If he tries to spend as much time around you as possible, even if it’s through helping you out, then he’s definitely into you.",
                "See if he always ends up by your side in group settings. The next time you hang out with the guy and a bunch of your friends, see if he naturally ends up gravitating toward you. If it feels like he's always by your side in these group scenarios, then it's probably because he's into you. Otherwise, why else would he talk to you instead of his buddies or the other girls around?\n\n\nIt may not happen immediately, but if you find that you two always end up having long conversations at the end of the night or sitting down next to each other when the whole gang goes out to happy hour, then this may be a sign that he's really into you.",
                "See how he acts around other girls. This can be a big indication of how he really feels about you. If he's really just a big flirt, then he'll be treating every girl the way he treats you. If he teases, flirts, plays around with, compliments, and gives a ton of attention to every girl that comes his way along with you, then yeah, he may not be singling you out. But if you're the only girl he's flirty with -- or the only girl he's more reserved with -- then it may be a sign that he's into you. He may actually like you and can therefore feel too shy to really flirt with you instead of other girls he doesn't really care for.\n\n\nThis can be confusing, but it makes a lot of sense. The main thing is to figure out if he treats you differently from the other girls.",
                "See what he does when you're apart. When you're out of sight, are you also out of mind? If you and the guy don't see each other for a while and he doesn’t check in at all, then you may not be on his mind. But if you find him texting you, calling you, or just popping in to say hi when you haven’t hung out in a while, then he may be really into you. The same goes for social media – if he comments on your Facebook posts or favorites your Tweets a lot, then this may be his way of letting you know he cares.\n\n\nIf you’re online, see if he tries to chat you on gchat or Facebook to catch up. This can be another sign that he wants something more from your relationship.",
                "Notice the types of things you do together. Another way to see if he’s really into you is to see if you’ve already been going on dates without knowing it. If a lot of your hang outs are already intimate and date like, then this may mean that he’s really into you. Here are some things to look out for:\n\n\nDo you go on coffee or lunch dates? If he meets up with you during the day, not after he’s had a few drinks with his buddies, then he may see you as relationship material.\nDo you hang out solo a lot? Do you go to the movies? Go for walks? Just watch TV together? Then guess what – you may already be going on dates without knowing it.\nDoes he plan hanging out with you days in advance? If so, then he’s really serious about making sure he spends time with you.",
                "See if he tries to impress you. If he’s really into you, then he may try to show off around you and to let you know how awesome, capable, and brave he is. This may be somewhat outdated and does not apply to all guys, but it may be the case that he’ll try to steal the show if you’re around just to make sure he catches your eye. When he’s doing these things, see if he’s looking over to see if you’re watching. Here are some things he may do in front of you:\n\n\nCasually start showing off a talent, like dribbling a basketball or a soccer ball.\nConveniently pick up a guitar and start strumming.\nJump off tall structures into water to show you how brave he is.\nChallenge his friends to friendly fights or contests.",
                "See if he laughs extra hard around you. Of course, you may be the next Sarah Silverman, but if he laughs around you all the time, it can also just mean that he’s laughing because he’s into you and is naturally a little nervous around you. If he laughs more than normal at your jokes, or even laughs a little bit at regular comments that aren’t even all that funny, then this may be a sure-fire sign that he likes you.\n\n\nThe next time you’re together, pay attention to how much he laughs. Try to notice him with others – does he always laugh so much, or does his laughter seem to be more intense around you?",
                "See if he acts nervous around you. This is a no-brainer. If he’s really into you, then he may be more nervous than normal because he’ll be afraid of messing up. He may laugh more, sure, but he may also stutter, forget what he was going to say, ask you the same question twice within ten minutes, repeat himself, trip over himself for no reason, or just generally act nervous and adorable because he really cares what you think of him.\n\n\nThe next time you’re around him, pay attention. Does he fidget? Does it take him a while to ask a question? Does he make self-deprecating comments? If so, then it may be because he likes you and doesn’t quite know how to act.",
                "See if you catch him looking at you. This is another big one. If you have a class together or if you happen to be in the same place, see if you can catch him looking at you. This is another sure-fire way to see if he has feelings for you. The only problem is, if you try to catch him staring at you all the time, then he may think that you have a crush on him…which you do! But if you can be discreet about it, try to see if he’s looking at you the next time you’re near each other.\n\n\nIf he catches you catching him staring and blushes and looks down at the floor, then this is an extra sign that he’s into you.",
                "See if he starts preening around you. If he’s into you, then it’s only natural that he cares more about what he looks like when he’s around you. You may catch him doing some of the following things when you’re together:\n\n\nRunning his hands through his hair\nTrying to straighten his clothes or remove any stains on them\nDiscreetly checking himself out in reflections",
                "Pay attention to how he talks to you. If a guy calls you by your nickname, comes up with a new nickname for you, or refers to you by a pet name, this is a big sign. Anything he says that makes you feel special and that shows he's taken a unique interest in you can tell you that he's really into you.\n\n\nAlso watch for him saying your name more often than he absolutely needs to.\nSee if he talks slowly and more softly when he addresses you. This means that he's letting his guard down because he likes you.\nSee if he makes eye contact when he talks to you. Though he may look away occasionally, eye contact shows that he's paying attention to you.",
                "See how long it takes him to talk to you. When you know he's in the same room with other people, pretend you don't notice he's there. See how long it takes him to spot you and how long it takes him to come over and say hi. Less than a few minutes means he's probably interested. However, if it takes him a bit longer to say hi to you, it may just be because he's really shy.\n\n\nYou can also try to see how he reacts when you enter the room. Does his entire face light up, or does he barely change his expression?",
                "See if he puts down other guys in front of you. Anytime you hear him say anything negative about a guy, it means that he sees this guy as a threat — especially if it's another guy you know well. He clearly wants you to only pay attention to him, not anyone else. If you mention a guy friend to him and he immediately acts suspicious, it may be because he thinks you may have romantic feelings for the other guy.\n\n\nIf he knows you're going on dates and often says things like, \"That guy isn't good enough for you,\" then he may just be saying that he thinks that he is good enough.\nHe may also tease you about liking other guys you're just friends with. This could be another way for him to show that he's thinking of you romantically.",
                "See if he's always teasing you. If he's really into you, then he'll be more likely to tease you all the time. You may think he's just being mean or making fun of you, but if you find that he's giving you special treatment and always teasing you, it may not be because he thinks of you as his kid sister. If you find that he's poking you in the ribs, giving you a silly nickname, playfully making fun of your outfits, or otherwise generally teasing you, then it probably means that he's really into you. Why else would he make the effort?\n\n\nTeasing is a big part of flirting. You may not even realize that he thinks he's flirting with you when he's being playful.",
                "See what he says to you about other girls. This can be a big indication of whether or not he's really into you. He could be bragging about all of his womanizing in an effort to impress you, when he really just wants you to chase after him. He could also be telling you that he just can't find the right girl because he really just wants to be with you. If you find him even saying that no girl he meets is as good/interesting/cool/pretty as you, then yeah, he's basically telling you that he wants to date you.\n\n\nIf he constantly says things like, “I can just never find the right girl…” then this may be his way of telling you that this girl is standing right in front of him.",
                "See if he really opens up to you. If the guy is really into you, then he may start opening up to you and treating you as more than just a casual friend. (Just make sure this doesn’t mean he just sees you as a best friend, though.) If he wants to take things to the next level, then he may begin to tell you things that he wouldn’t tell just anyone. Here are some things he may talk about with you if he’s interested in you:\n\n\nHis childhood\nHis hopes for the future\nHis relationships with his family or friends\nSome of his secretly dorky hobbies\nAnything that comes after, “I’ve never told anyone this before…”",
                "Make sure you ask him yourself. At the end of the day, the best way to really know if he’s into you is just to ask him. Don’t ask his friends, don’t ask your friends to ask him for you, don’t ask him in a note or a text, but be brave and venture out and ask him yourself. If he’s too shy to do anything, then your potential future relationship is in your hands. It’s not as scary as it sounds.",
                "Find the best place and time to ask him. It doesn’t have to be the most perfect, magical place, but pick a place where you can have some privacy without either of your friends around and a time when he’s not likely to be stressed or to rush off somewhere. If you want to up the romance factor, you can ask him in the evenings or at a place that is special to you both.",
                "Just come right out and say it. Make some small talk but then ask him how he feels about you. You can tell him that you’ve developed feelings for him and just really want to know where his head is. Make eye contact, but don’t put the pressure on. Try to keep it cool and ask him how he feels without putting the pressure on.",
                "React appropriately. If it turns out he likes you, then you can privately celebrate. You can both decide where to go from here. And if not, it’s not the end of the world, and you don’t have to torture yourself by wondering what he’s really thinking anymore. Be proud of yourself for being brave enough to ask him and move forward."

        "How to Overcome Ophthalmophobia": {
            "intro": "Ophthalmophobia is the fear of being watched or stared at. It is not a common fear, but it can be severe for those who suffer from it. If it is not addressed, it can potentially lead to more serious struggles with anxiety. If you suffer from ophthalmophobia, there is hope. Start by exposing yourself to your fear regularly to lessen the effect of the phobia. Work on confronting the irrational thoughts driving your fear. If you're struggling to overcome your phobia, seek out professional counseling to better manage your anxiety and take control of your life.",
            "steps": [
                "Teach yourself some relaxation exercises. Before you start exposing yourself to your fears, you will need to establish some ways to handle the anxiety that exposing yourself to your fears may cause. Otherwise, facing your fears can be traumatic.[1] A good way to handle the anxiety you may feel is to teach yourself to use one or more relaxation techniques. Then, when you are feeling anxious, you can calm yourself down by using one of these techniques. Some good techniques include:\n\n\nDeep breathing\nProgressive muscle relaxation\nMeditation",
                "Make a list of what triggers your fear. If you want to overcome a phobia, you need to expose yourself to your fear in small increments. To start this process, think about what triggers your fear. You can use this list later to work on gradually exposing yourself to your triggers until they lose their power.[2]\n\nYour list should include the obvious. You are likely afraid of a stranger staring at you in public, acting in a way that calls attention to yourself, and being watched during your day-to-day life.\nIn addition to the obvious, try to think outside the box. Are there any subtle triggers that fuel your phobia? For example, do you feel frightened when you are watching TV and an actor looks into the camera? Do you get anxious when you have to walk past a large group of people? Do you feel nervous if you make eye contact during casual conversation?",
                "Rank your list. Once you've made your list, rank your fears. This will help you know when to start when it comes to exposing yourself to your phobia and your triggers. Try to think about what fears affect you the most. Maybe having a stranger stare at you on public transportation produces the most intense anxiety for you. You can place this fear near the top of your list. Eye contact with a close friend, while it causes you some unease, may not produce as acute of an anxious reaction. You can place this fear near the bottom of your list.[3]",
                "Start with small exposures. Once your ranked list is ready, you can begin gradually exposing yourself to your fears. Make sure that you start small. Begin by exposing yourself to the items on your list that produce the least anxiety.[4]\n\nFor example, you could look into a mirror and practice staring at yourself before you interact with another person. This is great practice and often less intense than exposing yourself to someone else staring at you.\nIf you sometimes feel nervous looking at pictures of people who are looking directly into the camera, then go on Facebook or do a Google image search until you find a picture of someone looking directly into a camera. Stare at this image until you no longer feel nervous.\nKeep in mind that it may be difficult to intentionally expose yourself to an anxiety-producing stimuli, but it's important you do so. The longer you expose yourself to a fear, the less power that fear will have over you.\nRemember to use a relaxation technique to calm yourself down if you start to feel anxious. The items that are lower on your list may not cause you too much anxiety, but it is important to calm yourself down even if you are a little anxious.",
                "Work your way up your list. Once you've exposed yourself to a few items on the bottom of your list, work your way up. Put yourself in situations that make you feel uncomfortable, and try to stay in these situations long enough so you can practice being in that situation multiple times. Practice each new situation until you feel like you are used to the feeling of being in that situation.[5] The idea is to keep practicing until you move from feeling uncomfortable to feeling comfortable with the situation.\n\n\nMaybe public transportation is a big trigger for you. When riding a train or bus, you get the unshakeable feeling you are being watched, judged or stared at. Force yourself to take the train to work a few mornings instead of driving.\nYou may have an inclination to hide yourself due to your phobia. You may, for example, wear sunglasses or hide your face with a book. Resist these inclinations. Try to simply sit and relax. Listen to music on your iPod and look out the window. While you may feel intense fear at first, if you regularly expose yourself to these situations, that fear will gradually taper off.\nMake sure that you use a relaxation technique to calm yourself down if you become anxious.",
                "Practice regularly. Consistency is key when it comes to overcoming any phobia. You need to practice regularly. Work on exposing yourself to each situation on your list multiple times per week. The more your practice, the faster you'll eliminate your anxiety.[6]\n\nWhile you should practice regularly, do so at your own pace. If you're still experiencing some anxiety looking at photos of people staring at a camera, do not hop on public transportation. If you push yourself too hard, things could backfire. Allow yourself to progress gradually.",
                "Write down and examine your thoughts. Phobias are by nature irrational. Sometimes, acknowledging your irrationality by writing it down can help. By writing down your thoughts, you may be able to reduce the effects of ophthalmophobia.\n\n\nMake a mood log. Write down when you feel anxious, depressed, or scared due to your phobia. You should also record the thoughts fueling this fear or anxiety. For example, you could write something like, \"Saw someone glance at me on the train and felt intense anxiety. I was worried they were watching me because I was doing something foolish, or they were planning on following me.\"\nAt the end of the day, reread your journal and examine your thoughts. Did you have any reason to believe you had done something foolish or embarrassing? Were there other people staring? Probably not. In all likelihood, the person on the train accidentally glanced at you, or was looking at something just next to you or just beside you.",
                "Find ways to distract yourself. Distraction can be very helpful to cope with troublesome thoughts in the moment. It can take a while to completely overcome a phobia. If you're not in a situation where you can immediately examine and deconstruct your fears, have a distraction on hand to help you avoid feeling panicked or anxious.[7]\n\nWhen you're in a situation where you're likely to experience fear, make sure you have something on hand. Bring a crossword puzzle or a book with you on public transportation. Bring a journal where you can jot down random lists, like list of names that start with \"A.\"\nIf you're ruminating on anxious thoughts at home, engage in some kind of hobby. Bake a batch of cookies or do a vigorous workout to curb your anxiety.",
                "Examine your fear to see if it has a deeper implication. Sometimes, phobias stem from a deep underlying fear or personal issue that's being ignored. Spend some time considering whether your fear of being stared at or watched stems from a deeper place. If it does, you may want to consult a professional to help you better address this fear.[8]\n\nReview your day-to-day life and think about situations where you feel fear. Are these situations indicative of a greater insecurity? Look into your past as well. How long have you had this phobia? Were there any events that occurred around the time the phobia developed that could have caused it?\nFor example, maybe you tend to feel most anxious about being watched or stared at when out at a bar or a social setting. Maybe you were once harassed or confronted in a bar by a rude or aggressive stranger. Since then, you may have become increasingly fearful of being watched or stared at, as you believe this a sign of potential aggression.",
                "Challenge irrational thoughts. When you find yourself engaging in phobia-based thinking, pause to challenge your thoughts. Phobias are irrational, and you should work to make yourself better aware of that irrationality in the moment.[9]\n\nAsk yourself if there's any evidence when you find yourself thinking irrational thoughts. For example, you may see someone staring and think, \"I've made of a fool of myself. That's why they're staring. Everyone is going to judge me for this.\" Stop and ask if this is rational. Are you actually doing anything to call attention to yourself? Is anyone else staring?\nThink about whether there's anything you can do to resolve a situation. For example, say someone is staring at you in a bar. On the off chance this person is dangerous or aggressive, you could ask a friend to stay by your side. You could also talk to the bartender in the event the person began to harass you. You are reasonably safe in this situation, and there are ways to get out of it quickly.\nKeep in mind that some people stare for positive reasons, such as because they find someone attractive or interesting. For example, someone might stare at you because you are wearing a cool outfit, or because you have a unique hairstyle. Try to consider the positive reasons someone might have for staring at you.\nTry to disengage from the situation. Imagine a friend is having the same fears as you. What would you say to this friend? You would probably tell that friend they're being irrational. Try to do the same for yourself.",
                "Notice that you are okay. When you're having a fearful reaction, it can be helpful to stop and remind yourself that you are okay. While phobias can be frightening, they are rarely based in reality. When you're in a moment of panic, remember you are okay.[10]\n\nIn dull moments, remind yourself that you're okay. When you're doing the dishes, for example, say to yourself, \"I am okay right now. I am safe right now.\"\nWhen you find yourself beginning to panic, remember the moments when you were okay and safe. Try to think to yourself, \"I am still okay. I am still safe.\"\nIt can help to take a few deep breaths, as this can slow down the mind and encourage feelings of relaxation.",
                "Make an appointment with a therapist. Sometimes, phobias can become unmanageable. A phobia like ophthalmophobia, which is often triggered in social situations, can become particularly limiting. You may be afraid to leave your home or become antisocial for fear of being stared at or watched. If your phobia has become intense, to the point it's affecting your ability to function, seek out the help of a qualified therapist.[11]\n\nYou can find a therapist through your insurance or by asking your regular doctor for a referral. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.\nPhobias are often treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of therapy where you confront and examine irrational thoughts and behaviors. In some cases, antidepressants may help you deal with your anxiety.",
                "Join a support group. It can help to know you are not alone. See if there is a support at a local hospital or mental health clinic for those suffering from phobias. If you cannot find a support group in person, there are many support groups available online for a wide range of phobias and fears. It can be cathartic to talk out your fears with others, and you also may learn some coping mechanisms from others.",
                "Talk to friends and family about your fears. Let your friends and family know you're suffering from a phobia. Ask them for support as you try to confront and overcome your fear. It's important to have loved ones on your side when you're working through a mental health issue.\n\n\nYou should also let your loved ones know what they can do to help. For example, you can ask a friend to help you practice making eye contact."

            "intro": "Melted chocolate chips are one useful way to get melted chocolate quickly. The greater surface area of chocolate chips makes it easier and faster to melt, improving your chances of getting the melted chocolate off the heat before condensation forms and risks seizing the chocolate. However, the smaller size of chocolate chips necessitates careful attention to avoid burning or drying out of the chips.",
            "steps": [
                "Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. You can use an actual double boiler, or improvise your own with a saucepan and a heat-safe bowl. Do not place the second saucepan or bowl on top just yet, however.\n\n\nIf you are using a bowl, make sure that it fits comfortably over the saucepan and that there are no gaps where heat can escape.\nDouble boilers are great if you need the chocolate to stay melted for a long time (ie: when you are making chocolate dipped strawberries).",
                "Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. While the water is coming to a boil, you can start measuring out the chocolate.\n\n\nIf you can't find any chocolate chips, you can use whole chocolate bars instead. You will need to cut them into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks first, however.[1]",
                "Take the saucepan off the burner. Set it down onto a heat-safe surface to protect your counter. It might be a good idea to keep it near the stove, however, just in case your chocolate starts to harden too quickly.",
                "Put the chocolate into your second saucepan.[2] If you are using a makeshift double boiler, then put the chocolate into your heat-safe bowl instead. Whichever one you end up using, make sure that it is perfectly dry. Any moisture will cause your chocolate to \"seize\" or harden.[3]\n\nIf you are working with large amounts of chocolate, consider putting only two-thirds of it in first. This will help it melt faster.[4]\n\nIt is possible to fix seized chocolate by adding cream to it, but this will affect your recipe.[5]",
                "Place the upper saucepan (or bowl) on top of your lower saucepan. Make sure that the bottom of your saucepan or bowl does not touch the surface of the water. If it does, pour some of the water out. Make sure that the fit is tight, and that no steam can escape.",
                "Wait for the chocolate to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula. Once again, make sure that the spatula is perfectly dry, or the chocolate will seize. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.\n\n\nIf you are working with large amounts of chocolate, you can add in the remaining third a little bit at a time.[6]",
                "Take the upper saucepan or bowl off the bottom one, and set it down on the counter. You can pour the water out of the bottom saucepan out at this time, although it might be a good idea to keep it filled until you are completely done baking—just in case your chocolate starts to harden too soon.",
                "Continue to stir the chocolate until the mixture is smooth and there are no chunks of chocolate left. Once the chocolate is melted, you can add in other ingredients to it, such as shortening or paraffin.[7]\n\nIf your recipe calls for paraffin as well, you must melt the paraffin separately first.[8]",
                "Use the chocolate in your recipe. If it is too hot, let it cool for about 10 minutes, give it a stir, then use it.[9]",
                "Put the chocolate chips into a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl.[10] It is important that the container you use remains cool or very slightly warm after several minutes of microwaving, otherwise, the container itself will overheat the chocolate. The container must also be perfectly dry, as any moisture will cause the chocolate to harden and become grainy.\n\n\nIf you can’t comfortably handle the container after several minutes of microwaving, then it isn’t a suitable container for melting chocolate.\nIf you can't find any chocolate chips, cut a chocolate bar into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks instead.\nIf you are planning on melting large amounts of chocolate, consider working in smaller batches instead.",
                "Microwave the chocolate on medium power for 1 minute, then give it a stir.[11] You can stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula or a spoon, but make sure that whatever you use is dry. Also, keep in mind that every microwave oven is different, so your chocolate may not be melted completely after this. That is perfectly fine; you can always continue heating the chocolate in short bursts.\n\n\nChocolate doesn't lose its shape when you microwave it, so stirring it will help make it smooth and more liquid-y.[12]",
                "Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted. Milk chocolate and white chocolate tend to overheat quicker than dark chocolate. It would be best to stir them every 10 seconds.[13] This may sound tedious, but it will reduce the chances of any scorching. Remember, chocolate will keep its shape when heated in the microwave, so stirring it up will help it \"melt.\"[14]\n\nHow long you end up cooking the chocolate also depends on how much you are working with. For example:\n\n1 ounce (30 grams) will take 1 minute total.\n8 ounces (225 grams) will take 3 minutes total.\n1 pound (450 grams) may take up to 6 minutes.",
                "Take the chocolate out of the microwave and continue stirring the chocolate until it turns smooth. Once the chocolate is mostly melted, take the bowl out of the microwave, and set it down onto a heat-safe surface. Continue stirring the chocolate, scrapping the bottom and sides of the bowl often, until it is smooth and no chunks remain.[15]",
                "Use your chocolate. At this point, you can also add in any other extra ingredients that the recipe calls for, such as shortening or paraffin."

        "wikiHow to Improve Daily Heart Function": {
            "intro": "The heart is one of the most hardworking, vital muscles in your body, pumping a little under 8 gallons of blood a minute.[1] Decreased heart function can lead to congestive heart failure, where your heart loses muscle strength and eventually stops. If your heart isn't functioning well, you may feel tired, your legs and lungs may fill with fluid, you may have trouble breathing, you may be dizzy and weak, and you may have an irregular heartbeat.[2] Fortunately, you can improve heart function by maintaining a heart-healthy diet, exercising, and making lifestyle changes.",
            "steps": [
                "Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Try to eat fish twice a week or look for daily a supplement containing 0.3 and 0.5 grams of EPA and DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids can protect your heart muscle by reducing inflammation in the body.[3] They may also reduce your triglyceride levels, blood pressure, blood clotting time, and irregular heartbeats. While you can purchase omega-3 fatty acid supplements in liquid gel cap form, there are many fish that are high in omega-3s. Opt for wild-caught fish and avoid farm-raised fish which are high in antibiotics, pesticides and other chemicals harmful to your health.[4] Fish high in omega-3s include:\n\n\nSalmon\nLake trout\nHerring\nSardines\nTuna",
                "Add nuts to your diet. Nuts contain omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, vitamin E, plant sterols, and arginine, an amino acid that can help relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. All of these can protect the heart and the FDA says that eating 1 ounce of some nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.[5][6] Fiber and plant sterols help lower your cholesterol, make you feel full on less, and may reduce your risk of diabetes, while vitamin E can prevent plaque buildup in the arteries. Try adding just a handful of walnuts or almonds to your meals. Eat either 1.5 ounces of nuts or 2 tablespoons of nut butter to get the health benefits.\n\n\nSince nuts are high in calories, eat small amounts of them and stop eating chips or soda to balance out the extra calories.",
                "Eat more berries. Try to eat 100 grams or around a cup of berries a day.[7] Berries, like strawberries and blueberries, are high in phytonutrients that help to protect the heart.[8] Studies show that eating berries every day can improve platelet function and \"good\" HDL cholesterol while reducing blood pressure. Each of these changes help to protect the heart from cardiovascular disease and improve heart function. Berries are also high in antioxidants known as polyphenols. Polyphenols are naturally found in plants and research suggests that they protect the body against cancers and cardiovascular diseases.[9]\n\nYou can also eat dark chocolate, tea, and red wine, which are also high in polyphenols.",
                "Consume colorful vegetables. Eat 1 to 2 cups of red, yellow and orange vegetables, which are high in carotenoids and flavonoids.[10] These protect against cardiovascular disease and improve heart function by preventing oxidation of cholesterol in the arteries.[11] Oxidized cholesterol increases the formation of plaque in the arteries which can lead to heart disease.[12] While you can take beta-carotene or astaxanthin supplements to get carotenoids, there are several vegetables that naturally contain high levels of carotenoids, such as:[13][14]\n\nPumpkins\nCarrots\nWinter squash\nPlantains\nCollard greens\nTomatoes\nRed peppers\nBroccoli\nBrussels sprouts\nKale\nSpinach\nOranges\nPeas",
                "Eat more avocado. Try to eat avocado every day, but limit yourself to 1/4 of an avocado, since they're high in calories. Try cubing them into salads, spreading them on sandwiches, or use them in place of butter. Avocados are known as one of nature's superfoods because they're high in monosaturated fats that lower your LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol, as well as polyunsaturated fats which, in moderation, are good for the heart. They also have anti-inflammatory properties.[15]\n\nInflammation increases the risk of atherosclerosis and hardening of the arteries. These can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.",
                "Consume foods high in resveratrol. Try drinking 1 to 2 cups of wine or grape juice or eat 2 cups of grapes or raisins.[16] Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that reduces the \"stickiness\" of blood platelets, which can prevent plaque buildup, reduce blood pressure, and improve heart function.[17] While you can take resveratrol supplements, it's also found in a variety of foods, including:\n\n\nRed and black grapes\nRed and black raisins\nRed wine (talk with your doctor about how much you can safely drink for health benefits)",
                "Avoid eating foods that contain trans-fatty acids. Trans fats will increase your “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and lower your “good” cholesterol (HDL). They're produced industrially to reduce the potential for spoilage and give food a longer shelf life. High cholesterol levels increase your risk of high blood pressure which increases the work of the heart. These will increase the risk of congestive heart failure and poor heart function.[18] Foods high in trans fats include:\n\n\nDeep fat fried food (like fried chicken, french fries, and doughnuts)\nBaked goods (especially those containing shortening, like pastries)\nFried snacks (like chips or popcorn popped in oil)\nRefrigerated dough (like canned cookie, biscuit, or pizza doughs)\nCreamers (like non-dairy coffee creamers)\nMargarine",
                "Recognize the benefits of regular exercise. Since your heart is a muscle, it needs exercise. Sedentary behavior, like sitting all day, is the top risk factor for heart disease.[19] Do a combination of stretching, aerobic exercise, and strength training to strengthen your heart and cardiovascular system. Exercise improves circulation and helps your body use oxygen more efficiently.[20]\n\nExercise can also improve your sleep and reduce stress, both of which are important for heart health.",
                "Warm up with dynamic stretches. Many people think they should begin their workout with static stretches, or stretches that lengthen your muscles while they stand in place, but this can actually cause injury and impede performance. Instead, you want to focus on dynamic, or active stretches, that put your muscles through their full range of motion and mimic the exercise you will be doing. For instance, if you are going to jog or run, warm up by walking and with dynamic stretches like high kicks, walking lunges, and butt kicks.\n\n\nProper stretching will lead to better physical fitness, increase mental and physical relaxation, and reduce muscle soreness.[21]",
                "Do aerobic (cardiovascular) exercise. Aerobic exercise is highly recommended for heart health because it breaks up stored fatty acids, providing more fuel for heart muscle.[22] It increases energy release and helps the heart function more efficiently by strengthening your heart and lungs. It will also lower blood pressure. You may want to exercise every other day to develop the exercise habit. Then, work up to exercising for 30 minutes five days a week (for a total of 150 minutes each week).[23] Any exercise that increases your heart rate and leaves you slightly out of breath is increasing the work of the heart muscle and improving function. Aerobic exercises that help improve your daily heart function include:[24]\n\nWalking\nJogging\nRowing\nSwimming\nTennis\nGolf\nCross country skiing\nSkating\nBiking\nJump roping\nLow-impact aerobic classes",
                "Strength (resistance) train. Strength train every other day to give your muscles a chance to rest between sessions. You can strength train by lifting weights, which will contract your muscles, help you gain strength, and improve your balance and coordination. Research is starting to suggest that strength training is an important part of heart health for these reasons.[25] The American Heart Association recommends strength training because it:[26]\n\nIncreases strength in bones, muscles and connective tissue.\nLowers the risk of injury.\nImproves muscle tone which burns more calories, making it easier to maintain a normal weight.\nImproves the quality of life.\nLowers blood pressure, reducing the amount of oxygen and blood needed to maintain cell health and lowering the overall risk of disease.",
                "Try stress-reducing techniques. You can try yoga, listen to calming music, meditate, exercise, or talk to friends to reduce daily stress. Stress can damage your heart function and increase the inflammatory response in your body.[27] It can also affect behaviors that impact your arteries and heart function. For example, many people turn to alcohol, smoking, overeating, and don't have much time for rest or exercise when stressed. This leads to high blood pressure, arterial wall damage and obesity that can all damage your heart function.[28]\n\nTry a variety of stress-reducing techniques until you find one that relaxes you. You might also try deep-breathing exercises, massage, hypnosis, or tai chi.[29]",
                "Quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about a smoking cessation program that will work with your lifestyle. Or, at least try to reduce smoking, since it contains thousands of chemicals that can seriously damage your heart. Smoking reduces heart function by increasing blood pressure, reducing exercise tolerance and increasing the likelihood that the blood will clot. Nicotine, the addictive compound in cigarettes, is known to increase heart rate and blood pressure.[30][31]\n\nYou should also take care to avoid secondhand smoke, which can also damage your heart.[32] Stay in open outdoor areas, upwind from friends and relatives who like to smoke.",
                "Laugh. Laughing can also reduce stress, which improves heart function. Researchers found that the old saying “laughter is the best medicine” holds some truth. They found that people with heart disease were 40 percent less likely to laugh compared to other people of the same age without heart disease.[33] Make it a point to find the things in life that give you joy and make you laugh every day. You might try:[34]\n\nWatching a funny movie or television show\nReading comedy books\nLaughing about the funny things your pet does\nSpending time around people that make you laugh",
                "Sleep seven to nine hours at night. Sleeping less than six hours a night or more than nine can increase your risk of heart disease and death. But, sleeping seven to nine hours each night leaves you feeling rested and refreshed. More importantly, it helps reduce your stress level and allows your body plenty of time to relax and unwind.[35]\n\nLack of sleep can increase your blood pressure, irritability, instability, and decrease your energy level.[36]",
                "Consider reducing your alcohol intake. Talk with your doctor about whether you should reduce or stop drinking alcohol. If there are no reasons why you shouldn't be able to drink, then one or two drinks should be safe. But, if you or someone in your family has a history of alcoholism, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, liver disease, heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension, then you should not drink alcohol. Each of these conditions will damage your heart function.[37]\n\nReview your alcohol intake with your doctor every year to discuss the benefits and risks.",
                "Check your blood pressure on a regular basis. You should have your blood pressure measured annually if it has been within normal limits, since blood pressure is an indicator of heart function. High blood pressure is one of the primary health conditions that damages the function of your heart.[38] If it's high, you'll need to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor. There are also several lifestyle changes you could make, including:[39]\n\nKeeping your weight within normal limits.\nDrinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water to avoid dehydration.\nCutting back on the amount of caffeine you drink daily.\nGetting involved in a supportive community."

        "wikiHow to Become a Health and Wellness Consultant": {
            "intro": "Across the globe, people are becoming more and more aware of how a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction techniques can increase their personal wellness. A health and wellness consultant is a professional who assists individuals in achieving and maintaining optimum wellness by advising them about healthy diets and exercise, as well as methods to cope with stress. Becoming a health and wellness consultant could offer a rewarding business opportunity.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn about the career. Before going down the career path towards becoming a wellness consultant, you should get a sense of what the career entails. A health and wellness consultant is a diverse career with a variety of specializations and focuses.\n\n\nIn short, a health and wellness consultant helps people live betters lives physically. As a health and wellness consultant, you would advise people on nutrition, physiology, anatomy, and fitness.[1]\n\nYou would work one-on-one with clients looking to improve certain aspects of their health and well-being. You would have to think of solutions for your clients depending on their lifestyle, physique, and individual wants. As a health and wellness consultant, you have to have a diversity of tactics and plans at your disposal to fit the needs of a number of different clients. For example, the fitness plan you would write up for a single mother of three would be vastly different than the one you'd write for a single 33 year-old businessman.[2]\n\nCommunication is an important skill to have if you're looking for a career as a wellness consultant. You need to understand your client's lifestyles, comfort zones, and personal wants and needs in order to best assess their situation and advise them on how to improve. You also need to communicate in a way that is encouraging and non-judgmental.[3]\n\nThere are a variety of specializations in health and wellness consulting. Some people focus on homeopathic, natural lifestyle changes. Others focus on fitness and exercise. Others focus mainly on nutrition. The specializations you choose later in your career will depend on your individual interests and expertise.",
                "Get started in high school. If you're interested in becoming a health and wellness consultant, your path should begin in high school. Develop a strong interest in fitness and health early on.\n\n\nEnroll in health classes in high school. In addition to the regular PE requirements, see if your high school offers any electives on nutrition or fitness.\nYou can get certain certifications, like a CPR certification, as early as high school. Look into what programs are available in your area. Many hospitals and community centers offer CPR classes.\nTalk to your teachers about wanting to be a health and wellness consultant, especially teachers from health or fitness related courses. They may be able to suggest college programs.\nTake summer and after school jobs that focus on fitness, nutrition, and overall well being. Work at a yoga studio or health food clinic. Lifeguard. Coach little league. Work at a summer camp.",
                "Choose the right undergraduate program for your goals. There is not a standard educational path to become a health and wellness consultant. The level of education you need will depend on your specific goals, but you should start tailoring your education towards health and wellness during your undergraduate years.\n\n\nSome schools offer career development or certification programs focusing on a specific aspect of health and wellness consulting. They may offer a path to become a fitness consultant, nutrition consultant, holistic health, and other areas that fall under the health and wellness umbrella. These programs may be shorter, and cheaper, but they also tend to limit your focus to one area. Unless you're certain of the path you want to go down early on, it's better to get a four year degree and keep your options open.[4]\n\nBiology, health sciences, kinesiology, and nutrition are majors you may want to consider if you want to be a health and wellness consultant. As the career itself is often multifaceted, it might be a good idea to double major. Also, health and wellness requires communication skills and focuses on client's emotional well being as well as their physical well-being. A minor in psychology or communications may help.[5]",
                "Consider furthering your education. Yet again, there is no set educational path to becoming a health and wellness consultant. You do not necessarily need more than an undergraduate degree, but furthering your education beyond a bachelor's degree could help you in the job market. This is particularly true if you want to work in a particular field of health and wellness consulting, such as placing your primary focus in fitness or holistic wellness.\n\n\nIf you're particularly interested in one aspect of health and wellness consulting, such as nutrition or fitness, a master's focused in that area can help. You may even consider a doctorate if you're particularly ambitious, but the pay off may not be worth it. While health and wellness consultants are generally high earners, earning around $70,000 a year, student loans can add up fast. Consider the potential debt before going for a PhD.[6]\n\nSome schools offer 2 to 3 year master's degrees focusing in health that can prepare you for a career in health and wellness consulting. University of Michigan, for example, offers a program in health informatics that teaches you how to work with and inform the general public about the importance of fitness, nutrition, and overall well being. This degree path, or a similar program, could provide you a good foundation for a career in health and wellness consulting.",
                "Consider licensure and certification. Unlike like becoming a real estate agent or accountant, there is no all encompassing license of exam for health and wellness consultants. The requirements for the career vary by state, field, and specialization.\n\n\nFigure out what city or state you would ideally like to be employed in and figure out what their specific qualifications are to becoming a health and wellness consultant. If you're unsure of where to find this information, find the contact information of a working health and wellness consultant in the area and ask. Some states may require additional training via a certification program, and a subsequent licensing exam, while other states may allow you to begin practicing as long as you have a relevant college degree.[7]\n\nCertification programs are available in most states, broken down by speciality. You can also find programs online, but many people prefer to learn hands-on skills. The certification program you choose should be catered to your interests. If, for example, you're interested in more holistic approaches to wellness and health find a certification program in holistic medicine and exercise.[8]\n\nDo your research before committing to any single program. See what kind of training is offered. A program with a lot of hands on work may reflect higher on you in the job market as opposed to an online program, for example. However, an online program may also be cheaper and shorter. Weigh the pros and cons of each program you research.[9]",
                "Gain the necessary skills. As you begin training and certification programs, begin to work on developing the proper skillet. You want to enter the job market with a diversity of skills specific to your field.\n\n\nCommunication skills are vital, so any part time jobs you take during training should involve working with people. Sales positions, customer service work, and volunteering to coach little league are all things that can help you bolster communication skills.[10]\n\nBusiness skills are also important. It might not be a bad idea to take a college course in business or auditing online during your training. You can also ask universities about the possibility of auditing a course.[11]\n\nA solid knowledge of nutrition and health is vital to becoming a health and wellness consultant. Make sure you stay up-to-date on the latest health and fitness trends and know how to research their validity. You might want to subscribe to a variety of health and fitness magazines to get a sense of what's currently going on in the field.[12]\n\nEmpathy is also important to the career path. This is something that's difficult to learn directly, but doing volunteer work that involves working one-on-one with those in need can help.",
                "Learn how to maintain any certification and licenses. Certifications and licenses generally come with a set expiration date. Make sure you understand when your license expires and what you can do to renew it. For most programs, you'll have to take additional coursework and seminars once a year to maintain your license.",
                "Seek jobs in the right places. A health and wellness consultant can work independently, but it might be difficult to set up your own practice right away. A variety of institutions hire consultants regularly. Try looking for work at some of the following places:\n\n\nFitness and Wellness Center\nMedical Center\nPrivate Practice\nYoga Studio\nDay spa\nNatural food store\nRestaurant\nCorporation\nSchool[13]\n\nIt's also a good idea to return to any institutions you previously worked, interned, or volunteered at and see if they're hiring. If not, they may be able to recommend you to an institution that is hiring and put in a good word for you. Networking is one of the main ways people find quality work.",
                "Work on your resume. In order to land a good job, you need to work on your resume. Start drafting your resume as you prepare for your job search.\n\n\nA resume should have a consistent format throughout. There are no hard and fast rules about punctuation and using bullet points versus small paragraphs for job descriptions, but know that any choices you make should be consistent.[14]\n\nYou should also use resume \"buzzwords.\" These are impressive words to make your work experience sound as impressive as possible. For example, instead of saying, \"Helped customers make good choices while shopping for organic food\" you could say something like, \"Enhanced customers' shopping experiences by educating them on a variety of organic products.\" Many websites include lists of buzzwords.[15]\n\nOnly list relevant experience to the job you're looking for. For a health and wellness consultant, stick to experience related to health, fitness, nutrition, and other aspects of health and well being. The fact you're a certified yoga instructor, for example, is more important than talking about waiting tables in college.[16]\n\nYou should always have a friend or family member proofread your resume for you. Many people become typo blind when reading their own work and might miss obvious spelling and grammatical errors.",
                "Practice good interview skills. Good interview skills are a must have when you're on the job hunt. Make sure you practice interview skills while sending out your resume so you'll be prepared when an interview offer arrives.\n\n\nShow up about 5 minutes before the interview time. Make sure you're dressed in professional attire. If you're unsure of the company wardrobe, it's better to overdress than to underdress.[17]\n\nAlways prepare for an interview. You should read up about the company online ahead of time and have a sense of its philosophy, ethics, and goals.[18]\n\nAt the end of the interview, ask questions. When the interviewer asks you if you have any questions, pick a question that's open ended rather than a logistical inquiry about when you can expect to hear back about the job. Something like, \"What is your company's philosophy?\" or \"What does an average day in your company looks like?\" are sure to impress your interviewer.[19]"

        "How to Stop Being Jealous": {
            "intro": "Occasional jealousy is natural and can even be motivating. But if you find yourself getting upset when seeing Instagram photos of clothes, jobs, or cars that you envy, you might need to work through this issue. Or maybe your jealousy is making you paranoid and causing problems with you and your significant other. Curbing these emotions can be difficult, but it’s often necessary to move forward and feel secure and confident. Work through your jealousy by addressing it, finding a new focus, and improving yourself. You got this!",
            "steps": [
                "Take a few deep breaths when you start feeling jealous. Perhaps you see your boyfriend talking to another girl or find out your friend got the exact truck you want. Instead of freaking out, calm yourself instead. Take a deep breath in through your nose for five seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Do this until you feel calm.[1]\n\nIf you want to address the issue, do so only when you’ve calmed down. For instance, if you see your boyfriend talking to a girl, calm down first, then approach him and say ‘hello’ to both of them. She may just be a friend or classmate.",
                "Stay off social media. Social media floods you with images of people sharing fragments of their lives that might spark your jealousy. But, what you may not know is the girl who constantly posts pics of the flowers her boyfriend gets her may be unhappy in her relationship. People tend to only post things that show them in a positive light, so stay off social media while you’re overcoming your jealousy.[2]\n\nIf you can’t stay off of social media, unfollow or unfriend the people you’re jealous of.",
                "Avoid criticizing or using sarcasm. When you’re feeling jealous, you might resort to name-calling or trying to diminish the accomplishments of others. However, this only shows your insecurity and makes others feel bad. Instead of being negative, keep your comments to yourself or compliment them.[3]\n\nFor instance, if your girlfriend comes home telling you about her new coworker, don’t say something like, “Oh, so since he’s so smart, you wanna go out with him now?” Allow your significant other to tell you things without fear of rudeness.",
                "Confess your feelings if the person is close to you. If you're very jealous of a sibling, best friend, or significant other, and have been for years, tell them. Getting it off your chest can help you move on from this negative feeling and clear the air.[4]\n\nFor instance, you might say, “Sis, I know that I’ve been a bit rude to you for a while. But when you got into Stanford and I didn’t, it hurt me. I’ve been so jealous of you because I feel like you’re living my dream. I know it’s not your fault, and I wish I didn’t feel this way.”",
                "Focus on what you have in common with the person you’re jealous of. Unravel your jealousy by looking at the similarities you and the person you envy share. The more you two are alike, the less you have to feel jealous over![5]\n\nFor example, maybe you’re jealous of your neighbor because they have a nice car. But remember that the two of you live in the same neighborhood and probably have similar houses. Maybe you went to the same school, too, and have friends in common.",
                "Praise those who are doing well. Hating on someone’s accomplishments won’t put you closer to your own goals. When you see others doing the things you want to do, give them kudos. This shows respect and humility.[6]\n\nFor instance, if your friend has an awesome career, say, “Molly, your job seems so cool. It seems like you’re always getting awards and promotions, too. You’re really killing it! Got any tips?”\nPerhaps your boyfriend has been doing a great job lately of being more affectionate; tell him you appreciate his effort.",
                "Reflect on your own strengths. Instead of harping on what others are doing, focus on yourself! Take a moment to either list or think about at least three things that you are good at. These can range from organizing or cooking to being a good listener or hard worker.[7]\n\nDo one thing related to your strengths list today to build your confidence, like cook an awesome meal.",
                "Compile a list of what you’re grateful for. Every day that you wake up is truly a blessing. Remember that and think about one thing that you’re thankful for each day. This will help reduce your feelings of jealousy because you’ll become more appreciative of what you do have.[8]\n\nMaybe you have an awesome mom who supports and loves you. Or perhaps you got into a really good school and you’re starting soon. Be thankful for these blessings!",
                "Meditate daily. Meditation can clear your mind and help you focus on what’s important. Your thoughts of jealousy might cloud your headspace daily, but get some relief by sitting quietly in an uninterrupted space in the mornings for at least ten minutes. During this time, focus only on your breathing and how your body feels.\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with meditation, you can also download an app like Simple Habit or Calm.",
                "Call the shots. You might have a rich friend who’s always asking you to go to expensive restaurants or on extravagant trips. This might make you feel jealous of their money. Instead of letting that control you, take the reins! Pick the restaurants you go to and choose not to go on vacations if you can’t afford it. Plan something locally, instead.[9]\n\nYou can say, “Hey Josh, I enjoy eating at five-star restaurants with you, but to be honest, it’s a little out of my price range. If you still wanna get dinner once a week, that’s cool, but you’ll have to let me pick the place most of the time. I hope you understand.”",
                "Have fun daily to distract you from your jealousy. You won’t be able to think about your jealousy as much if you’re out having fun! Schedule something to look forward to every day, like watching your favorite show, getting ice cream, or going shopping. Life is short, so make the most of it every day!",
                "Set short- and long-term goals. Use your jealousy to motivate you to become the best version of yourself. Based on the things you want in life, create action steps to help you achieve it. Set goals that you can achieve within the next five days and things to focus on for the next five years.[10]\n\nFor instance, maybe you want to get a high paying job. As a short-term goal, try to get A's in all your classes for the semester. A long-term goal could be finding a mentor or getting an internship in your field.",
                "Plan a fun getaway. Maybe you’re jealous because it seems like everyone else is having all the fun. Create some fun for you! Plan a fun weekend away for you and your bae, go to a theme park, or go hang out on the beach. Do whatever makes you happy![11]",
                "Take care of your health. You’ll be a lot less worried about others if you’re focused on your own health. Build your confidence up by exercising at least three times a week. Eat a healthy meal by having veggies, fruits and lean meat. Be sure to get at least eight hours of sleep per night.[12]\n\nDrink a lot of water, too!",
                "Surround yourself with positive people. Maybe your jealousy comes from hanging around friends who try to make you jealous on purpose. That’s definitely not cool. Instead of being around that negativity, spend more time with your kind-hearted, honest, and down-to-earth friends!\n\n\nA positive person will be supportive, honest, kind and helpful. A negative person will insult, criticize, and drain you.",
                "Consider seeing a counselor to work through your jealousy. If your jealousy is making it hard for you to enjoy life anymore, it might be time to seek outside help. There are many therapists who are trained to help their clients work through feelings of envy or inadequacy. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with getting help! It’s much worse to suffer in silence.[13]\n\nSearch online for therapists or counselors in your area. You can also get a referral from your doctor’s office or insurance provider."

        "wikiHow to Never Give Up": {
            "intro": "If you’re struggling to not give up, then it’s likely that you’ve had your fair share of challenges, adversity, and rejection. You may be tired of people telling you that “whatever kills you makes you stronger” and want to know how to stay positive and continue your drive to succeed. First, you should be proud of yourself for still trying. After that, you can work on developing a mindset and work ethic that will guarantee success if you continue to chase after your dreams.",
            "steps": [
                "Develop a more positive attitude. Though you may find it nearly impossible to be positive if you feel like you’ve tried everything and nothing is working for you, it’s important to stay as optimistic as you can if you want to never give up. Being positive makes you see all of the good things in your life that you may be missing out on because you’re focusing on the negative things. It will also make you more open to more opportunities and possibilities because you’ll be looking at life with a “can do” attitude.[1]\n\nIt’s true. Being more positive will not only make it easier for you to deal with challenges, but it will help you embrace new ones. If you’re bitter or focused on all of your failures, then you won’t be able to move forward.\nIf you catch yourself complaining or whining, try countering your negative comment with two positive ones.\nThough you shouldn’t feel like you’re faking it when you’re acting positive while feeling sad on the inside, you should know that the more you fake it, the more you’ll slowly begin to see the brighter side of life.\nOne way to be more optimistic is to surround yourself with happier people who make you appreciate life more. If all of your friends are negative and discouraging, then yeah, it’ll be hard to have a positive mindset and to feel like you shouldn’t give up.",
                "Learn to embrace change. If you want to work on developing the right mindset for not giving up, then you have to be able to roll with the punches and to not only accept change, but to thrive in it. Sure, you might have been thrown for a loop when your boyfriend broke up with you out of nowhere or when your family announced you were moving to a new city, but you have to learn to adapt to a new situation, to focus on whatever aspects of it exist, and to make a game plan for thriving in a new situation.[2]\n\nAs Sheryl Crow once said, sometimes “A change will do you good.” Even if you’re shocked or thrown off guard, tell yourself that this could be the very best thing for you.\nLook at change as an opportunity to learn something new, to meet new people, and to become a more well-rounded person. Though you may not see any positive aspects of the situation just yet, you should be proud of yourself for handling it with grace and for moving forward.",
                "Learn from your mistakes. If you want to be able to not give up, then you have to get into a mindset that allows you to come to terms with the mistakes you’ve made and to learn from them so you don’t keep having the same old problems. Though you may feel only discouraged or embarrassed when you first make a mistake, you should take a step back to understand what you did wrong and make a plan for not making the same mistake the next time.\n\n\nThough nobody wants to make a mistake, mistakes help you learn how to avoid future problems. For example, you may feel like you really messed up by dating a possessive boyfriend who ended up breaking your heart, but this mistake earlier in life may save you from picking the wrong husband in the future.\nDon’t be in denial about the fact that you could have acted differently. If you’re so focused on looking perfect all the time, then you won’t ever learn.",
                "Know that there will always be more opportunities for success. If you want to work on never giving up, then you have to have the mentality that there will always be more ways to succeed in the future. Though it’s important to live in the present, you should work on getting excited about the future instead of thinking that it has nothing to offer you; if you have the attitude that you’ve missed the boat somehow, then good opportunities will never come because you won’t be able to see them.\n\n\nYou may feel that, because you didn’t get the dream job you’ve been on three rounds of interviews for, that you’ll never find a career that suits you, but in the long run, you’ll see that you’ll be able to find plenty of jobs that also feel like that perfect fit, even if it takes a while to get there.\nYou can also work on opening up your definition of success. Sure, you might have thought that true success would be selling your novel when you were 25, but at 30, you may see that success can also be found in teaching literature to eager high school students.",
                "Seek knowledge. If you want to have a resilient mindset that helps you really succeed and not give up, then you have to continue gaining knowledge and learning more about life as well as the situation you’re in. If you have a thirst for knowledge and are excited about the world, then you’ll see that there’s always more for you to learn and more opportunities to seek. You can also gain knowledge in whatever it is you’re trying to do, whether it’s to apply to college, find a new job, or sell your novel; the more you know, the more capable you’ll be to handle any challenge that comes your way.\n\n\nOf course, reading as much as you can is the time-tested way to gain knowledge. This can mean reading novels, reading the news, or reading up on your chosen field on the Internet. However, you can also gain knowledge by talking to experts in your field, trying to network, or getting advice from people who know their stuff.\nAs long as you’re aware that there’s more for you to learn out there, you won’t be able to truly give up.",
                "Be more patient—good things will happen if you keep trying. Another reason that you may be thinking of giving up is because you want great things to happen to you right this second. You may think that just because you applied to 10 jobs, sent your novel manuscript to 5 agents, or have gone on dates with 4 different guys, that something should have worked out for you. However, the road to success is paved with plenty of failure, and you shouldn’t give up before you even really start trying.\n\n\nSometimes it can help to talk to other people who are going through the same process. For example, you may be feeling low because you applied to 20 jobs and haven’t heard a peep from any hiring managers; well, your friend who just got a new job may tell you that she applied to 70 jobs before even getting asked for an interview. It takes commitment and work to go after the life you want.\nSure, you may think that you’re smart, talented, and hardworking and that any college, employer, or potential soul mate would be lucky to have you. While this may be true, you can’t expect people to simply choose you because you and the people who know you know how awesome you are; it takes work and time to prove yourself.",
                "Don’t become a victim of learned helplessness. If you become a victim of learned helplessness, then you’ll believe that you won’t ever be able to succeed because the world is pitted against you. People who are victims of learned helplessness believe that they’ll never get anywhere because they haven’t had good results in the past. If you want to be able to deal with adversity, then you have to learn to embrace new opportunities instead of thinking that you’re destined to fail.[3]\n\nA person who has fallen victim to learned helplessness will believe something like, “Well, I haven’t gotten the last five jobs I interviewed for, so this must mean that I’ll just never be able to find a job. There must be something wrong with me, or finding jobs is all about networking anyway, so I might as well not even bother if I keep failing.”\nA person who wants to take control of her destiny will work on thinking positively and feeling like she has the power to change the situation. She’ll believe something like, “Even though the last five interviews haven’t worked out for me, I should be encouraged by the fact that hiring managers are interested in me at all. If I just keep sending out my resume and going on interviews, I know I’ll find a great job eventually.”",
                "Get a mentor you trust. Another way to deal with adversity is to find a mentor you trust who can help you deal with the more difficult challenges in life. Having a person who has been through what you’re going through or who has found a way to succeed in your field can help you feel more confident about continuing to go after what you want. Talking to another person can give you more advice and perspective on your situation, and can also help you feel encouraged.[4]\n\nPlus, it’s likely your mentor has dealt with his or her fair share of challenges and setbacks. Hearing about these will help you want to keep going, too.",
                "Maintain a strong social network. In addition to having a mentor you trust, having a strong social network can help you stay strong during a time of great need. Having friends to rely on, family members who love and care about you, and being part of a strong community of people who really care for each other can help you feel less alone and like you are capable of dealing with the challenges ahead of you. If you feel like you have to deal with this situation alone, then you are much more likely to feel hopeless and like you have to give up.\n\n\nHaving someone to talk to about your setbacks, even if that person can’t always give you the best advice, can help you feel less alone. Just having a person to talk to can make you feel like there’s hope for the future.\nTalking to other people who care for you about your struggles can also help you relieve stress; you’ll be much more likely to feel discouraged if you have to bottle up all of your feelings inside.",
                "Don’t forget to take care of yourself. If you’re going through a serious period of hardship, then the case may be that the last thing you want to do is to eat three meals a day, shower regularly, or get enough rest. However, if you want to keep going, then this is exactly what you have to do to stay mentally and physically strong. It will be much easier to want to give up if you feel tired, are eating poorly, or if you haven’t showered in a few days. [5]\n\nMaking an effort to eat three healthy, balanced meals that contain lean proteins, fruits or veggies, and healthy carbs can make you feel more energized and ready to tackle any challenges that come your way.\nTry to sleep for at least 7-8 hours a night and to go to bed and wake up around the same time. This will help you feel capable of dealing with whatever the world throws at you.",
                "Be a person of action. If you want to be able to not give up, then you can’t sit around complaining about all of your failures, moping in bed, or just making excuses for all of the reasons you failed. You have to be a person of action and to make a game plan for succeeding; this means putting yourself out there, applying for jobs, networking, going on dates, or doing whatever it is you have to do to reach your goals. If you’re sitting around bemoaning all of the failure you’ve faced and feeling sorry for yourself, then good things won’t happen to you.\n\n\nOf course, we all need to sit back, throw a personal pity party, and feel sorry for ourselves from time to time. However, you can’t let these feelings get you into a funk that keeps you from trying again.\nFirst, sit down and make a written plan for success. Having these items listed out will make you feel much more capable of getting what you want.",
                "Build your confidence. It’s true, your confidence may be shaken if you’ve spent so many years at the same low-paying job where you don’t feel valued, but you can’t let that keep you from feeling worthy of something better. You should make an effort to embrace all of the things you love about yourself, to address the flaws that you can change, and to feel happy about being the person who you are. Though building true confidence takes a long time, the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll be able to deal with challenges.\n\n\nWork on erasing self-doubt and feeling like you can achieve anything you put your mind to. If you’re the first person to doubt yourself, then anyone you meet will follow you.\nHang out with people who make you feel good about yourself instead of putting you down.\nFake it until you make it with positive body language. Stand tall, don’t slouch, and don’t cross your arms over your chest. Look happy and open to what the world may bring.",
                "Grow stronger from failure. You may have heard the optimistic expression, “Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” However, strictly speaking, this expression isn’t always true. In fact, if you experience a lot of failure and let yourself be truly discouraged by it, then you’ll actually be getting yourself beat down, instead of developing a thicker skin. You need to learn to embrace failure and to look at what you can learn from it, instead of letting it make you feel like you’re unworthy of success.\n\n\nEvery time you fail, don’t just let it make you feel worse, but sit down and think about what you’ve learned from it. Think about what you could have done differently to succeed the next time around.\nBe proud of yourself for failing. Many people never put themselves out there to begin with. Sure, it’s no fun to fail, but it’s the only way to get what you want.",
                "Don’t let your past dictate your future. You may think that, because you’ve failed so many times in the past, and have had no luck with selling your first novel, dating people, or losing weight, that you’ll never be able to amount to anything. However, many successful people come from humble beginnings, were raised in poverty, or had the door slammed in their faces again and again and again. Let your past empower you and drive you to succeed, instead of having it make you think you’re not worthy.\n\n\nSure, you may feel like all of your jobs so far have only lowered your self worth and made you feel inadequate. However, this doesn’t mean your future jobs have to be like that. In fact, they should inspire you to find something better for yourself.\nIf you think you’re only destined to repeat the past, then you’ll be sabotaging yourself. For example, if you’re in a great relationship but all you can think of is all of your failed relationships, then yeah, you’re going to mess this one up, too, because you don’t think you deserve any better.",
                "Set and meet reasonable goals. Another way to stay strong is to make sure that you’re setting reasonable goals that you can achieve. Of course, it’s great to aim for the moon so you fall among the stars if you fail, and so on, but the reality is, you should create small goals that build up to your ultimate goals, so that you feel proud of what you’re accomplishing along the way. Making your life feel more manageable will drive you to not give up.\n\n\nFor example, if your goal is to publish a novel, then yeah, you’re bound to be disappointed for all of the years that you can’t do it, because you’re going to make yourself feel like a failure.\nHowever, if you set smaller goals, like publishing a short story in a small journal, and then publishing a short story in a more established journal, and then writing a draft of a novel, and so on, then you’ll be much more capable of achieving these little goals along the way and will feel more confident moving forward.",
                "See if you need to find a new way to make your dreams come true. Okay, so nobody wants to hear it, but sometimes, you may want to sit back and think about whether or not you’re just torturing yourself by setting ridiculously hard goals for yourself. Sure, you may want to be a Broadway actress; while this is a dream come true, you may also find a way to do what you love and inspire others in other ways, such as being a Drama teacher, landing smaller acting gigs, or even starting a blog about your attempts to enter the arts.\n\n\nYou shouldn’t think of this as a way of lowering your expectations, but as a way to make it easier for you to enjoy your life.\nYou don’t want to spend your whole life feeling like a loser because you never rose to fame, do you? That kind of feeling will leave you feeling unsatisfied with all you have achieved.",
                "Manage your stress. Another way to stay strong in the face of failure is to learn how to cope with all of the stress you may be feeling from wanting to give up. Whether you simply can’t find a job that gives you the health benefits you so badly need, or you can’t deal with juggling a family and trying to write a screenplay, you need to find a way to manage your stress to make your path to success more possible. Here are some things you can do to manage your stress:\n\n\nSpend time with people who help you feel calm\nDitch as many stressful factors in your life as you can\nScale back on your work where you can\nDo yoga or meditate\nDrink less caffeine\nAvoid alcohol as a coping mechanism\nTalk to a friend, loved one, or therapist about your problems\nWrite in a journal",
                "Stop doing the same thing and expect different results. If you want to stay strong and to not give up, then another thing you can do is to find a new way to look at your situation. Okay, if you submitted 70 job applications and haven’t heard a peep, then your best bet may not be to submit another 70, but to have someone look at your cover letter or resume to make sure they are up to speed, to seek out more volunteer experience, or to spend more time on networking. If you keep doing the same old thing over and over again, then you’ll start to feel like you’re butting your head against the wall.\n\n\nFor example, if you’ve gone on 25 first dates and 0 second ones, then you should ask yourself what you can do differently to connect with more people. This does not mean that there’s something wrong with you, but that you need to shift your perspective.\nSometimes, you may find that all you need is a change. For example, if you’ve been begging your bosses to give you a raise or more responsibilities at work but you’re getting nothing back, then you may only be able to get what you want if you search for a new job.",
                "Don’t let anyone else lower your self-worth. It’s easy to feel like giving up if all of the people around you are making you feel like this is the best option. However, you can’t let other people tell you who you are, whether they are literary agents, hiring managers, or boyfriends. You have to work on letting your self-worth come from within and not letting people make you feel like less of a person.[6]\n\nOf course, if people are giving you constructive feedback, then you should listen to it instead of calling them haters. If people really want you to improve, then you should listen to them and see how you can do better the next time.\nKnow that it’s a cold world out there, and that most people spend the majority of their lives dealing with rejection. Don’t think you’re unique for being rejected so much and focus on changing your attitude toward this unfortunate aspect of life.",
                "Keep your life in perspective. If you want to have the drive and motivation to keep going, then you have to learn to step back and take a look at the big picture. Is your life really as completely terrible as you think it is? Sure, you may not have your dream job right now, but you’re lucky to find work in this economy. Okay, so it sucks to be single sometimes, but at least you have your health and so many friends who want the best for you. Remind yourself of all of the good in your life and use it to motivate you to achieve great things.[7]\n\nMake a gratitude list. Write down all of the things that make your life worth living and look at it frequently. This will make you see that things aren’t as bad as they seem.\nTake the time to thank your friends and loved ones for all they have done for you. This will help you see that your life isn’t all doom and gloom.",
                "Be a part of a community of people who want the same thing. Another way to not give up is to join a group of people who are going through a similar quest. If you’re dealing with alcoholism, then join AA. If you’re trying to get your novel published, join a writer’s group. If you’re trying to meet a significant other, go to singles mixers. You may feel like you’re the only person in the world dealing with your particular struggle, but if you make an effort, you’ll see that you are far from alone.\n\n\nA community of like-minded people can help you get great advice, encouragement, and a feeling of belonging."

But taking care of this hair can be difficult if you don't know the right tricks to keep it perfect. Not only will brushing and styling the dolls hair make them look fashionable. It may even prove fun to you during the process.",
            "steps": [
                "Lightly brush out the dolls hair. This will remove any tangles or knots from the hair before misting and styling them. When picking out a brush match it to the dolls hair. For example, if your doll has straight or wavy hair, use the normal brush. But if it has wavy hair use the pick, both sold in store and online at American Girl.",
                "Get a spray bottle and lightly mist the hair. This will calm the stray pieces and keep it down. Be sure to brush the hair after a few mists and not drench them. Bottles made for especially their hair are sold again at American Girl.",
                "Collect items such as hair ties and hair clips to keep for the doll. With these items you can style the dolls hair. These styles can range from simple ponytails to complicated pullback flipped braids. Again, these styles vary from what hair your doll comes with.",
                "Choose a good time to do the hair. When your doll is about to get her beauty sleep, do her hair.",

                "Keep the AG Doll's body away from water. Water can sink into the wool and mess up the cotton inside, making her less huggable.\n\n\nAlso keep water away from their eyes.",

        "wikiHow to Write an Apology Letter": {
            "intro": "True or False: You should always end your letter with a basic, formal closing. ",
            "steps": [
                "State what your letter is about. It’s a good idea to begin by letting them know that this letter is an apology. This will give them the chance to put themselves, emotionally, in the right place to read the rest of your letter. You don’t want them to be confused about why you’re writing or what you’re going to say.\n\n\nSay something like: “I wanted to write you a letter to apologize for what i did”.",
                "State your mistake and be nice about it. Now that you’ve acknowledged that you’re apologizing, say what you’re apologizing for and why it was incorrect. Be very exact and descriptive don't leave any thing out. By fully putting it out there in the open, the person that you’re apologizing to will know that you do really understand what you did.\n\n\nSay something like: “What I did last weekend was horribly inappropriate, disrespectful, and wildly selfish. Your wedding is supposed to be all about your happiness and celebrating your love. By proposing to Jessica, I turned that focus on to me. I tried to steal your moment and that was wrong.”",
                "Acknowledge how much you have hurt them. Acknowledge that they have been hurt and that you understand just how hurtful it was. This is usually a good time to also mention that you never intended for them to be hurt.\n\n\nSay something like: “Jacob told me that my actions ruined not only your experience of your wedding, but also are now making your honeymoon less than the incredible experience that it should be. I hope you understand that that was never my intention. I wanted you to be able to look back on this time and remember only happy things but I have ruined that with my selfish actions. I've robbed you of those happy memories. While I can't truly know how this feels to you, I can certainly understand that what I did was one of the worst things I could possibly have done to you.”",
                "Express your gratitude. If you want to, though it is not required, you can acknowledge all the hard work and good things that they've done for you in the past. This shows them that you appreciate them and can help show that you really do feel bad about what you've done.\n\n\nSay something like: “This is an especially terrible thing for me to have done to you after how warmly you have accepted me into your family. You have not only shown your incredible, beautiful love to my brother, but you have also shown me support and kindness that I never could have possibly expected. To hurt you in this way was an insult to all the things that you have done for me and I hate myself for that.”",
                "Accept responsibility. This is one of the most important parts of an apology but can be the hardest to say. Even if the other person did make some mistakes, acknowledgement of that does not belong in this letter. What you do need to do is admit your responsibility for your mistake openly and without reservation. You might have had good reasons for doing what you did but that shouldn't keep you from saying that your actions caused someone to get hurt.\n\n\nSay something like: “I would try to offer an explanation for what I did, but there are no excuses. My intentions, though good, don't matter here: only my poor choices. I absolutely take responsibility for my selfish actions and the terrible pain I have caused you.”\nDon't make excuses for your actions but you can explain your reasoning very carefully. If you really feel like it's needed or would make the situation better, you can explain why you made the choice that you made. This should be done only if you think understanding your choices would give the person you hurt some comfort.",
                "Offer a solution that will lead to change. Just saying that you're sorry isn't really enough. What really gives an apology some punch is finding a way to solve the problem in the future. This is better, even, than just saying that it will never happen again. When you offer a plan for change and how you're going to go about it, this shows the person that you're really serious about making the situation better.\n\n\nSay something like: “But just being sorry isn't enough. You deserve better. When you come home, Jessica and I would love to throw a big welcome-home party in your honor. This will be the party to end all parties and it will be 100% devoted to celebrating the incredible love you share with my brother. If you would rather not do this, that's fine: I just want to find some way to help you create the incredible, happy memories that I took away from you. ”",
                "State a desire to have better interactions in the future. You shouldn't just outright ask for forgiveness. This places demands, whether you intend it or not, on a person whom you have already wronged. It is better to express what you really want, which is for the two of you to interact in a better way in the future.\n\n\nSay something like: “I can’t expect your forgiveness, though I certainly hope for it. All I can say is that I truly want things to be okay between us. I want you to feel okay and eventually even happy when you're around me. I want to earn back the wonderful relationship that we had. Hopefully, in the future, we can find a way to move past this and create happier times together.”",
                "Don't promise change unless you are 100% sure you can deliver. This is very important. If you made a mistake that you feel you are likely to repeat or that stems from inherent differences in personality or values, you do not want to promise them that you will change. This is because you will likely make the mistake again and future apologies, for anything really, will ring hollow.",
                "Watch what language you use. Apologizing is a skill. We naturally don't want to do it and will fight against it a lot of the time. This is why, if you want to apologize correctly, you'll want to be careful about your language. Some phrases and words sound like an apology but actually make the situation worse because they show that you really aren't sorry. It's easy to use these words by accident, so be conscious as you're writing your letter. Examples include:\n\n\n\"Mistakes were made...\"\n\"If\" statements like \"I'm sorry if your feelings got hurt\" or \"If you felt bad about this...\"\n\"I'm sorry that you felt that way.\"",
                "Be sincere and genuine. When you apologize, you need to be sincere and genuine about it. If you can't be, in some cases it might be better to wait until you really are sorry before apologizing. When you write your letter, skip the form language and cliches. Don't just copy some letter that you find on the internet. You want what you say to be specific to your situation so that the person you're apologizing to knows that you really understand what happened and why it was bad.",
                "Keep expectations and assumptions out of your letter. You don't want your letter to sound demanding, rude, or create further insult. You don't want to try to or appear to try to guilt someone into forgiveness. You don't want to make assumptions about how they feel or why they're upset, because you might end up showing how little you understand about what happened. With all of the language you use, it's better to take a tone that is humble and leaves them feeling in control of the situation. This sort of language is most likely to help them forgive you.",
                "Wait a day or two before mailing it. If possible, wait a few days before sending your letter. You want to be able to read it when you're a little more emotionally removed from what you wrote.",
                "Choose the best way to start the letter. With an apology, you'll want to start your letter with the usual \"Dear,.....\" It is better not to get flowery with your language at the start of the letter and to keep the salutation as basic as possible.",
                "End your letter gracefully. If you don't know how else to end your letter, default to the basic \"Sincerely...\" However, you can also get a little more creative if you want to keep the letter sounding less like a basic letter. Try phrases like \"I sincerely thank you for hearing me out\" or \"Again, I deeply apologize for the problems my actions caused, and I hope I can work to make it right.\"",
                "Account for a formal apology. If you're writing an apology letter in a professional or formal setting, then you're going to need to be sure that the letter looks formal. Aside from having it nicely printed, you should also add things like the date, your name, the name of your organization, your written signature, and other formatting associated with a formal letter as needed.\n\n\nYou'll also need to adjust the syntax of your letter to sound formal and better fit the situation."

        "wikiHow to Calm Irritated Skin": {
            "intro": "Skin irritation affects almost everyone at some point in their life, whether it is a daily condition, like eczema, or a temporary pain, like bug bites and sunburn. Redness, swelling and bumpiness are some effects of skin inflammation. There are several things you can do to calm irritated skin immediately and to keep it from happening again.",
            "steps": [
                "Cover the area with steeped green tea bags. Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties to reduce redness and puffiness. Steep 4-6 bags in boiling water for 5 minutes, press out excess water, and place on your skin for up to 10 minutes.[1]\n\nBe careful when handling steeped tea bags, as they will be hot. Let them cool for a minute before pressing or applying.\nFor larger areas of irritation, soak a washcloth in the tea and use this on your skin, instead.\nYou can also use chamomile tea instead. Try steeping a bag in one cup of hot water until cool, then use a cotton ball to apply the tea as a toner.[2]",
                "Try an oatmeal mask. Oatmeal has anti-inflammatory properties and anti-oxidant compounds. It soothes redness and any itching. Mix 2 Tbsp oatmeal, grinded into a powder, with 2 Tbsp hot water and ½ Tbsp honey. Let sit for 5 minutes, then massage into skin. Leave on for 10 minutes, and rinse with warm water.[3]\n\nGrind oatmeal in a coffee grinder or food processor for best results.\nOatmeal also helps moisturize and reduces the size of pores.",
                "Apply a cold milk compress. Milk has anti-inflammatory molecules that will calm red, irritated skin. Soak a washcloth in cold milk and place on skin for 10 minutes.[4]\n\nIf you don’t have milk on hand, a cold compress with water or ice will reduce the temperature of your skin and lessen redness.[5]\n\nYogurt can also be applied as a face mask for 10 minutes. Make sure to use regular yogurt, with no added sugar or flavors.[6]",
                "Try hydrocortisone cream. This over-the-counter medication may relieve itching. It is, however, a topical steroid, so you should not use it on your face, or on skin folds such as your groin, axilla, or pendulous breasts. To use it, apply it in a thin film over the affected area up to 4 times a day for 5-7 days.",
                "Take an over-the-counter antihistamine. To help control itching, you can try taking an oral OTC antihistamine, like Benadryl, Claritin, or Zyrtec. Consult your pharmacist if you have any questions about how much you should take.\n\n\nDon't take a topical antihistamine, such as Caladryl. This may worsen your skin reaction.",
                "Take an oatmeal bath. Buy an oatmeal bath, like the one sold by Aveeno. Put the oatmeal treatment into your bathtub to help soothe your skin and relieve itching. However, this is only a temporary soothing solution.[7]\n\nYou can also add 2 cups of oatmeal to warm bath water and soak to calm large areas of red, irritated skin. When the water cools, rinse off the oatmeal and gently pat your skin dry.[8]\n\nThis is especially good for chicken pox, poison ivy, and eczema.",
                "Apply calamine lotion. After you soak your skin, you can use calamine lotion to prevent itching and soothe your skin. Make sure that calamine lotion does not interact with any other medication you're taking.[9]",
                "Use a hospital strength itch reliever. Over-the-counter itch relievers, such as Dermoplast, are designed to spray in hard-to-reach places and relieve itch. Many products like this also have moisturizer in them.[10]",
                "Use a clay mask. Bentonite, or green clay, helps relieve itching from bug bites or stings by removing toxins from skin. It is also great for treating acne.[11] Mix clay with enough filtered water to make a paste and apply directly to skin. Let it dry and wash or peel it off.[12]\n\nYou can also apply a layer of paste to a cloth or clean cotton bandage, lay over skin and secure, and wear for 4 hours.\nLook for clay that is untreated.",
                "Rub apple cider vinegar onto your skin. Dip a cotton ball into the vinegar and dab onto the itchy area. Apple cider vinegar is an anti-septic and has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties.[13]\n\nRaw, unfiltered vinegar is the best and most gentle type. Buy organic if possible.\nApple cider vinegar can help pets with itchy skin too. Just add a couple cups to their bath water.",
                "Grow herbs that fight itching, like peppermint, basil and plantain. These leaves can be crushed and applied directly to skin to reduce itching. All are great remedies for bug bites.[14]\n\nPeppermint also has a cooling sensation that soothes skin. Freeze crushed peppermint in ice cube trays for double cooling.\nChew plantain leaves and apply to directly to bites, stings, or poison ivy. Steep leaves in hot water to make a spray for relieving pain and itching from sunburn. Just make sure to let it cool first.[15]\n\nRubbing leaves onto your skin also helps satisfies the urge to scratch, and is much better for your skin.",
                "Apply aloe vera gel to burned skin. You can easily grow your own aloe vera plants and use them instead of buying gels from the store that may have added ingredients. Just break a leaf and squeeze out the gel.\n\n\nYou can get more gel from the leaf by filleting the leaf and scooping out gel with a spoon.[16]",
                "Stop using harsh skin care products. Often, redness and irritation is the result of over-exfoliating or using abrasive or harsh acne reducing products. Stop using anything new you have put on your skin for at least 4 days, and consider switching to a gentler cleaning product.[17]\n\nAcne medicines using retinoids are particularly irritating.\nAfter 4 days, try using the product sparingly to see if irritation still occurs. If so, throw it away.\nDo not introduce more than one product at a time to your skin, so you know which one is “too much.”",
                "Wash daily with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water. A good cleanser should wash off all dirt and makeup, but not your skin’s natural oils. If your skin feels tight or squeaky after washing, the product is too harsh.[18] Cetaphil and Eucerin are good products for sensitive skin.\n\n\nHot or cold water can damage capillaries and cause redness. Hot water also dries your skin out quickly, causing redness.[19]\n\nLook for a cleanser made for your skin type, whether it tends to be oily or dry. Foaming cleansers are generally bad for dry skin.[20]\n\nAvoid cleansers with harsh ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, menthol or alcohol.[21]\n\nAvoid products with fragrances and dyes. Also avoid medicated acne cleansers, since they usually strip away good oils.[22]\n\nYou may need to use different products for different seasons, depending on how dry the air is and how you skin conditions adjust accordingly.",
                "Moisturize your skin at least once a day. Choose a moisturizer with glycerin as the first ingredient since it is very efficient at holding in moisture,[23] or just use plain petroleum jelly.[24] Use it every time you shower, after drying off.\n\n\nBeware of typical hand sanitizers, which contain alcohol and dry out your skin. Look for one specifically made for hydrating dry skin too.[25]",
                "Switch to a laundry detergent without fragrances or harsh chemicals. If you are experiencing widespread irritation, it may be how you wash your clothes. Try a different detergent made for sensitive skin or that has mostly natural ingredients.[26]",
                "Buy a humidifier for your bedroom. If the air is dry, particularly in winter months, using a humidifier can help prevent your skin from drying out while you sleep.[27] Moisture in the air also helps to reduce inflammation.",
                "Eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Fill your plate with anti-inflammatory foods, such as leafy greens, salmon, avocado, and walnuts. Take anti-inflammatory supplements, such as probiotics, spirulina, vitamin C, and fish oil. These nutrients will help you reduce inflammation in your skin."

        "wikiHow to Take a Dog's Temperature Without Using a Thermometer": {
            "intro": "When might a dog's fever be a sign of a more serious bacterial infection?",
            "steps": [
                "Feel your dog’s ears and paws. A dog with fever usually has very hot ears and paws. You can gauge his temperature by using sensitive body parts like your cheeks and the back of your hands over his ears and paws. Are his warmer than yours? Healthy dogs only run slightly higher in temperature than humans.\n\n\nA dog's ears and paws have a lot of blood vessels. When he has a fever, these areas get hot because of the migration of immune cells from the blood into the areas of the body where an infection is taking place. The increase in the circulating immune cells in the blood can manifest as heat in the blood vessels.\nIt is unusual for the left and right ear to be different temperatures. If one ear is warmer than the other, this is usually a sign of a localized ear infection, rather than a generalized fever.",
                "Feel your dog's nose. If your dog has a hot nose lined with greenish or yellowish nasal discharge, it's likely he has a fever and an infection.[1] This could mean that your dog is fighting off a respiratory infection, though this may be evident only in more serious cases. Certain diseases like distemper and kennel cough have these clinical signs, too. Therefore it is incredibly important that you quickly bring your dog to the vet if you see greenish or yellowish nasal discharges.\n\n\nA normal dog can have a fluctuating temperature and level of wetness – it's a myth that dog noses are always cold and wet. In fact, the nose often becomes dry from common situations, such as lying in the sun, sleeping near the radiator, exercising, or when the dog is dehydrated. What does your dog's nose normally feel like? Has he done any of these things recently to account for a dry, hot nose?",
                "Feel your dog’s armpits and groin area. These areas are usually swollen and hot when your dog has an infection and fever. You can use the back of your hands to feel for heat in the lymph nodes in the armpits and groin area. However, make sure your own hands are at room temperature, not chilled or hot, as they provide your reference point.\n\n\nLymph nodes contain immune cells that fight bacteria and viruses. They filter the blood against these infectious organisms, and when there is an infection, the lymph nodes serve as a defense area. This area then becomes filled with immune cells that secrete different substances that trigger the brain to cause fever. These areas become swollen and hot because they become inflamed as a result of the different immune reactions going on simultaneously.\nBecause the armpit and groin areas of the dog have a lot of exposed skin with very little fur, feeling for heat in these areas can be done easily.",
                "Examine his gums. Your dog's gums may feel warm and dry if he has a fever. Another important sign to watch for here is his gums appearing redder than usual, especially a bright brick red. This can be a sign of high fever, or even septicemia.\n\n\nIn a dog without dental disease, the gums should be moist, shiny, and a similar pink color to our own gums. Lift up the dog’s lip behind the upper canine tooth, and place the tip of your forefinger against the gum to assess temperature and moistness. Is the color, heat, and moistness similar to yours? If not, infection may be present.",
                "Check for signs of low temperature. An unwell dog, or one in shock, may have a low body temperature. In addition to having cold extremities, the dog may show physiological temperature adaptations such as shaking or getting goosebumps. A dog with a dangerously low temperature will also be very subdued, and possibly collapsed. In this case, seek out your vet immediately.\n\n\nBe aware that not all shaking dogs are cold; this can also be a response to stress, anxiety or pain. If you know of no reason for your dog to be acting like this, contact your vet as soon as possible.",
                "Look for the other signs of fever. Apart from physical temperature, one of the first things you can do is to observe your dog for other physical signs of fever. It's important to be alert for changes in normal behavior from having difficulty defecating, to coughing or sneezing, since this may provide vital information as to the seat of infection.[2] Possible symptoms include:[3]\n\nPoor appetite\nLethargy, sluggishness or inactivity\nWeakness\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nSleeping all day\nWithdrawing away from other dogs",
                "Observe your dog's appearance and behavior. When a dog runs a significant fever, from a few feet away and without touching him, you can feel heat radiating from his body. There will be a handful of other visible symptoms you can look for, too:\n\n\nHe is likely to be panting heavily for prolonged periods of time, and his breath will feel hot against your cheek.\nHe may be thirsty and drink more water than usual, because he loses fluid as he pants.\nA fever can make joints feel achy and sore. In the dog this manifests itself as a reluctance to exercise, stiffness on rising and a stilted gait or even lameness.\nA dog with a fever will be withdrawn, quiet and lethargic. He may become uncharacteristically aggressive when touched, because he feels uncomfortable and irritable.\nHe is less likely to groom and his coat will appear unkempt and \"starry,\" or dull and dry.",
                "Stroke, pet, and engage your dog in play. Try to remember the feel of your dog’s body when he is not sick. Are his eyes dull? His coat less silky? Is he less rambunctious and eager than usual? Changes in these physical and behavioral characteristics may be a sign of illness.",
                "If he seems well, assess him again in an hour. If the dog is behaving naturally, is hot but seems otherwise well, let him rest in a cool place for an hour and then re-check his temperature again to see if the signs you did detect have normalized. Since a fever is a normal immune response, it may just be something you have to wait out if it's not serious.\n\n\nRemember, if the temperature of the dog’s extremities is raised and he is behaving abnormally, this is more likely to be significant than for a warm dog that appears otherwise well. It's infection you need to be worried about, not fever.",
                "Know that fever is a normal immune response. In most situations, fever is nothing to worry about. It's a good indicator that the body is fighting back an infection or is undergoing repairs. In some situations, however, fever can be the sign of a bacterial infection. If your dog is displaying any abnormal symptoms, contact your vet immediately.\n\n\nWhen bacterial infections with gram negative bacteria are present, they release toxins from their cell walls that act as signals to the brain to cause fever. In these cases severe bacterial infection can lead to even more severe fever with a very high temperature.[4] This extreme temperature, instead of helping the animal can lead to damages to sensitive organs, like the testicles and the brain. When this happens, convulsions and coma, and sometimes sterility, can result. Thus it is very important that a fever be detected earlier, and a prompt veterinary therapy be given to prevent these unwanted effects.",
                "Call the vet. When in doubt, contact your vet for a professional opinion. In addition to seeking medical treatment if abnormal symptoms are present, it's a good idea to take this fever seriously if it lasts for more than 24 hours, too. Your vet can prescribe an anti-pyretic (anti-fever) medication to bring his temperature down almost immediately.",
                "Consider other related physical ailments. If your dog's fever is related to another, often more serious, condition, you'll notice another set of symptoms entirely. It could be a more serious respiratory or gastro-intestinal infection. Be on the lookout for the following:\n\n\nIf he has a respiratory infection he may cough, sneeze, and have a runny nose or streaming eyes. This will likely impede his normally rambunctious behavior and sleep patterns, too.\nIf he has gastro-intestinal infection or inflammation, then he may be anorexic, vomit or have diarrhea. If you suspect he has a gastro-intestinal disturbance, follow him outside when he toilets so that you can see what he passes. Does he have diarrhea? Is there blood in his urine?\nIf you notice anything abnormal related to either condition, consult your vet immediately. There is likely an infection present; fever is just one of many symptoms present that need to be addressed."

        "How to Get Into Stanford": {
            "intro": "Choosing a college can be a very stressful time, especially when you're aiming for one of the absolute best schools in the US. Stanford is a \"holistic\" school with no minimum GPA, class rank, or standardized test score requirements. While they accepted a grand total of 5% of all applicants last year, it's still possible.[1] We'll outline the process of becoming a Cardinal. Read on.",
            "steps": [
                "Start ASAP. The fact of the matter is that kids are growing up faster and faster nowadays and parents are becoming more and more demanding. Taking an AP class in high school isn't nearly as impressive when your neighbor is taking it as a 12-year-old. The sooner you start being an amazing student, the better! In other words, start in junior high if you can.\n\n\nYou know the phrase \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks?\" Take it to heart. Picking up a sport, a language, a hobby, or a skill is infinitely harder the older you get. Do yourself a favor now and get involved in whatever you can. By the time you need to apply, you'll be the cream of the crop.",
                "Get on the right academic track in high school. Meet with your high school counselor regularly from day one to review your academic progress. Inform them you're looking to go to Stanford so they can get you on the right track as soon as possible. They'll be able to suggest classes and tell you what you need to do to get started.\n\n\nKeep your career goals in mind when it comes to choosing classes. For example, becoming a doctor would require Algebra 1, 2, Geometry, Calculus, Trigonometry, and any other math classes you have offered in your school along with Physics, Chemistry, and any other science classes you have. For art/design careers, physics, geometry, art, and computer design are wonderful.\nBe aware that Stanford recommends 4 years of English with an emphasis on writing and literature; 4 years of Mathematics with emphasis on algebra, trigonometry and geometry; 3 years of History/Social Studies, preferably with an essay component; and 3 years of laboratory science, such as biology, chemistry and physics. Three-to-four years of a foreign language is also recommended.",
                "Get outrageously stellar grades. The better your grades, the better your chances, even though Stanford has no \"minimum GPA\" requirement. And if your grades are in AP and advanced classes, even better. 56% of all applicants have a GPA of 4.0 or better.[1]\n\nThat being said, you can get into this school on less than perfect GPA. If you have a 3.5 but you invented a school curriculum that 10 states have adopted, you'll still get in. You just may end up going to MIT instead![2]",
                "Enroll yourself in AP classes. You should begin as early as possible taking gifted classes and any honors classes that your school offers. Yes, you will have to take EOC tests for those classes, but the more the merrier! If your school only offers a few, take them.\n\n\nThis is important because Stanford weighs certain classes against others. The more AP classes you have -- and if you get good grades in them -- the more impressive your application will be. Harder classes are given more consideration.[3]",
                "Think quality versus quantity when it comes to extracurricular activities. The university is looking for enthusiasm and commitment in what you're doing. That might be better shown as in-depth experience in a couple of activities rather than minimal participation in many clubs and sports. Find what you enjoy and do it. Do it throughout your high school career.\n\n\nNo extracurricular activity has more merit than another at this college. As long as you can prove you're sticking with it and advancing, it's impressive.\nParticipate in clubs that your school has, like Student Council, Spirit, Debate, or NHS. Run for class president and be one of the officers. Participate in a school play. Start an environment group. Be as well-rounded as possible.",
                "Volunteer. If there's something during your time in high school you should make time for, it's volunteering. Not only do you have to be smart, athletic, and well-spoken, you have to be kind and community-oriented, too. A good GPA isn't that hard to come by -- but a person with good character, solid morals, and a good GPA takes the cake.\n\n\nLook into volunteering at your local hospital, animal shelter, homeless shelter, nursing home, daycare, or with larger groups like Habitat for Humanity. If you're interested in an organization doesn't have an established volunteer program, ask! Very few people turn down those willing to work for free.",
                "Rock the ACT plus Writing or SAT test. One of these standardized tests is REQUIRED by Stanford in order to be considered. However, there's no minimal test score needed in order to be admitted. Although, getting a near perfect score will rocket your chances into getting into Stanford. In the last year, 25% of the admitted class received an 800 on their SAT for both math and critical thinking.[1]\n\nTwo SAT subject tests are recommended, but are not required. You will need to include official results if you choose to submit these tests. Take reading and math, as this is pretty much the bare minimum of the two tests. Take writing if possible. Go on websites like number2.com in middle school so you will get a perfect score in high school!\nIf your results are less than you were hoping for, don't let it keep you from applying. There are a dozen other things being considered in addition to your test scores.",
                "Do something extraordinary. If it's not easily explicable, even better. Consider student A: She's captain of the volleyball team, the lead in the school play, has a 4.0 GPA, volunteers at a domestic abuse shelter for women, is a black belt in karate, and speaks fluent Japanese and Tagalog. Impressive stuff. Student B just went on a UN trip to Switzerland and coordinated delegates. Wait, what?\n\n\nBoth students A and B did things that were very impressive and required hard work -- no one's going to argue otherwise. However, student A did things that most people could see themselves or someone they know doing. As for student B -- how they heck did they get involved with the UN at 17?! They must have something special about them. Even though student B got lucky, attended a conference and just schmoozed the right people, no one knows that. They just know that student B did something incredible. Something they can't explain. And that's impressive. Stanford loves impressive.[2]",
                "Know the deadlines. The Restrictive Early Action deadline is November 1st. The regular decision deadline is January 1st. If you are including an arts supplement, the deadlines are October 15th and December 1st, respectively. Most students abide by the regular decision guidelines.\n\n\n\"Restrictive Early Action\" should only be used if you are confident Stanford is your first choice. Conduct a thorough search of other colleges before you assume this is the action you should take.[4]\n\nVisit admission.stanford.edu/arts for information on submitting the arts supplement.[4] If you are serious about the arts and intend on pursuing them in some form (no commitment to pursuing them at Stanford is necessary), consider this section of the application and its respective deadlines.",
                "Go to Stanford's application website. For the most up-to-date information, that's where you'll want to be. Click on the \"never registered\" link under \"Apply\" in the middle of the screen. And you're off!\n\n\nYou must apply online unless you have special circumstances that prevent you from doing so. Stanford University only accepts online applications unless you are given special permission to send in paper applications.",
                "Fill out the \"First Year Common Application\" and \"The Stanford Supplement\" forms and submit both of them. The process will be very linear and straightforward online -- you can find them at commonapp.org.[4]\n\nYour high school transcripts are also required. Your school has the choice of sending them electronically or by mail. There are three forms that must be completed: the Secondary School Report, the Mid-Year School Report and the Final Report. These forms can be completed or downloaded at the Common Application Web Site.\nYou must also send in a $90 non-refundable application fee with these forms. If you'd like to have the fee waived, talk to your counselor and fill out the necessary form online or fax it to (650) 723-6050.[4]",
                "Obtain 2 teacher evaluations. These evaluations must come from teachers who taught you in grades 11 or 12, unless you took advanced level courses in grade 10. Be sure to ask well in advance -- some teachers will take their sweet, sweet time when it comes to recommendation letters and evaluations. Your teachers should submit them online, as per Stanford's preferences.\n\n\nThese evaluations must come from 2 different core subjects. Examples of accepted subjects include Math, English, Science, Foreign Languages or History/Social Sciences.\nYou may take the option of including a third letter not from a teacher, if you feel it would round out the impression you give of yourself. However, this is optional and a third letter will neither increase or decrease your chances.[4]",
                "Dominate the essay. Be yourself when writing your essays for Stanford. The college is looking for your \"genuine\" voice and not what you think they want, also known as \"packaging.\" The committee has seen it all, can easily call BS, and won't be impressed by anything other than innovation, genuineness, and honesty.\n\n\nIt is possible to write an essay on your love of ice cream and get in.[5] Don't think you have to write your standard \"Look at how awesome I am\" essay -- at least directly. If you show you have drive, commitment, and are willing to step out of the box, you stand a decent chance of getting in.",
                "Don't resort to using gimmicks. Rest assured that the acceptance committee doesn't fall for much. They've seen tie-dyed boxers, dozens and dozens of baked goods, and even planes flying overhead trying to get students in.[6] Know that they don't work. Only \"you\" seals the deal, not the gimmicks you employ.",
                "Be realistic. Each year, Stanford accepts fewer and fewer students -- well, really, more and more are applying (around 20,000).[7] Last year, they accepted around 7% of all applicants.[8] Even if you're Mr or Ms. Diamond Child Extraordinaire, you may not get in. And that's fine! It's not reflective of worth. Plenty of other schools will get you on the path to success, too.\n\n\nYou should always, always have safety schools up your sleeve. If Stanford doesn't work out, you need a backup plan. If they accept you it doesn't mean you have to go!",
                "Know that Stanford is need-blind. This means that whether you're the son of Bill Gates or the daughter of an unemployed illegal immigrant, you'll be given consideration. What's more, Stanford has great financial aid -- if you don't think you can afford it, apply anyway.\n\n\nYep, Stanford is a very, very expensive school to attend. You're looking at over $13,000 a quarter.[9] But again, don't write it off. Stanford knows it's expensive -- it wants to help you out. It doesn't care whether you're the best of the best -- if you need aid, you will receive it.\nApply for the CSS PROFILE (College Scholarship Service) and FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) online. It'll take about 20 minutes and should be done by January.[10]",
                "Meet the deadlines. For transfer students, the deadlines are a bit different. The application with the Arts supplement deadline and the standard application is March 15th; however, the SAT must be taken by January and the ACT by February. This goes for transferring students, whether you're international or not.\n\n\nTraditional students abide by an earlier timeline -- they apply by January. They'll also get notified by April, whereas you'll get notified by May.[11]",
                "Check that you meet Stanford's eligibility requirements for a transfer admission. Consult the Stanford Bulletin and the registrar's web page for the most updated information on what transfer credits are accepted. If you have any questions, your adviser can help you out.\n\n\nOnly classes in which you obtained a C- or higher will be counted toward your degree. What's more, only coursework from accredited universities that is similar to what Stanford offers will be accepted for credit.[12]\n\nIn order to obtain a degree from Stanford, you need to complete at least two years of coursework at the university. [12]",
                "Complete the Common Application's Transfer Application and the Stanford Supplement. Both of these must be completed and submitted online at the Common Application Web Site. Also complete the Transfer Application Personal Essay as well as the Stanford Supplement Short Essays. Essay tips can be found in the \"Mastering the Application Process\" of this article.\n\n\nThe process for you is very similar to process traditional students undertake. Instead of just high school transcripts, you'll be offering up your college ones, too. The same fees apply.[13]",
                "Obtain two instructor evaluations. These evaluations must be from an academic teacher at your college, unless you have only taken large lecture courses. In those cases, a teaching assistant can fill out the form.\n\n\nJust as with the traditional students, you may submit an optional third letter from someone other than a teacher who knows you well and can round out your character. It will neither increase or decrease your chances.[13]\n\nHave your instructors submit them online, if at all possible. Stanford is trying its hardest to go paperless and highly prefers online submission.",
                "For international students, submit the International Supplement form. This is an addition to the forms outlined in the traditional student section. Other than that, the process and expectations are no different.\n\n\nTranslation of official transcripts and teacher evaluations into English is required. Original copies of your instructions should also be translated. These translations should be by teachers or school administrators who know English well.\nYou can also take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if you are not a native English speaker. The test is not required, but is recommended.",
                "Reply to Stanford by June 1st. If you get notified that you were accepted, well, for starters, congratulations! Secondly, let them know by June 1st of your decision. The sooner you do, the sooner you can get started on living arrangements and financial aid.\n\n\nIf you don't get in, don't stress. Getting in as a transfer student is even more difficult statistically than getting in as a traditional student -- in recent years, somewhere between 1 and 4% of transfer applicants get accepted. That's because only 20 to 50 spots are open annually. If you don't get in, you're in good company."

        "How to Care for a Husky": {
            "intro": "Huskies are highly energetic working dogs, meaning they need a lot of exercise and activity to be happy.[1] They are loyal and good-natured dogs who have a genuine love for life, and lots of people want them as pets. However, Huskies can also be stubborn and quite difficult to train, so you must be up to the task. If you are considering owning a Husky, decide if you have the time, patience, energy, and dedication to help him live a long, happy, and fulfilled life.",
            "steps": [
                "Socialize your Husky puppy. Socialization teaches your puppy how to interact properly with various aspects of his environment (e.g., people, other dogs), which will help him grow into a confident and well-mannered adult dog. Allow your puppy to spend time around different people and experience various sights and sounds.[2]\n\nPuppy kindergarten class is a great way to teach your Husky puppy how to interact with other dogs.[3] Enroll your puppy Husky in puppy kindergarten when he is four to five months old.[4]\n\nOther than puppy kindergarten, you can socialize your puppy by exposing him to different situations in his environment, such as the sounds of passing cars and honking horns. You can also invite your friends over to help him become comfortable with new people.[5]\n\nTaking your puppy to a park is another good way to expose him to different people, sights, and sounds.\nObserve your puppy as he explores his new world. If he appears frightened or wary of certain experiences, do not continue to expose him to those situations.",
                "Enroll your adult Husky in an obedience training class. By nature, Huskies are very independent and intelligent dogs.[6] However, they can also be stubborn,[7] which can make training difficult. Obedience classes are ideal for training your Husky.[8]\n\nEnroll your Husky in a \"junior\" obedience class when she is 4 months old and follow up with adult training around 12 months.[9] For a well-behaved dog, it is imperative you begin training your Husky at a young age.\nBe aware that your Husky may use her intelligence to differentiate between training class and home — she may perform the training exercises perfectly in class, then misbehave when she gets home.[10] Frustrating as this may be, continue to practice and reinforce her training at home.",
                "Crate train your Husky. This is particularly important if you have a Husky puppy. Crate training will help the housetraining process go more smoothly—he will not want to urinate or defecate where he sleeps.[11] In addition, crate training will turn his crate into a safe space to go if your Husky feels scared or needs to rest.[12]\n\nYour Husky’s crate is not a place of punishment.[13] Sending him to his crate when he misbehaves may cause your Husky to develop a negative association with his crate.",
                "Leash train your Husky. If you let your Husky off her leash, she will likely dash away from you to go for a good run or happily pursue something far away.[14] She may love you as her owner, but, if given the chance, her love of running and chasing (and maybe even her predatory instincts) may take over.[15] Because of this, leash training your Husky is essential.\n\n\nLeash training will also prevent your Husky from pulling on the leash. If she begins to pull, you can either stand still and call her back to you or smoothly and immediately walk in the opposite direction of the pull.[16]\n\nDo not jerk or pull back on the leash — this may encourage your Husky to pull even harder.\nDo not use a retractable leash — this could cause your Husky to pull even more, since pulling will let her go further.[17]\n\nIf you have a puppy, let her sniff and \"explore\" her leash and collar in the house before you try walking her outside.[18]\n\nObedience training classes can help you leash train your Husky.",
                "Establish that you are your Husky’s leader. Huskies are pack animals and expect to have a clear leader of the pack.[19] Your Husky should see you as his leader. A good way to establish this leadership is to make him wait to eat.[20]\n\nBy controlling when he eats, your Husky will see you as the sole source of his food and resources, and thus his leader.[21]\n\nAnother way to establish your leadership with your Husky is to lead during your walks with him.[22] By taking the lead, you are confidently showing him that he is to follow you, rather than the other way around.\nDo not be surprised if your Husky occasionally tries to become the leader of the pack. If he does, remember to be firm and consistent with your leadership.[23]\n\n\nDo not establish your leadership through bullying or hitting your dog.[24] Your Husky is unlikely to trust and respect you as his leader if you try to establish your leadership through physical intimidation.",
                "Exercise with your Husky on a daily basis. Huskies are working dogs, with their origins in Siberia where they pulled heavy sleds over long distances.[25] Thus, it comes as no surprise that Huskies require daily, vigorous exercise (at least 30 to 60 minutes) to release pent-up energy.[26][27]\n\nLong walks are a great way to exercise your Husky.[28]\n\nTo encourage your Husky’s \"working dog\" side (and if you are feeling adventurous), tie her leash to a bicycle or wheelbarrow and let her pull you.[29] Do not attempt this if she is not well trained.\nPlaying fetch and going hiking with your Husky are other good ways to exercise her.[30][31]\n\nIf you live by the water, you can take your Husky swimming.[32]\n\nBe mindful that Huskies are very energetic dogs, and are almost always ready to play and exercise.[33] Make sure you have the energy to keep up with her!",
                "Secure your yard to prevent escape. Huskies are master escape artists.[34] If you let your Husky exercise in the backyard, prevent his escape by enclosing your yard with a six-foot fence.[35] This may not be enough, however — your Husky’s love of digging may lead him to try to dig his way out of your yard.[36]\n\nTo prevent a ‘\"digging\" escape, have your fence sunk at least several inches into the ground.[37] You could even place concrete or strong mesh wiring at the base of the fence to prevent digging.[38]\n\nContact a fencing company to reconfigure your fence such that your Husky cannot dig his way out.\nIf your Husky has managed to dig some holes, you can fill them with cinder blocks to discourage further digging.[39]\n\nAlways supervise your Husky when he is out in the yard. Although your Husky loves the outdoors, leaving him in the backyard unattended will probably make him feel lonely and bored, which could lead to destructive digging.[40]",
                "Find a playmate for your Husky. Huskies are very social animals.[41] Your Husky would love to have another dog with whom she can play and exercise. An ideal playmate will be a dog that is about the same size as your Husky and can keep up with her.[42]\n\nAllow your Husky to meet other dogs so that she can choose a playmate.[43]",
                "Do not exercise your Husky in hot weather. Huskies have a double coat, which makes them best suited for cold climates.[44] This does not necessarily mean that you should not own a Husky if you live in a warm climate — you will just need to use more caution when playing and exercising with him during the warmer months of the year.\n\n\nIf you live in a warmer climate, exercise your Husky only in the early morning when it is not too hot outside.[45]\n\nYour Husky could overheat if he is outside for too long during the heat of the summer. Try to keep him inside during the hottest part of the day.",
                "Entertain your Husky. Your Husky is very intelligent, and will need mental stimulation to keep her happily busy and entertained. Kong toys are especially good for Huskies: they are durable and mentally challenge your Husky to figure out how to get the food out.[46]\n\nFill the Kong toy with your Husky's favorite treats.\nBe mindful that Huskies can be very destructive. Choose durable chew toys that will keep your Husky busy, but cannot be easily destroyed.\nOther than toys, teaching your Husky various tricks (e.g., playing dead, playing fetch) will provide her with plenty of mental stimulation.",
                "Feed your Husky high-quality dog food. Huskies were originally bred to survive on a small amount of food. Therefore, your Husky will not need to eat a lot of calories to be healthy and have the energy to play and exercise.[47]\n\nFeed your Husky either once or twice daily and avoid exercise for at least 90 minutes after eating.[48][49]\n\nYour Husky may need more or less food, depending on such factors as her size, age, and health status.[50]\n\nIf you have a Husky puppy, begin by feeding her three times a day — early morning, early afternoon, and evening. When she is three to four months old, she will likely cut herself back to twice-daily meals.\nHuman food and canned food may cause your Husky to become a finicky eater and/or develop diarrhea.[51]\n\nIf you purchased your Husky from a breeder, he or she can recommend dog foods for your Husky to eat.[52] You can also ask your veterinarian and other Husky owners for food recommendations.",
                "Brush your Husky’s coat. By nature, Huskies are very clean dogs. They have little to no dog odor and groom themselves frequently, so you will not need to do much extra grooming.[53] However, Huskies do shed quite a bit, particularly during the spring and fall when they blow their coats (complete shedding of the undercoat).[54][55]\n\nThe \"blowing coat\" period lasts for at least three weeks.[56]\n\nBrush your Husky with a slicker brush at least once a week throughout the year to remove dead hair and keep his coat fresh and shiny.[57][58][59] Slicker brushes are available at your local pet store.\n\nDo not shave your Husky's coat in the summer. You may think that shaving his coat will help cool him off, but you are actually removing his protection from harmful ultraviolet rays.[60]",
                "Bathe your Husky. Since Huskies do an excellent job of keeping themselves so clean, they rarely need baths. You will probably need to bathe your Husky only once a year.[61] If you are not able to bathe your Husky on your own, you may prefer to take her to a dog groomer.",
                "Trim your Husky’s nails. Your Husky’s nails should be trimmed once every one to two weeks.[62] If your Husky’s energy and size make it difficult for you to trim his nails on your own, schedule a nail-trimming appointment with your veterinarian. Keep in mind that he may keep his nails naturally trimmed down with his exercise and play.[63]",
                "Brush your Husky’s teeth. If you can manage it, brush your Husky’s teeth at least two to three times a week.[64] You can purchase veterinarian-approved toothpaste through your veterinarian.[65]\n\nBrushing your dog’s teeth will not only keep her breath fresh, but will also prevent plaque and tartar buildup, both of which can lead to serious dental and systemic diseases.[66]\n\nConsider talking with your veterinarian for extra guidance on brushing your Husky’s teeth.\nIf you are not able to brush your dog’s teeth, you can schedule a dental cleaning with your veterinarian. However, this requires general anesthesia and can be very expensive."

        "How to Write a Briefing Paper": {
            "intro": "How long should your briefing paper be?",
            "steps": [
                "Determine the scope of the paper. The scope includes both the depth and breadth of the paper. How much detail will you go into? How many different topics will you cover? This will vary based on how much information you're able to find as well as how much information you'll need to include in order to support your claims.[1]\nDetermining the scope of the briefing paper is important because it will allow the reader to know exactly what information is covered and what is not.",
                "Know your audience. Before you begin writing your briefing paper, it is important to consider who will be reading it. This will drive the choices you make throughout the document. Before you start, think about the following questions, and if you don't know the answers, try to find out:[2][3]\n\nWho will read this paper? Government officials? Business executives? Journalists? Some combination of these?\nHow much does the audience already know about this issue? Do they know anything at all? What does the audience need to know?\nWhat authority does the audience have over the issue? What changes are he/she/they capable of making?",
                "Plan out key points. Before you get started writing your briefing paper, you should map out, either mentally or in an outline, the key points you want to make.\n\n\nBecause a briefing paper is typically only a page or two long, it needs to be condensed. Policy makers are very busy, and yours is not the only issue on their plates. There's no room for unnecessary information or long-winded explanations. Decide on your key points in advance to craft a concise briefing paper.[4]",
                "Consider using a template. While the formatting of a briefing paper isn't overly complex, you can save yourself some time by downloading one of the many free online templates for creating briefing papers in MS Word.[5]\n\nA template can help you organize your thoughts and more quickly craft a briefing paper.",
                "Create a name, date, and subject lines. If you aren't using a template, you 'll need to start setting up your paper by creating name, date, and subject lines.[6]\n\nThe name corresponds to the person to whom the briefing paper is addressed.\nThe date corresponds to the date on which the paper was submitted.\nThe subject line should describe in a few words the main topic of the briefing paper, such as \"The Prevalence of Bullying in the North County School District.\" This lets the reader know, without even skimming the document, the issue that will be addressed.",
                "Consider a summary section. Some briefing papers include a summary section at the start of the paper, summarizing the entire paper in a few bullet points. Decide whether you'd like to do this, and if so, set aside space for this section.[7]\n\nFor a very busy reader, the summary offers the key points in advance, thus allowing skimming over of the rest of the document.\nA well-crafted briefing paper is often concise enough that this section is unnecessary. However, for issues that require immediate action, this can be a way to highlight the urgency of the paper by clearly indicating the deadline within the summary.\nThe summary should be no more than three to four bullet points.",
                "Craft an opening that summarizes the issue. The next part of the paper must describe the issue or problem in some detail. Start with a brief opening, usually labeled \"issue\" or \"purpose\" that describes in a sentence or two the main issue the paper focuses on and/or why you are submitting this paper.[8]\n\nFor example, you might write something like: \"Violent incidents related to bullying are on the rise in schools within the North County School District. Current disciplinary policies may not be adequate for addressing this issue.\"",
                "Outline the key facts/background. The next section, labeled \"considerations\" or \"background\" should provide some detailed information about the state of the problem or issue, focusing on the recent development and/or current state of the situation.[9]\n\nThis section should include the information necessary for the reader to make a decision about this issue. Information not necessary for this purpose, however interesting it may be, should be excluded.\nIf you haven't already, do some research before writing this section. You want the information in section to be as accurate, specific, and up to date as possible.[10]\n\nWhen necessary, translate the information for your audience to make this section clear and simple. Avoid jargon, technical language, or information that isn't of central concern to the audience.[11]\n\nUse statistics and data as appropriate, but explain things in terms that your audience will be able to quickly and easily understand.",
                "Keep your opinions out. Your views on this situation and/or what should be done about it should not appear in this section. Keep it strictly factual.\n\n\nYou may, however, choose to discuss the pros and cons of various proposed or current actions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each.[12]",
                "Make it relevant. Your briefing paper should wrap up with sections labeled \"conclusion\" and/or \"recommendations\" or \"next steps.\" This closing should make it clear why this issue should be considered important by your reader.[13]\n\nTry to link the issue directly to the reader's self-interest to make your paper more persuasive.\nFor example, you might say something like: \"Bullying related incidents are leading parents to consider private school options. They are linked to lower test scores and graduation rates, making our schools appear less effective in the eyes of the community. They reduce our district's opportunities to supplement funding with federal and private grants.\"",
                "Propose a solution. Many briefing papers will provide a proposed solution to the issue that has been described, linking the issue to a policy change aimed at improving the situation.\n\n\nSome briefing papers will outline the proposed solution(s) in a section labeled \"recommendations,\" but some writers prefer \"next steps,\" believing this has a softer feel that is less presumptuous or aggressive.[14] Remember that the reader will be the one who makes the final decision on this issue, not you.\nThis section need not be \"balanced\" as the background/considerations section was. This can be a place for you to express your view as to what should be done.\nIt should be noted, however, that you do not have to endorse a particular solution. You can also just lay out some options with their pros and cons, and simply urge the reader to consider these choices and take action of some kind to address the issue. You don't necessarily specify which action would be most appropriate.",
                "Use the facts to back your argument. Your proposals in this final section should flow logically from the information presented in previous sections. Use the facts you have laid out to show why the solution you are proposing is a good one.[15]\n\nMake sure any solution you propose is clear and directly related to the issue as you have outlined it.[16] For example, imagine you have highlighted the lack of bullying prevention programs in your previous section. Here, it will make sense to suggest such a program, and perhaps point to their effectiveness at other schools. If prevention programs haven't already come up, a solution like this may feel like it came out of nowhere.",
                "Cut it down. A briefing paper should only be about two pages. If, after you are done, the paper is longer than this, your first pass through for editing purposes should look for places to cut it down.[17]\n\nLook for information that is off topic or less important and remove that material, especially if it doesn't relate to the solution(s) you offer.\nBy the same token, make sure there aren't key pieces of information missing that are necessary to make your argument clear and convincing. You may need to swap out one piece of information for another.\nTry to put yourself in the shoes of a politician or bureaucrat as you edit. Think about how many pieces of information these individuals receive every day. Don't contribute to the problem. Be part of the solution by providing the information necessary to make a decision--no more, no less.",
                "Remove technical language. As you edit, keep an eye out for technical language or jargon that could make your paper less accessible. Even if you sought to avoid this in writing the paper, it's possible that some challenging language made its way into the document.\n\n\nEspecially if you are an expert on a topic you are writing about, it's easy to forget, at least momentarily, that language that is every day for you may be difficult for others to understand.[18]\n\nKeep in mind that it is likewise not always immediately obvious why something is important to people who aren't already familiar with a topic. Policy makers usually can't be experts on every topic they have to make decisions about.",
                "Make sure the structure is logical. Ensure that the key facts you have included flow logically from the issue, as you have summarized it. Be doubly certain that any solutions you propose address those key considerations as well.[19]",
                "Carefully proofread. After dealing with the length and flow of the paper, give it one more careful look to ensure that it is free of all errors.[20]\n\nA paper with spelling, style, or grammatical errors may be taken less seriously by your reader. You may be doing more harm than good by submitting such a paper, as it may discredit your perspective."

        "wikiHow to Recognize That You Have a Crush on Someone": {
            "intro": "Sometimes, it's hard to tell if you have a crush on someone or not. This wikiHow will help you understand what a crush is and figure out whether or not you actually have a crush on someone.",
            "steps": [
                "Know what a crush is. Urban Dictionary defines a crush as “a burning desire to be with someone who you find very attractive and extremely special.”[1] Crushes make you feel crazy emotions--like feeling shy and uncontrollably giddy at the same time. You can’t always choose who you have a crush on, but you can choose how you react once you figure out that you have a crush on someone.",
                "Know that there are different kinds of crushes. The term ‘crush’ gets thrown around a lot. It can mean that you simply have a passing infatuation with someone, or that you really like him or her.\n\n\n\nThe Friendly Crush (sometimes called a \"squish\"): It is important to remember that not all strong feelings are romantic. Letting yourself trust someone and become really close to someone, without necessarily having romantic feelings for them, is a really special thing. Wanting to be around a person all the time may just mean that you have gone from friends to best friends. It's totally normal to have a friend crush - you should want to hang out with your BFF as much as possible.\n\nThe Admiration Crush: When you idolize a person (like a celebrity, teacher, or classmate who has done something really cool) you may realize that you have really intense feelings about that person and what they have done. These feelings might be mistaken for romantic feelings simply because they are so intense. Feeling slightly awed in the presence of someone who has done something amazing or can teach you great things is natural. Often, it's best to let a bit of time pass before really thinking too hard about these feelings. Generally once you have spent a lot of time with this person, you will have learned a lot from them and may begin to feel like you can stand on equal ground. You may find that your crush-like feelings simmer down once the initial awe of being in their presence wears off.\n\nThe Passing Crush: It is human nature to be attracted to other people. Even if you are in a great relationship, you still might find that you feel attracted to someone other than your romantic partner. This attraction is what we call a passing crush-- this new person may seem new and exciting, and they probably are, but that doesn’t mean you should reconsider the relationship you are in or, if you’re single, drop everything to try to be with him/her. Often times, passing crushes are spiked by being attracted--most often physically--to someone.\n\nThe Romantic Crush: Sometimes having a crush on someone really does mean you really, really like them--and in a romantic way at that. Having a romantic crush means that you want to be with that person in more than just a friendly way--you want to be their romantic partner. If you fantasize about kissing, holding hands with, or cuddling with that person, you probably have a romantic crush.",
                "Figure out how serious your crush is. By doing this, you can figure out how best to proceed--whether you should keep your feelings to yourself or share how you feel with your crush. Read the next sections to help you figure out just how strong you are crushing on that special someone.",
                "Consider your behavior around the person you think you might have a crush on. Paying attention to your physical behavior means noticing how you react instinctively when your crush is around. Different people will react differently, and generally it will be a subconscious reaction. Generally, when you have a crush you will react in one of two ways--either by becoming really shy and tongue-tied, or by becoming really outgoing.\n\n\n\nThe Shy Reaction: Do you suddenly feel like you might like to curl up into a ball when your crush is around? Do you blush incessantly and can’t seem to raise your eyes up from that suddenly very interesting speck of dirt on the ground? Do you suddenly feel like you don’t have anything witty or interesting to say? All of these reactions point towards having a crush.\n\nThe Outgoing Reaction: Do you suddenly feel the urge to tease your potential crush? When they are around, do you get the sudden urge to talk a lot because you want their attention? These are all symptoms of a crush as well. Just make sure that you don’t make your crush uncomfortable if you act this way--try not to tease them too much or they might not want to hang out with you.\n\nThe Flirty Reaction: Do you feel like you want your crush to notice what you are wearing or how your hair is done that day? Do you feel like giggling and joking around? Maybe you suddenly feel the urge to make sure you look as good as possible so that your crush will notice you. Batting your eyes, flipping your hair over your shoulder, and playing with your hair are all signs that you have a crush.",
                "Consider how you feel around your potential crush. The most common sign of having a crush is the feeling that you have a million butterflies flying around inside you when that special someone is around. It can also feel like your heart does a leap when you see your crush and you feel warm and giddy.\n\n\nDo you suddenly feel nervous but excited at the same time? Maybe you feel like you want to hug that person or be with them all the time. These are all normal reactions to having a crush.\nDo you feel like you would give up anything to be near that person?",
                "Notice how you act around your friends and your crush. Having a crush can cause you to suddenly want to be the star of the conversation, or not talk at all when your crush is around. If you are talking with a group of friends and the person you think you might have a crush on walks up do you do the following things, what do you do?[2] If so you have a crush, you will probably do one of the following:\n\n\nDo you: suddenly feel like you need to be the center of attention? You might find yourself directing the conversation so that you can talk about something cool you did in an attempt to impress your crush. You may even talk over one of your friends so that your story can be heard. You might also try to make as much contact with your crush as possible, keeping their attention on you.\nDo you: suddenly feel like you’re tongue-tied? Having a crush can sometimes make people feel embarrassed and like they don’t have anything to say. If you are normally talkative but suddenly clam up when that special person is around, you most likely have a crush.\nDo you: feel like your friends sort of disappear when your crush walks up? You may be surrounded by people but suddenly all you can see is your crush. You might smile a lot, even if what your friends are talking about isn’t funny. If your friends asked you something, would you have a hard time paying attention to the question because you’re focused on that special person? These are all signs that you have a crush.",
                "Decide whether or not you’re putting more effort into your appearance. A major sign of having a crush on someone is wanting to look nice around that person. Do you spend more time getting dressed in the morning? Have you bought new clothes you thought your crush might like? Do you spend an extra amount of time getting your hair or makeup just right, just in case you see your crush that day? If so, you most definitely have a crush.",
                "Consider whether or not your crush is all you think about. If you find yourself, thinking about that special person more than you think about anything else, you most likely have a crush.\n\n\nPerhaps you are at dinner with your family but you aren’t paying attention to the conversation because you are wondering what your crush is doing.\nMaybe you’re hanging out with your friends but secretly you wish that you were hanging out with your crush.\nWhen you are going to sleep at night, do you think about what it would be like to kiss your crush goodnight?",
                "Notice whether or not you talk about your crush a lot. Do you find yourself bringing that person up in conversation with your friends all the time? A major sign that you have a crush is when your friends tell you that you talk about that specific person all the time. If you feel comfortable doing so, it would be a good idea to talk to your best friends about thinking that you might have a crush on someone. They can help you figure your feelings out and might have some ideas about how to get to know your crush better.\n\n\nBe careful who you talk to about having a crush. Don’t just go blabbing to any random friend about your crush. If you do that, someone might tell your crush and then you might get embarrassed. Only tell your best friends--the friends you can trust the most.",
                "Consider whether or not you’ve changed anything about your life with your crush in mind. Do you have any habits or patterns you have gotten rid of or changed in the hopes of getting your crush’s attention?\n\n\nDo you walk by their locker a million times in the hopes of seeing your crush?\nHave you changed the path you take to class because you know he/she walks that way?\nYou have taken a new and deep interest in a subject that you know your crush is interested in, like photography or rock climbing.",
                "Pay attention to your internal reaction when someone brings your crush up in conversation. Often, when you have a crush, you will feel excited when your crush gets brought up in conversation. If someone mentions your crush in passing do you:\n\n\nFeel excited? Suddenly get that feeling like a bunch of butterflies are flying around your stomach? Feel like your heart might leap out of your chest? Blush and giggle? Get tongue-tied and flustered? If any of these things happen, you have a crush on someone.",
                "Pay attention to your daydreams. There is a difference between thinking about someone and daydreaming about someone. Thinking about someone means you wonder what that person is doing, or how he/she is feeling. Daydreaming is when you fantasize about things that you want to happen. People who have crushes on other people tend to daydream about their crushes a lot.\n\n\nIf you daydream about that certain someone and imagine you two going on adventures together, holding hands, kissing, or anything romantic like that, you most likely have a crush on that person.",
                "Notice if things remind you of your potential crush. Being reminded of that special someone when listing to a song, watching a movie, or reading book is a definite sign that you have a crush.[3]\n\nIf you listen to a romantic song and think, ‘Hey, that’s how I feel!’ you have a crush.\nIf you watch a movie like Titanic and envision you and your special someone as Jack and Rose, you have a crush.\nIf you read Romeo and Juliet and immediately identify with the hopelessly deep love of the main characters, you have a crush.",
                "Consider your thoughts while reading this article. While reading this, has there been one specific person on your mind while reading this article? If you answer yes, it means you have a crush on that person."

        "wikiHow to Trust Your Boyfriend": {
            "intro": "Trust is a key element in developing a strong and lasting relationship with your boyfriend. While it’s natural to worry about trust in your relationship, these concerns—if misplaced—can have damaging effects. To prevent this from happening, learn about how to trust your boyfriend, how to rebuild trust after a betrayal, and how to cope with trust issues.",
            "steps": [
                "Evaluate why you don't think you can trust your boyfriend. Before you make any drastic decisions about your relationship, it’s important to evaluate why you are having a hard time trusting your boyfriend. If you plan to talk to him about your worries, you’re going to need to be able to identify why you are feeling this way.[1]\n\nIs there something he has done that raised your doubts? Do you feel like he is avoiding you? Did someone else make a comment or indicate he was not trustworthy?\nDo you have evidence to support your concerns?",
                "Don’t jump to conclusions. Although it might depend on the reason that you don’t trust him, it’s best not to jump to conclusions that could jeopardize your relationship. Instead of reacting to your suspicions, try to think calmly and rationally about the situation.[2]\n\nIs there another explanation for your boyfriend’s behavior or your concerns? You want to make sure you get the story and your facts straight.\nHas this occurred in your relationship in the past? What was the end result?\nIf you have a good friend who usually helps you think things through, ask them for their input.",
                "Reflect on your past relationships. Before your make any assumptions about whether your boyfriend is untrustworthy, think about your past relationships. If you’ve been cheated on or betrayed in the past, it’s not uncommon to worry about whether or not you can trust your current boyfriend.[3]\n\nIf you think these past relationship issues might be influencing your ability to trust your boyfriend, make sure he’s aware of where you’re coming from. He will be better able to empathize with your situation, and you can both agree on how to interact with each other more effectively in the future.\nIf he’s not willing to be patient with your trust challenges or at least try and understand, then he might not deserve your trust.\nIf you're stuck in an emotional situation where you don't feel that you're able to move past previous trust issues, this might be a good time to speak with a therapist or counselor in order to move forward with your current or future relationships.",
                "Talk with your boyfriend about how you are feeling. Although it might seem difficult, the best way to deal with a lack of trust is to address what’s worrying you. Without being argumentative, accusatory, or negative, talk with your boyfriend about your feelings and your perceptions of his behavior.\n\n\nPsychologists often recommend that you start a conversation with an \"I feel\" statement rather than a \"You\" statement. For example, instead of accusing your boyfriend of betraying your trust, you can say \"I am feeling hurt\" or \"My concern is that we don't have the same expectations in this relationship.\" Focusing on your feelings instead of his actions, at least initially, makes the discussion seem less confrontational. As a result, your boyfriend will probably be more willing to participate in the conversation.[4]\n\nThink about how you might feel if someone accused you of being untrustworthy, and do your best to be calm and listen carefully to what he has to say.",
                "Make sure you hold yourself to the same standard. If you want to be able to trust your boyfriend, it is only fair that he be able to trust you. Hold yourself to the same standard, and do your best to be open, honest, and trustworthy.\n\n\nFor example, If you don’t want your boyfriend to text other girls, don’t text other guys.\nSimilarly, it’s not fair to be upset if he doesn’t call you if you don’t keep your promises.",
                "Make an effort to strengthen your relationship with your boyfriend. Feeling closer to your boyfriend will help you overcome trust issues in your relationship, so take the time to engage in meaningful conversation and activities with your boyfriend.\n\n\nPlan activities where you have the opportunity to talk with each other and work together. For example, take a cooking class or work on an art project together. Participate in a sports activity, but make sure you’re on the same team. The teamwork will strengthen your relationship, help you feel closer, and help you improve your communication skills.",
                "Recognize signs of more serious trust issues. While it’s normal to worry about whether or not you can trust your boyfriend or whether you trust him too much, sometimes our trust issues can become overwhelming and make it difficult to have a meaningful, lasting relationship. If you are worried about whether or not you might have more serious trust issues, it can help to recognize some of the warning signs and ask yourself these questions:[5]\n\nDoes your mistrust interfere with your relationships?\nDo you find it difficult to have friends or be intimate with people as a result of a lack of trust?\nHave your past relationships been intense, dramatic, or even violent?\nDo you worry that everyone around you is dishonest and deceitful even though you don’t have evidence this is the case?",
                "Consider where else these trust issues may come from. If you are having a hard time pinpointing a reason why you don’t trust your boyfriend, you might want to consider where else these trust issues might be coming from. Trust issues often emerge as a result of experiences and interactions early in life. Here are a few common reasons that you might be having a hard time trusting your boyfriend or other people in your life:[6][7]\n\nPeople who have been mistreated, suffered emotional or physical abuse, or dealt with rejection in their life may find it hard to trust others.\nIf you have low self-esteem or feel you are not worthy of love and affection, you might struggle with trust in your relationships.\nTraumatic events such as the death of a loved one, an illness, or a betrayal in a relationship can affect your ability to trust.\nCertain types of mental illnesses can also increase anxiety, cause delusions, or generate feelings of paranoia that make trusting others challenging.",
                "Work with a licensed mental health professional. If you are struggling to trust your boyfriend or feel you might be experiencing more significant trust issues, work with a licensed mental-health professional. They will help you explore your concerns, and can also provide support and treatment.[8]",
                "Remember that both people in the relationship need to be able to trust each other. Trust is something that is shared between two people, and it will be much easier to trust your boyfriend if you also act in a trustworthy manner.[9][10]\n\nIf you expect trust in a relationship, the other person should have the same expectations of you. You want to lead by example. So, if you worry that your boyfriend will flirt with other women, make sure you don't flirt with other men.\nOne way to develop trust in your relationship is for both you and your boyfriend to be reliable and follow through with what you say you will do. This will teach you both that you can depend on each other. For example, if you make an agreement to do something together or help with something, make sure you do it.[11][12]",
                "Make a commitment to trusting someone. Although it might sound too simple, making a commitment to trust your boyfriend will help you act accordingly. If you both agree to this, you’ve helped set expectations for your relationship.",
                "Think about your boyfriend’s feelings. An important part of learning to trust your boyfriend is thinking about how they feel and being sensitive to their emotions. If you expect your boyfriend to do this for you, then you also need to make this a priority in your relationship.[13]\n\nAn important part of this step is listening and respecting what your boyfriend thinks and feels.\nEven if you disagree with something they say, don't dismiss their feelings or act in a way that is disrespectful.",
                "Talk with each other face-to-face. Building trust requires face-to-face interaction and communication. While you might sometimes need to communicate on the phone, via text, or in emails with your boyfriend, make sure you spend time talking with each other face-to-face.\n\n\nThis will help you bond with each other and increase the sense of security in your relationship.\nIt’s much easier to trust someone when you can look them in the eye and feel confident they are telling you the truth.",
                "Make an agreement not to gossip about your relationship. Gossiping about your relationship and sharing intimate details about it with other people can erode trust. If you both make a pact not to violate this understanding, you will find it easier to trust in other ways.\n\n\nIf there’s something that you would prefer not be shared, make it clear to your boyfriend so he is aware of your expectations and wishes. At the same time, when he shares something personal with you, reassure him that you will keep his confidences.",
                "Agree to admit mistakes and apologize. Mistakes are inevitable in a relationship, and if both you and your boyfriend can acknowledge you made a mistake and sincerely apologize, you will both learn to trust each other and be more secure in your relationship.\n\n\nMany arguments can be solved more easily if both parties are willing to acknowledge that they might have done something or said something that was hurtful or inappropriate.",
                "Learn to forgive. Holding on to something that hurt your feelings or caused you pain will impede your ability to trust your boyfriend. If you’ve talked it through and he’s offered a sincere apology, then you need to try and let it go.[14]\n\nBringing up the past or injured feelings each time you have an argument makes it difficult to trust each other and communicate honestly. If your boyfriend feels like you react this way to every situation, he might not want to be honest with your or communicate openly.",
                "Make time for yourself. Spending time with your boyfriend is an important way to build trust, but you also need to make time for yourself and your family and friends. Time away from your boyfriend will help you trust your own instincts and can even provide new insights into your relationship.\n\n\nIf you have concerns about whether your trust is misplaced, talk with close friends or family about your worries. This might help you analyze your feelings and gain new perspective on whether your trust is deserved or misplaced.",
                "Keep working at it. Trust is not something that emerges overnight. Instead it requires a lot of hard work, patience, and commitment.[15]\n\nDepending on the nature of your relationship and the struggles life throws at you, expect to have doubts about whether or not you should trust your boyfriend. He will also likely experience similar doubts at one point or another. This is natural, but how you handle these doubts and concerns will determine how strong your relationship is.",
                "Talk with your boyfriend about the loss of trust. Regardless of what caused your loss of trust or the feeling of betrayal, your relationship won’t be able to move forward unless you and your boyfriend can communicate with each other about what occurred to cause a lack of trust and discuss how you are both feeling.\n\n\nMake sure you have this conversation face-to-face. Trying to communicate openly and honestly is hard to do over the phone, via email, or through text messages because you can’t look into someone’s eyes and gauge their behavior and expressions.[16]\n\nTry to be as honest as possible when you discuss these difficult topics. While it might initially be less painful to avoid analyzing or reliving a painful event, chances are good that the unpleasant questions about what happened will re-emerge if you don’t confront them head on.[17]\n\nAs calmly as you can, explain what your boyfriend did to make you feel like he betrayed your trust. Instead of making this an accusation, explain that this is something you are feeling or thinking. Open the conversation with phrases such as \"I am worried about. . .\" or \"I am concerned that. . .\" The situation might not be what you think it is, and you don't want to potentially damage your relationship. Even if your trust has been violated, accusing your boyfriend will probably make him defensive and angry, making the conversation even more unpleasant.\nIf you feel like this conversation is too difficult to have without help, set up an appointment with a counselor or therapist who can facilitate the discussion.",
                "Look for opportunities in this difficult situation. While no one wants to deal with a betrayal or loss of trust, think about the opportunities that emerge from this situation. Consider this a chance to strengthen, solidify, or rebuild your relationship and address underlying problems.\n\n\nViewing your situation in this way can help you cope with the betrayal and learn to trust your boyfriend again.",
                "Establish new guidelines for your relationship. If you've lost trust in your boyfriend as a result of a betrayal, you need to establish or negotiate new guidelines for your relationship because it’s changed and you don't want to repeat the same mistakes. Setting new terms will help make sure you are both on the same page and have the same expectations.\n\n\nThink about stressors that might have led to the feeling of betrayal or mistrust. For example, if you lost trust in your partner over an issue with money, agree on how you both will spend money in the future. Set specific guidelines and commit to following them.\nIf you never set any guidelines or rules in your relationship, this is an excellent time to start and will make sure you have the same expectations and agree on what is appropriate behavior and what is not.",
                "Be sensitive and empathetic. Regardless of who experienced a loss of trust in the relationship, you need to both be sensitive and empathetic toward each other’s feelings and concerns. This will help get your relationship back on track and improve your ability to communicate with one another.\n\n\nNo one wants to continue talking with someone who can’t be sensitive to their emotions or try to understand how their significant other feels.",
                "Learn to trust your instincts and intuition. To rebuild trust in your relationship, you’ll need to learn to trust your own instincts, which can be difficult after a betrayal. The more you trust your own ability to tell if someone is being honest and open, the more confident you can be placing trust in your boyfriend again.[18][19]\n\nTo make you more aware of what your instincts are telling you, experts suggest paying attention what your body is telling you. Do you feel a prickling sensation on your skin or a sense of physical discomfort? If so, your instincts might be telling you to be wary.[20]\n\nResearch suggests you should also pay attention to your initial reactions or first response to a situation. This doesn't mean you should fly off the handle without evidence, but consider what your inner voice might be telling you before you dismiss it.[21]",
                "Don’t let fear control your relationship. The fear of betrayal can seriously hinder your ability to trust your boyfriend and move forward with your relationship. Avoid letting your fears control your relationship and prevent you from being happy.[22]\n\nThink critically about where your fears seem to come from. Are they based in truth or do they suggest your lack of confidence in the relationship?\nTalk with your boyfriend about what you could both do to prevent these fears from gaining ground. Is there a simple way to reassure yourself or for your boyfriend to reassure you that these fears are not grounded in truth?\nThe more confidence you have in your instincts, the better able you will be to manage and handle your fears.",
                "Seek help. Rebuilding trust in a relationship is challenging, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed or ashamed about asking for help. A couples therapist, marriage counselor, or other licensed mental-health professional can help you and your boyfriend rebuild trust after a betrayal and move forward with your relationship.[23]\n\nThey are trained to deal with these situations, and having someone to mediate communication can help you and your boyfriend re-establish trust in your relationship."

        "wikiHow to Redeem Savings Bonds": {
            "intro": "If you have ever received U.S. savings bonds as gifts or purchased them yourself as a low-risk savings vehicle, you may be wondering about your options for redeeming them. Redeeming savings bonds is simple. You can redeem them at a local bank, a Federal Reserve Bank, or online.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure the bond is eligible for redemption. You can redeem EE, E, and I savings bonds 12 months after you purchase them. However, you will pay penalties and lose accrued interest if you redeem them before they fully mature.[1]\n\nRedeeming an I or EE bond before it is 5 years old will result in the loss of the last 3 months of accrued interest.[2]\n\nI and EE bonds earn interest for 30 years if you don't redeem them. All bonds are guaranteed at least their face value by 20 years.[3]",
                "Redeem the bond at the correct time of year. If you are cashing in a savings bond issued in April 1997 or earlier, then you need to redeem it in the correct time of year to make sure you don't lose interest. These bonds accrue interest every 6 months, so if you redeem it near the end of the 6 month period, you will lose that 6 month period's interest. Determine which month the bond was issued in. Redeem the bond in that month or 6 months from the issue month.\n\n\nFor example, if your bond was issued in January, you want to redeem the bond in January or July. If the bond was issued in October, you want to redeem it in either October or April.[4]",
                "Determine if you are eligible to redeem the bond. To redeem a savings bond, you must be the owner, co-owner, or entitled individual. An entitled individual includes someone with Power of Attorney or a Legal Guardian.\n\n\nIf you are a beneficiary for someone deceased, you must bring a death certificate to provide proof you can cash the bond.\nIf you are a parent or guardian, you must bring a birth certificate or other identification materials if you wish to cash the bond for your child.[5]\n\nAn owner or co-owner can cash the bond without the knowledge of the other person.[6]",
                "Visit your local bank. Go to your local bank to redeem your savings bond. If you are a customer, you may only have to have an active account and proper identification. If you are not a member of the bank, the bank may not redeem the bonds, or they might place restrictions on them, like limiting the amount they will cash.[7]\n\nContact your bank before redeeming them. Find out if they redeem savings bonds, what their dollar limit is, and what documents you need to redeem the bonds.\nIf the bank won't redeem your bonds, try the Federal Reserve Bank. You can do this electronically or by mail.[8]",
                "Have the proper identification. Bring proper identification, such as a driver's license or a social security card. When redeeming the bond at your bank, the name on the bond, the name on your account, and the name on your identification need to match. You may have to have an account at the bank for at least 6 months. If you do not have an account, you will have to show a photo ID and provide a signature.\n\n\nYou can also have an identifier take you to his bank where he has had an account for 6 months. The person with the account must have a legitimate connection to the person cashing the bond. For example, it cannot be landlord-tenant or a patron from a business. You both will be required to give name and address, relationship, and length of acquaintance.[9]\n\nYou will have to sign the \"Request for Payment\" section of the bond. Your signature will have to match the signature on file. If you are at the bank with someone with an account, he will have to sign the \"Request for Payment.\"\nThe bank will write your account number on the back of the bond. They may also write the type of identification or your address on the back.[10]",
                "Fill out a Power of Attorney form if you need to. If you are in a situation where the owner of the bond needs a Power of Attorney, such as the owner of the bond is in the hospital or home-bound, you can fill out the Power of Attorney form (PD F 5188). This form authorizes the person whose name is on the form to sell or cash the bonds.[11]\n\nAnother way to do this is to submit a certified copy of the power of attorney to the bank. The Power of Attorney document must state explicitly that you can cash the savings bonds. The document must be notarized. If you do this, only a Federal Reserve Bank can cash the bonds.[12]\n\nThis form is located through the Treasury Department website.",
                "Put in writing the child is too young to cash if cashing for a minor. If you are the parent of a child too young to sign the request form, you must provide proper identification that you are the parent.\n\n\nOn the back of the bond, you will enter something like this: I certify that I am the parent of John Doe with whom John Doe resides/to whom legal custody has been granted. He is 3 years old and is not of sufficient understanding to make this request. Nick Doe on behalf of John Doe.[13]\n\nIf a child is old enough to sign his or her own name, they can go to the bank and sign the bonds while accompanied by an adult.[14]",
                "Redeem the bonds electronically. To redeem your bonds electronically, go to the United States Treasury online marketplace, TreasuryDirect.gov. TreasuryDirect.gov gives individuals the ability to redeem their electronic savings bonds online and transfer the proceeds to a bank account. You may also request a check for the proceeds.[15]\n\nTreasuryDirect.gov also provides a service which allows you to convert your savings bond certificates into electronic savings bonds for easier filing and tracking. This will relieve you of the burden of storing your certificates. It makes redeeming bonds significantly easier.",
                "Claim earned interest on your tax return. Savings bonds earn interest during each year of ownership. For Series E/EE bonds, there is a choice for how to report interest as taxable income. Interest can be reported every year, but if this is done for one year, it must be reported every year until it reaches final maturity or until the bond is redeemed, whichever comes first. Otherwise taxes on all interest can be deferred completely until either the bond reaches final maturity or the bond is redeemed, whichever comes first.[16] That means that taxes on accrued bond interest may be due before the bond is redeemed. Interest is reportable as taxable income on line 8a of the federal Form 1040."

            "intro": "How do you perform a side crunch?",
            "steps": [
                "Lie on your back on the floor. Using a mat or carpeted surface is more comfortable, but make sure it doesn't have too much cushioning.\n\nFor more resistance, you can try these on a declined bench.\nSome people prefer to do crunches on a stability ball.",
                "Bend your knees. Your feet can be flat on the floor, or you can keep them suspended in the air during your crunches for a little extra crunch.",
                "Cross your arms in front of your chest. You can also place your hands behind your neck or head, but many people tend to pull their head or neck up during the exercise, which can place extra strain on the spine.[1] Your head and neck should be resting on your hands.\n\nFor increased resistance, you hold a weight on your chest or behind your head.",
                "Lift your shoulders towards the ceiling using your abdominal muscles and pause at the peak. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. When your shoulders are off the ground, pause and hold that position for a full second (or more).\n\n\nIt can be tempting to move your head forward (tucking in your chin to your chest) because it makes you feel like you're lifting further, but you're not. It's a bad habit that increases your chance of getting injured. One good way to prevent this is to always try to keep looking up at the ceiling.\nIf you have your hands behind your head or neck, don't let your elbows come together. Keep them level with your ears. Letting your arms close in around your head encourages your head to tilt forward.\nExhale and contract your abs as you go up.\nIf you are learning How to Take a Punch, you can do what Muay Thai fighters do: have someone hit your stomach while it's fully contracted to condition your core to take hits.",
                "Ease back down slowly as you inhale. Don't just \"plop\" back down. Your control on the way down works your ab muscles as well.[2]\n\nRelax your abs before doing another crunch.",
                "Lie on your back on the floor. Put your hands on your stomach or palms down at your sides.[3]",
                "Lift your feet off the floor. You can either have your knees bent at a 90 degree angle, or you can point your feet in the air with your legs as straight as you can get them.[4]",
                "Lift your hips off the ground, using your abs. Be careful not to push down with your hands, back, or head. If you can't lift your hips using just your abs, you'll need to build more strength with regular crunches. Otherwise, you're just wasting energy while other parts of your body do the work.",
                "Do a twist crunch. Follow the steps for regular crunches, but instead of lifting both shoulders off the ground equally, lift one shoulder towards the opposite direction (left shoulder towards right, right shoulder towards left). Alternate shoulders. This targets the obliques (the muscles at your sides).",
                "Do a side crunch. Follow the steps for regular crunches, but lean both legs to one side (still bent, knees together, close to floor). Lift both shoulders off the ground simultaneously like in a regular crunch. Since your torso is twisted, you will feel it in your side. Do several crunches on one side, then move your legs over and repeat on the other side.",
                "Do a cable crunch. Stand and hold onto a cable. Pull the weight down by curling your back and engaging your abs."

        "How to Quickly Regain Your Balance": {
            "intro": "We've all been there: You're casually strolling down a hallway or sidewalk when suddenly, for no apparent reason, you forget how to walk and go plummeting toward the ground. Although most falls don't give you much time to think about what to do, there are some things you can quickly do to regain your balance the next time gravity works against you. There are also some exercises that can help you regain some lost stability resulting from aging or an injury or illness that has weakened your balance.[1] Learn how to prevent accidental falls while saving yourself some pain and a bruised ego in the process.",
            "steps": [
                "Plant your airborne foot. Unless you get knocked off your feet by a very strong force, you will likely still have one foot on the ground when you begin to fall. If possible, bring your airborne foot to the ground as quickly as possible. It is much easier to stabilize yourself on two feet than one.\n\n\nThis might not be enough to save you from falling in situations where the ground is slippery (say, an icy sidewalk) or the ground is uneven or sloped.\nYou are better off planting your foot a fair distance (12 inches or more) away from your other foot. A wider stance provides more stability.\nPlant your airborne foot in the direction you are falling. If your center of gravity is moving forward, but you plant your foot behind you, this won't improve your balance. This may not be possible in sideways falls where your airborne foot is on the opposite side as the direction of your fall.",
                "Squat down. Once you have two feet on the ground, bend at the knees and hips to lower your body toward the ground. This will lower your center of gravity, making it easier to stabilize yourself. This also uses your legs as shock absorbers to soften the impact to your joints of stumbling or falling.\n\n\nMake a conscious effort to bend at your waist and lean your torso opposite to the direction you are falling. This will further adjust your center of gravity and stabilize you. Just be sure not to overcompensate, as this could make you fall the other way.\nThis step is most effective on flat ground, where you are most likely to be able to squat down quickly without hurting your knees.\nIf you are a taller person, you may need to squat lower than someone who is shorter, as your center of gravity is naturally higher off the ground.",
                "Use your arms to distribute your weight. Most people instinctively reach out when falling off balance to either grab a nearby object or counter-balance themselves against the direction of the fall. Sticking out your arms away from the direction your body is moving will help quickly offset your shifting center of mass. This way, you are fighting your body's tendency to let its mass be pulled down by gravity.\n\n\nKeep in mind that anything you might be holding onto when you lose your balance could end up going flying when you thrust out your arms. If possible, hold onto it for even greater counter-balancing potential. You'll need all the help you can get!\nThis action is what gives falling people their signature flailing appearance, and you'll probably agree that it doesn't exactly look graceful. Nevertheless, it's better than the alternative.",
                "Grab onto something sturdy. As mentioned above, your natural tendency when falling will be to reach out and catch yourself on something. Go with this. If you can get a hand on something stable enough to support you while you regain your balance, you are much more likely not to fall. You will, however, have to be lucky enough to be within reach of something when you begin to fall.\n\n\nWalls, trees, railings, fences, parked cars, and even other people are good examples of things sturdy enough to catch yourself on. Just be aware that another person might go down with you instead.\nSome things may seem stable enough to hold onto but may tip over once pulled or pushed on with force. This is usually not something you have time to evaluate when falling, but it is worth being aware of.\nThis is another action that could carry the consequence of accidentally throwing or crushing whatever you're holding at the time, as your natural reflex will cause you to rapidly extend your arm while opening your reaching hand.",
                "Adjust to uneven ground. Unfortunately, you will not always be standing on flat, smooth ground when losing your balance. If you are on stairs, boulders, or some other uneven surface when you begin to fall, you will need to adjust your balance-recovery strategy. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n\nPlant your feet on surfaces or objects that are as even with one another as possible. This will keep you from pulling yourself off balance even more while trying to plant your feet. If this is not possible, bend your knees and hips to counteract the different ground heights you're standing on.\nIn some cases, it might be best to transfer your landing into a jog or run instead of a stationary position. This is likely to be a good option if you lose your balance while on unstable ground (like a rocky hillside) or when your body is already moving with some momentum.\nIf you are slowly losing your balance, evaluate whether your landing will be more stable or safer by jumping as you fall. This way you can have a little extra time to reset your center of mass and land on two feet in a more or less vertical position. This is also useful in the event that you are near flat ground but not standing on it when you begin to fall.",
                "Wear appropriate shoes. In some cases, being thrown off balance can be kept from turning into an actual fall by having on footwear suited to your activity. This is especially likely to prevent slips. If you are involved in an activity that puts you at greater risk of losing balance, chances are there is a shoe designed specifically for it that will improve your stability as much as possible.\n\n\nObviously, not all falls occur during risky activities. You should not design your wardrobe or life around the relatively small chance that you could lose your balance at some point. Just be smart about your footwear when the situation calls for it. For example, don't wear sandals while walking on ice.\nChoose footwear that is not likely to actually cause a fall. Many loose-fitting shoes (including flip-flops and most other sandals) could cause you to lose your balance if they come off at an inopportune moment. Again, just don't wear loose shoes while playing sports or doing anything else that elevates your risk of falling.",
                "Look before you leap. A lot of falls occur when the person simply isn't looking where they're going. Minimize your risk by watching your step, especially in slippery or dimly-lit conditions. Being generally aware of your surroundings is good advice anyway, and will also help you more easily recover your balance if you do stumble.\n\n\nWhen walking or moving around at night, use a flashlight or headlamp (if the situation calls for it). Casting light on the ground in front of you will majorly decrease your likelihood of taking a spill.\nWhen walking down stairs, it is an especially good idea to look at the step in front of the one you're currently standing on. If you look at the spot where you intend to step, your brain will do a much better job of telling your foot where to go than if you just settle into a rhythm of bouncing down the steps.",
                "Stay put when impaired. Sometimes people take medications or consume other substances that decrease their ability to maintain balance. If you are under the influence of alcohol or medications that cause instability and reduce reaction times, your best bet for reducing your chance of a fall is to minimize your movement, especially if you are by yourself.\n\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to sit in a padded recliner if you have had a few drinks, but try to avoid walking long distances or participating in activities that involve lots of moving around on two feet.\nUse extra caution when walking down stairs. This can be particularly dangerous if you have impaired balance.",
                "Use handrails. Almost all staircases and other inclined pathways (such as ramps) have handrails along their lengths, often bolted to a wall or other sturdy structure -- and for good reason. Hold onto these when moving down (or up) a steeply inclined path so you have an automatic safety net if you start to lose your balance. Gravity quickly takes over if you fall on stairs; don't let it win!\n\n\nSlide your hand along the railing as you move down the stairway instead of taking it off completely. This minimizes the likelihood that you could fall while repositioning your hand.\nCheck that the railing feels secure. If your railing is not stable or well-attached, it won't do you much good if you use it to catch yourself. If it is not secure, use the one on the other side. If this is not an option, proceed cautiously.",
                "Protect your face. If you do fall all the way to the ground, protect your face and head above all else by covering them with your hands/arms. You should do this even if it means you could sustain an injury to another body part in the process. Head injuries can be very dangerous or fatal, so keep your head off the ground and away from any other hard, immobile objects.\n\n\nWhen falling forward, bring your hands in front of your face. This can serve the dual purpose of helping you catch yourself and protecting your face at the same time.\nWhen falling backward, put your hands behind your head and bend at the waist. This is the best way to keep your head off the ground and cushion the impact if you do make contact.",
                "Consider your limits. In some cases, moving quickly to avoid falling could be almost as likely to cause injury as the fall itself. This is often the case for elderly people or those with pre-existing injuries. If you are likely to throw out your back by contorting to maintain your balance, there's a chance you're better off taking the fall and walking away with some minor scrapes and bruises instead.\n\n\nMuch of your movement while losing balance is a reflex to the situation. As such, you might not be able to avoid a quick body adjustment, even if you are trying to avoid it.\nIf you do have to allow yourself to fall to avoid a potentially more serious injury, try to land in a way that avoids sensitive areas or older injuries. For example, if you have a torn knee ligament that isn't quite healed, you might not want to plant that foot and should avoid hitting the ground with that knee by turning your injured body part away from the ground as you fall.",
                "Use your arms as shock absorbers. If you fall forward to the ground, allow your arms to compress somewhat once your hands or forearms make contact. Think of this as doing a reverse push-up, where you are applying resistance to your arms but allowing them to flex to absorb the impact. This can help prevent arm bone fractures and will generally soften your landing.\n\n\nAny time you catch yourself with your hands or arms during a fall, there is a chance you could break a bone in your arm, hand, or wrist. While this is a risk nobody wants to take, it very well could be your best option to avoid more serious injury.\nYour risk of breaking a bone is higher if you brace your fall at an awkward angle, such as behind you while falling backward. This is because your arms are not suited to hard impacts while extended behind you, and your joints don't easily bend while in that position.\nThe stronger you are in your upper body, the more effective this technique will be in helping you keep from being hurt in a fall.",
                "Roll with it. If you fall to the ground with some momentum (such as if you trip while running or fall off a tall object), you might be able to minimize your risk of injury by letting yourself roll on the ground instead of trying to come to a sudden stop. If you try to do this, just make sure you are protecting your head and neck.\n\n\nContact the ground with your hands first, then your upper back/shoulder blade area. Try not to roll past your feet, as this could cause you to land on your face and defeat the purpose of rolling with your fall!\nWhen rolling forward (or end over end), arch your back and duck your head while bending at the waist. The more you can make yourself into a ball shape, the more easily you'll roll.\nWhen rolling onto your side (or barrel-rolling), keep your arms flexed and tucked in, with your hands over your face and your head ducked slightly forward. This will protect your face while keeping the back of your head off the ground.",
                "Practice weight shifts. To do this, stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly shift your weight from one side to the other, lifting your opposite foot off the ground and holding the position for as long as possible (up to 30 seconds) before switching to the other leg. Repeat this exercise as many times as you feel comfortable.[2]\n\nStand near a stable object or wall if needed so you can grab onto it for stability if you start to fall.\nIncrease your repetitions to boost the difficulty of this exercise as your balance improves.\nChoose a slightly unstable surface to stand on, such as a pillow or a BOSU ball for an even greater challenge.",
                "Do single-leg balancing. To begin this exercise, stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips. While staying upright, raise one foot off the ground and bend your knee so your raised foot is behind you. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds, then switch to the other foot. Repeat this exercise until you've done each foot several times.[3][4]\n\nFor an added challenge, you can try reaching your airborne foot to the side or in front of you without touching it to the ground. This forces your balancing muscles to engage as you shift your center of gravity away from your body.\nStand on an unstable surface or attach weights to your ankles to make this exercise more difficult.",
                "Do single-legged bicep curls. Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and grasping a dumbbell in one hand. Hold the dumbbell so that your elbow is bent at 90 degrees and your palm is facing upward. Lift one leg off the ground and hold that position for up to 30 seconds before repeating on the other side.[5]\n\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by gradually increasing the weight of the dumbbell. You can also try doing full bicep curls instead of keeping your elbow bent at 90 degrees. This will cause your muscles to constantly correct for the shifting weight.\nTry variations to this exercise, such as changing which leg you raise off the ground. It will be harder to lift the leg on the same side as the dumbbell, so work up to this if you can't do it when you first start exercising.",
                "Walk straight lines heel-to-toe. You can work on improving your balance and test how far you've come by practicing walking in a straight line while placing one foot directly in front of the other with the heel of your front foot almost touching the toes of your back foot. Raise your arms to the side and hold them at shoulder height.[6][7]\n\nKeep your eyes focused on a point far in front of you for added stability. Looking at your feet will make it harder to balance.\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by moving very slowly or pausing with one foot in the air during each step.\nTurn around at some point along the line you've walked without breaking your posture and go back the other way."

        "How to Stop Over Thinking in a Relationship": {
            "intro": "Maybe you’re in a relationship with someone you don’t trust completely and you find that your thoughts often run wild. If they don’t pick up the phone, you might immediately think they're cheating or doing something sketchy. However, this kind of thinking can hurt you and your relationships and you’re probably eager to make a change. Overcome these thoughts by putting them to rest, balancing your mind, and creating a stronger relationship with your partner.",
            "steps": [
                "Take several deep breaths. Once your thoughts start to run away from you, take a few deep breaths. The more you breathe, the calmer you’ll feel. Breathe in deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth for three seconds each until you feel settled.[1]",
                "Find a quick fix to your worries. Often, the things you worry about might have several immediate solutions. Instead of letting your thoughts get carried away, do something to address them! You’ll feel better once you take action.\n\n\nFor instance, if your partner isn’t responding to your texts, call them to see if everything is okay.\nIf they still don’t answer, set a timer on your phone for one hour and do something else during that time. Take a hot bath, get in a nap, or watch a few episodes of your favorite show. You can call back when the timer goes off, but they’ll probably have already called you!",
                "Counteract your negative thoughts with responses. When your thoughts begin to spiral, confront them head-on. Instead of allowing yourself to think of the worst-case scenario, consider the most realistic explanation instead.[2]\n\nFor instance, if you haven’t heard from your significant other for hours, you might think they’re cheating. But, if you know they had a busy day at work, realize that they might’ve gone home to nap.",
                "Find something to make you laugh. Laughter truly is the best medicine. Sometimes you might overthink simply because you're in a bad mood. Improve your mood by finding some funny videos to watch online.[3]",
                "Distract yourself. Rather than freaking yourself out, do something fun or productive. Blast some music and have a mini dance party or call your mom to check in. You can also take a nice, hot shower or get some sunlight.[4]\n\nDistraction is okay to use temporarily, but you should ultimately address the underlying worry causing your thoughts and feelings. If these issues are not addressed, it can cause you and your partner to become irritated with each other and the lack of trust may continue to build as a result.",
                "Phone a friend who will talk you off the ledge. Talking to your friends may help you think more rationally. If you're freaking out, call one up to see if your worry is realistic. If not, let it go and find something else to do. Only phone friends who are wise and trustful and avoid calling fellow over thinkers.[5]",
                "Seek the help of a counselor if you think you have anxiety. If you find that your worries never go away or often worsen, you might be dealing with anxiety. It’s normal to have worries in relationships, but if you have a hard time overcoming them or if they are interfering with your happiness and productivity, it’s okay to get some help. Many counselors can help you work through your problems and create healthy relationships.[6]\n\nIf you’re in college, many universities offer free therapy. If you are employed, search on your insurance’s webpage for therapists who accept your insurance. You can also do a Google search of the term “therapists in” followed by your area code.",
                "Practice meditation daily. Meditation helps to quiet negative thoughts in your head and improve your focus. Each day, take at least ten minutes and sit in a quiet space where you will be uninterrupted and focus on nothing but your body and your breaths.[7]\n\nIf you haven't ever meditated, use an app like Headspace or Calm.",
                "Put down your phone more often. Your overthinking might be triggered in part by an attachment to your phone. You might find yourself looking at it every minute for a call or text from your partner. Instead of obsessing over communicating with them, unplug sometimes.[8]\n\nLeave your phone at home occasionally when going out with friends. Put it on silent when working or watching your favorite show.",
                "Repeat positive mantras to yourself daily. Your overthinking might come from a self esteem issue. You may worry that you don’t measure up or that your partner deserves better. To combat these thoughts, repeat mantras to yourself in the mornings or when you feel down.[9]\n\nYou might say “I am beautiful. I am intelligent. I am worthy of love.”",
                "Make time for yourself apart from your partner. You might want to spend all your free time with your partner just so you can keep an eye on them. Though spending time together is good, your relationship with yourself is critical. Take at least one day a week to do something that’s just for you. Remember that you’re not just a person in a relationship; you have a whole identity apart from that.[10]\n\nSpend time doing your favorite hobbies like reading, writing, running, or dancing.\nThe more activities you do outside of your relationship, the less time you will have to overthink.",
                "Take care of yourself. It’s difficult to have a healthy mind if your physical health is in disarray. Try to get at least seven hours of sleep a night, exercise three times a week, and eat a healthy diet.[11]\n\nTry to exercise for at least thirty minutes per day. Start off by jogging in your neighborhood. Later, join a gym and do some exercise classes. Yoga is another great option that can be done from home.",
                "Think about what may be causing your concerns. Become aware of yourself and what your concerns are that are causing you to overthink in your relationship. You cannot address these concerns without first knowing what they are. Consider writing down your concerns whenever you catch yourself feeling worried or distrustful. Then reflect on what you’ve written down.\n\nFor example, you may discover that your concerns are about not being good enough for your partner and feeling unworthy of them.",
                "Celebrate the good in your relationship. Even though you overthink, your relationship likely has some great qualities. Maybe your partner is very thoughtful or you two have a lot of fun together. Spend time doing things you both enjoy and let your partner know you appreciate them.[12]\n\nGo to amusement parks, paint classes, or the movies.\nTo show appreciation, say “Babe, thanks so much for always making sure I have a good dinner. I appreciate it.”",
                "Have a conversation about both of your needs. Your overthinking might come from some unresolved issue in your relationship. Talk to your partner openly and honestly about what you need from them. Listen to their needs as well. Find ways to compromise with one another so you can both be happy.[13]\n\nFor instance, perhaps it bothers you when your partner doesn’t call after getting home from a night out. Ask if they can call or text you when they get home from now on.\nFind out what changes your partner would like you to make. Say, “I know I might be asking a lot of you, but I’m willing to make some changes, too. What would you like from me?” He might ask for a bit of space from you, and that’s okay! Give it to him and allow him time to miss you.\nKeep in mind that the point of a relationship is to share and experience each other's company, not to fix your own personal problems. Only you can do that for yourself.",
                "Keep busy when your partner is away. When your partner is away on a trip or out with friends, avoid hitting them up every few minutes to check in. Allow them their space so they can enjoy their time away. Go out with your own friends, deep clean your home, or find something else to do to occupy your time.[14]",
                "Take your partner at their word. Instead of taking a microscope and looking for holes in every story your partner tells you, trust them. Believe them until they give you a reason not to. A lack of trust will eat you and your relationship alive. When questionable situations do arise, ask them for the truth and believe what they say.[15]\n\nHowever, if you have overwhelming proof that they are lying, it might be time to end the relationship.",
                "Communicate when issues arise. Instead of blowing their phone up or hurling accusations, talk out your problems. Wait until they have had time to relax after work or school and bring up the issue.[16]\n\nSay “Hey babe, I didn’t want to bother you while you were at work, but I’ve been thinking about last night. It bothered me that you yelled. I know you were mad, but that isn’t okay with me.”",
                "Practice vulnerability in the relationship. Vulnerability is the willingness to share yourself authentically and expose your flaws, secrets, and darker sides without feeling shame. Being vulnerable allows for trust building and paves the way for a closer relationship. Try to openly communicate your needs, feelings, and wants to your partner instead of keeping them to yourself. It takes a certain amount of courage and risk initially to be open and genuine, but the payoff will likely result in more trust and less overthinking.[17]",
                "Evaluate the person you’re with if your trust has been broken. Maybe overthinking has been a part of every relationship you’ve had, or perhaps it is a more recent development. Your overthinking may come from being with someone who is undeserving of your trust. Instead of being with someone who cheats, lies or breaks promises, end the relationship. Choose partners who are reliable and honest in the future. And remember - it’s not the end of the world, just a lesson learned.[18]\n\nEven if your partner hasn’t broken your trust, it may be right to end the relationship if it’s causing more harm than good. If you’re dealing with a lot of stress as a result of overthinking in the relationship, it may be helpful to make a list of the pros and cons of your relationship to decide whether or not you should stay in it."

            "intro": "When you've decided you're ready to start a family, you want the process to be as easy and stress-free as possible. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to speed everything along. When you take measures to improve your fertility, time your ovulation cycle, and have intercourse effectively, you could be preparing for your bundle of joy in no time.",
            "steps": [
                "Cut back on the caffeine. Too much caffeine can limit your fertility. Aim for no more than 500 mg per day. If you brew your own coffee at home, this is about five cups. However, if you grab your java at the local coffee shop, that 16-ounce serving of latte or Americano should be your limit for the day.[1]",
                "Eat nutritious foods. You should always eat a balanced diet. Aim for a variety of foods that will help you get your daily requirements of iron, calcium, folic acid, and protein. You can get these nutrients from raisins, dark leafy greens, legumes, broccoli, and fortified whole grain breads. Omega-3 fatty acids are also important. If you're vegan, you don't have to start eating fish for omega-3s. You can get them from flax seeds and walnuts.[2]",
                "Achieve a healthy body weight. If you're overweight, it could take you twice as long to get pregnant as it would for a woman of normal weight. If you're underweight, it could take you four times as long. Talk to your doctor about an exercise regimen that will help you achieve a normal Body Mass Index (BMI).[3]\n\nIf you are a healthy body weight, keep your diet consistent and healthy.",
                "Limit your alcohol intake. The jury is still out as to how much (or if) alcohol limits your fertility. However, you should still err on the side of safety. If you decide to consume alcohol, one drink (12 fl oz./355mL regular beer, 5 fl oz./148mL table wine, 1.5 fl oz./44mL distilled spirits) per day should be your limit.[4]",
                "Stop smoking. If you smoke, quit the moment you decide you want to have a baby. Smoking could make you less fertile and increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. It's also known to cause a host of birth defects, such as low birth weight and underdeveloped lungs.\n\n\nIf you have a partner, they should quit, too. Secondhand smoke is just as dangerous as primary smoke. If your partner is the intended father, smoking can slow down his sperm.[5]",
                "Take prenatal vitamins. Prenatal vitamins prepare your body for the task of nourishing an extra person. They also contain extra folic acid, which can prevent spina bifida in the developing fetus. Because spina bifida often develops before a woman know she's pregnant, doctors recommend taking a prenatal vitamin as soon as you decide you want to start a family.[6]",
                "Visit your doctor. They'll probably do a full exam and go over your medical history. Tell them about Let them know if you're taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements. They'll tell you which ones you'll need to stop taking and which ones are safe. Let them also know about your:\n\n\nReproductive issues, including past pregnancies, miscarriages, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, endometriosis, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or reproductive cancer.\nVaccination history, especially vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella. If you contract these illnesses during pregnancy, they can harm the fetus.\nFamily medical history, including siblings or parents who have had cancer, heart disease, or genetic abnormalities.\nExercise habits.\nPartner's medical history, if applicable. This includes low sperm count, history of measles, mumps, rubella, or other illnesses that can affect fertility.[7]",
                "Seek a specialist if necessary. Women's fertility steadily decreases after the age of 35. For men, the effects are less clear. If you're under 35, try to conceive for a year before you see a doctor for fertility testing. If you're over 35, wait six months. See your family doctor or regular gynecologist first. They'll refer you to a specialist if you need to see one. Give your doctor details about every measure you've taken to conceive. The most common tests you'll undergo are:[8]\n\nPap smear to check for cervical cancer.\nUrine test to check for chlamydia, which can block your fallopian tubes.\nBlood test during your period to check for hormonal imbalances.\nBlood test during or after your period to test for ovulation.\nBlood test at any time during your cycle to check for rubella.",
                "Stop using hormonal birth control. These methods (pills, patch, intrauterine contraceptive, Depo-Provera, etc.) can alter your menstrual cycle. To plan your pregnancy, you'll need to know the length of your cycle and how long your periods last without birth control. If you were on the Pill or the patch, your body might need extra time to re-regulate.\n\n\nIf you need another month or two, use a condom. Each woman's body is unique. Some women have to wait up to a year after stopping their birth control, while others can get pregnant immediately.[9]",
                "Count the days of your menstrual cycle. If your cycle is regular, you may be able to determine your egg's next release through your Fallopian tubes with simple math. If your cycle is 28 days long, you'll probably ovulate on day 14. A good rule of thumb is to count back 16 days from the first day of your next period. You'll probably ovulate up to five days after that day.[10]\n\nThere are also plenty of calculators available online.",
                "Chart your basal body temperature. Your basal temperature (lowest body temperature in any given 24-hour period) will rise 0.2 degrees F (0.11 degrees C) a few days after you ovulate. Only use a basal thermometer. You're looking for fluctuations that are smaller than a degree, which are difficult to see on a regular thermometer. You can find a basal thermometer at your local drug store or big box store.[11]",
                "Check your cervical mucous. Monitor color and texture. Your mucous will increase and be most slippery around the time of your ovulation. If you can stretch it between your fingers, you probably are ovulating. These changes can be difficult to detect, so monitor for them often.[12]",
                "Buy an ovulation kit. Ovulation prediction kits can predict a released egg a day in advance. It uses the same methodology as a pregnancy test. However, they can cost anywhere from $20 to $50. You can buy them in your local drug store.\n\n\nOvulation kits test levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. This means you'll have to urinate on a stick. Unfortunately, it's not 100 percent accurate, so don't depend only on this method.[13]",
                "Start having intercourse before you ovulate. Sperm can survive for up to five days in your body. Therefore, if you aim for two to three days before to the day of ovulation, you should be able to get pregnant. If you want to play it safe, have intercourse every day or every other day during the second and third weeks of your cycle.[14]",
                "Skip the lubricants. Artificial lubricants can slow down or kill sperm. Instead, have your partner make time for foreplay. However, if you need a lubricant, go for something natural like mineral oil or canola oil.[15]",
                "Relax. When you're stressed, it can mess with your cycle. Calm down and have fun. If your life is full of undue stress, try picking up yoga or another meditation practice. Taking just 15 minutes out of your day to calm yourself can help greatly.[16]"
