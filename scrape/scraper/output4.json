            "steps": [
                "Increase your caloric consumption. For example, if you are currently consuming 2,000 calories a day, boost that to about 2,500 calories or even more. But make sure that you're eating clean, and are not eating too much.",
                "Get enough protein to support muscle growth. Aim for between 1-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For example, if you weigh 180lb, take in at least 81-146g of protein every day.\n\n\nOne ounce (28 grams) of cooked meat contains roughly 7 grams of protein.[1] You could meet an 80 gram daily goal with two 6-oz. steaks, assuming no other protein sources.",
                "Drink enough water. The body needs a sufficient amount of water to build muscle at an optimal rate. Here's a great little formula to help make sure you are getting enough:[2]\n\nImperial units: Bodyweight in lbs X 0.6 = water intake in ounces.\nThe same formula in metric units: Bodyweight in kg x 40 = water intake in milliliters.\nThis includes all water from food and drink, not just glasses of water.\nIf you are over 30, you can lower these numbers to lbs x 0.46 to 0.54, or kg x 30 to 35.[3]",
                "Eat regularly. Rather than having two or three large meals during the day—something we've grown up with—change your eating habits so that you are eating five or six smaller meals during the day.\n\n\nTo help keep your protein intake high, one or two of those meals can be a protein shake. Here's one example, though a quick Internet search will uncover hundreds of delicious protein shakes:\n8oz skimmed milk\n1 banana\n1 tbsp peanut butter\n2 scoops of protein powder",
                "Eat healthy fats. That's right—not only does it make food taste good, fat is good for you, as long as you are eating the right kinds and amounts of fat! Saturated fats—the fat you'll find in a stick of butter, a bag of chips, or bacon—should be limited to about 20g or less. That's the bad news. The good news is that unsaturated fats are actually beneficial, even necessary. Fat is necessary for the proper distribution of vitamins A, D, E, and K, helps promote better eyesight, and healthy skin. Depending on your total caloric intake, 50-70g of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat is beneficial for your training, and your overall general health.\n\n\nMonounsaturated fats can be found in olive, canola, and sesame oils; avocado; and nuts such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pistachios.\nPolyunsaturated fats are found in corn, cottonseed, and safflower oils; sunflower seeds and oils; flaxseed and flaxseed oil; soybeans and soybean oil.\nOmega-3 fats, an overall winner of a fat that is very beneficial to heart and blood health, eyesight, and for children, brain development. You'll find this fat in many omega-3-enriched foods. Another great source is fatty cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, trout, and sardines.\nA good way to determine how much fat in grams you should be taking in is to multiply your calorie intake by 0.001 for maximum trans-fats; by 0.008 for maximum saturated fats; and by 0.03 for the \"good fats\". For example, for a 2,500-calorie diet, you would limit trans-fats to 3g or less, saturated fats to 20g or less, and up to 75g of mono- and polyunsaturated fats.",
                "Take your vitamins. In addition to a well-balanced diet, include a multivitamin supplement to your dietary regimen. It will ensure that your body is getting the full amount of vitamins and minerals it needs to stay healthy. There are many options, depending on your age, your sex, and your particular health and diet needs. Find the one that's right for you, and make it part of your daily routine.",
                "Build an effective exercise routine. A good diet is required for your body to be able to maximize your potential, but there's no potential at all until you start the process of tearing down your old muscles and rebuilding them bigger, bulkier, and stronger. The best way to do that is to start at the beginning.",
                "Warm up. Before you begin any exercise routine, whether it is a simple jog or a 300lb deadlift, start with a low-intensity routine designed to warm up all the muscles you're about to work on. Not only will it help you get into the right frame of mind, it can help prevent injuries.\n\n\nYou should never stretch a cold muscle. Research has shown that pre-workout stretching, contrary to public opinion, does not prevent injury and may, in fact, result in poorer performance. Stretching is best done following a workout.",
                "Work harder, but shorter. Training with high reps is good for building endurance, but it won't help you build up either size or strength. Instead, aim for about 3-8 sets per muscle group, and 6-12 reps per set for your normal routine. Your final rep should be very hard to complete! If it's not, increase the weight you're lifting.\n\n\nLimit your overall training to about 45 minutes a day.\nEvery 4-8 weeks, vary your routine. As your body adapts to stress, you'll hit a plateau where the benefits of weight training will begin to diminish. The only way to prevent this from happening is to change things up, such as by increasing weight and changing exercises. Try a week of really piling the weights on, and do six to eight reps per set at the maximum weight you can manage with proper form. The more lifting experience you have, the more often you should vary your routine.",
                "Work your whole body. You'll see the maximum benefit when your entire body is part of the routine. The more muscles you use when training, the more hormones you will produce (including epinephrine and norepinephrine), which in turn stimulates muscle growth both while you exercise and for the entire day.\n\n\nGive all muscle groups equal attention, such as five sets of rows after five sets of bench presses. This will encourage balanced training, growth, and flexibility.\nCompound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, and pull-ups use a lot of different muscles.\nYou can work the entire body in each session, or divide your sessions between, for example, the upper body one day, and the lower body the next.\nDon't rush. Advanced lifters often base their routines around a technique called explosive repetition. In other words, they lift a tremendous amount of weight in a short (explosive) amount of time. There are significant benefits to this method, but the risk of injury in novice athletes is high. It is recommended solely for more advanced athletes.",
                "Include cardio training. Good cardiovascular health improves blood flow, a requirement for muscle growth. The standard recommendation is 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week, or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio, or an equivalent combination of the two. Examples of cardio include running, biking, swimming, and any sport that involves constant movement.\n\n\nCardio burns calories quickly, so overdoing it can limit the energy available to build your muscles. If you increase the amount of cardio exercise you do, be sure to increase your calories intake as well.",
                "Get your rest. Your body needs time to recover, and to repair (build) your muscles, and to do that you will need at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Avoid caffeine and alcohol for deeper sleep.\n\n\nIn addition to the proper amount of sleep, do not overdo your training regimen. While you might be tempted to think that \"more is better,\" in fact the opposite is true. You can reach a point known as \"over-training\", in which you'll lose the ability to \"pump\", (engorge the muscles with oxygen-rich blood), and can even lead to muscle wasting—exactly the opposite of what you are trying to achieve. Here are some symptoms to be aware of if you think you may be falling into the over-training zone:\n\nChronic fatigue\nStrength loss\nLoss of appetite\nInsomnia\nDepression\nLowered sex drive\nChronic soreness\nProne to injury",
                "Schedule your workouts. To avoid over-training, set up a schedule that works for you and your goals. Here is an example of a split routine that gives you plenty of time to break down your muscles, and plenty of time off to let them recover, even larger than before:\n\n\nDay 1: Chest and biceps, followed by 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio.\nDay 2: Back and triceps, followed by 30 minutes of moderate intensity cardio.\nDay 3: Legs and abs, followed by 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio.\nDay 4: Shoulders\nDay 5 – Day 7, rest.",
                "Lower your stress levels. Whether your stress comes from job, home, or just the way you're wired, do what you can to reduce or eliminate it. It's not just good for you in general, but stress increases the production of the hormone cortisol, a hormone that encourages your body to store fat and burn muscle tissue.",
                "Practice explosive lifts. \"Exploding\" upward while lifting trains your muscles for quick, explosive strength. However, this increases the risk of injury if you do not use the correct technique. If you want to add these to your squats or other range of motion exercises, practice first with a lighter weight and a low-intensity set up:\n\n\nWork up to the explosive part of the move gradually by starting with a smaller range of motion, and increase it with time and practice.\nMove slowly on the eccentric (the lowering phase). This is the part of motion which causes the most tearing, so don't try to \"explode\" downward.\n\"Load the muscle\" at the low point of the exercise. This means holding the muscle contraction before beginning the movement.\nExplode upward quickly, but avoid full extension at the peak range of motion. For example, knees should stay slightly bent for leg exercises, and elbows slightly bent for upper body exercises.",
                "Build your back muscles. These exercise build the major muscles of your back, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and teres major:\n\n\n\nPerform bent over rows. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, about 6 to 10 inches (15–25 cm) behind the barbell or two dumbbells. Bend slightly at the knees but keep your shins vertical. Bend forward at the waist with your spine and head straight. Lift the weight with an overhand grip up to your lower chest or upper abdomen. Lower slowly until your arms are nearly extended, without touching the ground. 3 x 8.[4]\n\nDo pull-ups to build your lats. Jump onto or grab hold of a horizontal bar that is comfortably taller than you. Lift your legs back so that you are hanging from the bar. With your hands shoulder-width apart, and your palms facing toward you, lift your chin up to the bar using only your arms. 3 x 8.",
                "Target your pecs with chest exercises. The bench-press is the most dependable way to gain chest muscle, although there are lots of different exercises for the chest.\n\n\nDo push-ups. Combine push-ups with other chest exercises, or do them independently. Keep your arms at shoulder-width when you lower yourself down. The closer your hands are to one another, the more you'll work your triceps.\nFor the bench-press, start with a weight that you can lift comfortably. If you are a beginner, try lifting the bar along with 5lbs or 10lbs on each side. With arms at shoulder-width apart, grab onto the bar and slowly lower the bar until it's at nipple level; push up until your arms are fully extended upwards. Do 8–10 repetitions (reps) like this for three sets (3 x 8), adding additional weight each set. Once you have a few months of practice, slowly increase weight and go down to 6–8 reps per set, aiming to reach muscle failure at the end of the third set.\nLift weights on the incline bench press. The incline is like the bench press, but one end of the bench is tilted about 40 degrees. Do 3 x 8. It will be harder to lift the bar on an incline, so start out with less weight than you would on the flat bench-press.",
                "Work your leg muscles. Here are four different exercises to build and strengthen your leg muscles. Choose a selection that works your quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings:\n\n\n\nDo deadlifts to work the back of the thigh, the glutes and calves. Lift a barbell or two dumbbells from the ground to a standing position, then lowering the weight steadily down again. Keep your back straight and leave your arms extended, engaging your legs and back instead.\nDo standard squats with a weighted bar. Place enough weight on a bar and rack so that it's a little lower than shoulder height. It should be heavy enough that doing a squat is difficult, but not impossible. If you're a beginner, this may mean using a bar without any weight to start with. Duck under the bar and stand up so that the bar rests comfortably on your trapezius muscles, just below the neck. Keep your knees slightly bent and your legs slightly wider than shoulder width. Lift the bar up off the rack and move backwards one step.\n\nSlowly bring the weight down by bending your knees. Keep your chest, knees, and feet aligned vertically, with your hips back.\nArch your back slightly but keep your torso as erect as possible, with your head in line with the spine.\nBring your butt down, keeping the tension on the leg muscles. A 90 degree bend at the knees is the safest option. With experience and practice some people can safely lower past the 90 degree bend, but it is not required for perfect form.\nExhale deeply and use your legs and hips, not your back, to lift out of the squat. 3 x 8.\n\n\nDo front squats with a weighted bar. Rack a weighted bar at just-below shoulder-level. Come up to the bar from the front, positioning the bar on the front shoulders. Cross your arms over onto the bar and walk it out. Keeping your back straight, bend your legs into a squat, with your hips under the bar. Lift and repeat 3 x 8.\nDo Belgian squats (or \"single leg squats\") with a dumbbell. Hold out in front of your chest a dumbbell using both hands. Standing in front of a bench, lift your right leg back so that it's parallel to the floor and resting comfortably on the bench. Bend into a squat using the left leg, so that the right knee almost hits the floor. Lift and repeat 3 x 8. Repeat using opposite leg.",
                "Target your biceps with arm exercises. Dumbbell arm curls are one of the most effective way to improve strength in your biceps. As with all exercises, build muscle by steadily increasing the weight you lift.\n\n\nDo individual arm curls with dumbbells. Sit down on a bench and grab onto a dumbbell on the ground, with your hand in between your thighs. With your elbow resting on your thigh, lift the dumbbell all the way to the upper chest by curling your arm upward. Switch to the opposite hand and repeat. 3 x 8.\nDo arm curls on a weighted bar. Standing up, grab hold of a weighted bar with both hands. Let the arms extend all the way down to the thighs. Using only your arms, lift the weight up to your chest by curling your arms upward. 3 x 8.",
                "Target your triceps with arm exercises. Dips are probably the most effective way to work your triceps, which is the muscle beneath your biceps. You'll need to have strong triceps to bench-press large amounts of weight.\n\n\nTo do dips, place your hands at shoulder-width apart on a bench, with your body and feet stretched out in front of the bench. Slowly bend your elbows and lower your body down so that your butt nearly touches the floor. Lift back up with your arms to starting position; repeat, doing 3 x 8. If this isn't a high-intensity set for you, increase the resistance by lifting one foot off the floor.\nAlternately, you can do a chest dip on a dip machine, grabbing hold of two beams, bending your feet back off the ground, and lowering your body until your knees nearly touch the ground. Lift back up with your arms until they are straight.\nDo skull crushers. Lay down flat on a bench with a bar. Bend your elbows so that the bar is about a couple inches from your forehead. Slowly push the bar up until your arms are fully extended before bringing the weight back down. Keep your elbows close together. Repeat 3 x 8.",
                "Do an overhead press to build your shoulders. Hold a barbell or two dumbbells at chest or shoulder height, with your palms facing forward. Lift the weight above your head until your arms are fully extended, with a slight bend in the elbow to prevent hyperextension. 3 x 8.\n\n\nVariations include changes to the hand and palm position, lifting the dumbbells until they touch overhead, or lifting into a wide \"Y\" shape with your arms.",
                "Target abdominal muscles with crunches and core exercises. Your abs define the muscles on your stomach, giving you that chiseled 6-pack look. There are a variety of exercises that work out your abdominals. Here are a couple.\n\n\nDo standard/oblique crunches. Lie down on a mat and position both arms behind your head without locking the hands. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the ground. Pushing the small of your back into the ground, slowly roll your shoulders off the ground only a couple of inches (not to a full sitting position). Don't use your momentum to help you up; use slow, regulated movements. Repeat 3 x 20.\n\nFor oblique crunches, angle your torso so one shoulder reaches toward the opposite knee. Alternate sides after each crunch.\n\n\nDo planks to work the abs and the core. Lie face-down on the floor. Lift yourself up so that your body is still parallel to the floor, with your forearms (flat on the floor) and your toes supporting your weight. Keep your body straight and hold your position for as long as possible."

            "intro": "Painting a dog portrait can be a challenging endeavor for a beginner, but very rewarding when you can capture your dog's individual personality. This tutorial will guide you through the process of painting any breed of dog.",
            "steps": [
                "Practice drawing straight lines. Take a piece of paper and draw randomly spaced dots around the edges. Practice drawing straight lines between all the dots––this will come in handy when you are finding the proportions and placing the features of the dog’s head.",
                "Practice color mixing. Use a simple computer painting program to print out a sheet of small, randomly-colored squares. Mix small portions of these colors as accurately as you can with your chosen opaque paint.\n\n\nEven if you work digitally, buy some cheap paints and practice mixing. Being able to identify the mixing components of a color is extremely helpful for matching the colors of your subject.\nIf you are doing opaque painting, you need to try coloring on the actual material that you want to paint on. This will allow you to foresee how the material absorbs and paints diffuse which can help you to create different effects.",
                "Choose a reference image. Creating a painting that looks three-dimensional is easier if you can accurately judge the forms of your subject. Good lighting is a key factor to doing this well.\n\n\nChoose a reference image that features a single, strong, direct light source that creates a clear separation of light and shadow. You can identify a direct light source by looking for hard-edged cast shadows.\nA simple, uniform background makes it easier to see the outline of the subject.",
                "Map out the proportions of your subject. Ensure that the proportions of your painted subject are correct by mapping out key features in the reference for comparison.\n\n\nLook for major lines of action (red lines) such as the center line of the head or the tilt of the eyes. When sketching in other features, compare their placement and orientation to these lines.\nNote the angles (blue lines) that parts of the head make with each other - these angles remain the same regardless of the size of your painting. Pick out spots that are easy to keep track of, such as the points of the ears, the nostrils, and hard corners where the jaw and collar overlap with the neck.\nNegative space (yellow area) is the shape created by the area around the subject. In many cases, negative space is far simpler and easier to judge than the shapes inside the subject.",
                "Sketch the under-structure. Begin by drawing the major lines of action.\n\n\nDraw straight lines between the key features, making sure the angles are accurate.\nUsing simple lines makes it easy to adjust proportions before drawing in more complicated forms.\nResist drawing small details and focus instead on correctly placing the biggest forms.\nThe sketch should show accurate proportions. Keep adjusting your guidelines until all the forms are the correct size.",
                "Identify basic light, medium, and dark value areas in the reference. Understanding how light is hitting your subject is the most important factor in making your painting look three-dimensional. Light value areas are most directly facing the light source. There are two types of medium value areas:\n\n\nPlanes of the form that are turning away from the light and about to go into shadow.\nLight is bouncing off of objects behind the subject and hitting them from the opposite side, but much less strongly than the direct light. This is called “reflected light.”\nDark value areas are where the least amount of light is shining on the subject because the planes of the form are tangent to the light sources, so they aren’t getting light from either the front or back. They occur between medium value areas and are called “core shadows.\"",
                "Paint in the basic values on your under-structure sketch.\n\n\nMix 4 neutral (gray) values: light, medium, dark and a background value. Don’t try to perfectly match any values because this under-painting will be completely covered by the final colors. The different value areas are only an organizational tool.\nApply the values using the sketch as a guide. Working with only four values makes this step simple and fast.\nUse a large brush.\nIf you have trouble placing the medium values, try painting only light and dark first before adding medium.\nStep back 10 feet/3 meters from the painting to get an overall impression. The painting should begin look like a three-dimensional form with light shining on it.",
                "Start applying color using your under-painting as a guide. This is where the painting begins to really look like the dog reference. Using the reference for comparison, mix colors for each value section defined by your under-painting, and lay in the colors within the pre-mapped areas with a large brush.\n\n\nAfter the biggest areas are painted, layer on additional colors, but keep using the large brush.",
                "Identify large plane boundaries in the reference and sketch them into the painting as a guide. With all the large shapes in place, switch down to a medium brush and start refining the edges of major forms, such as the jaw and large skin creases.\n\n\nIt may be useful to sketch guidelines into the painting, as they can easily be covered up with a new layer.\nStep back 10 feet/3 meters from the painting. The illusion of light should be very strong. You might forget the shadows are only painted.",
                "Add detail to the nose and mouth. As with the rest of the body, the tongue and nose can be broken down into larger planes to plan out the form. Once you have them looking as if light is shining on them, go in with even finer details.\n\n\nTo make the snout look wet, look at your reference for the placement of small, bright, hard highlights. These are called “specular reflections”. They occur where the light source is being completely reflected off the surface.",
                "Add detail to the eyes. Note that the “white” of the eye is rarely white under normal lighting conditions because it is recessed into the head and cast into shadow by the skin around it. Capturing these shadows is the key to making the eye appear to be set in the face and not just painted on the surface.\n\n\nSmall, bright specular highlights give the eye a glassy sparkle.",
                "Add detail to the ears. The ears are composed of a few large planes that turn up at the edges.\n\n\nBe sure to establish the forms before adding graphic elements like spots, and remember that the spots are affected by the light and shadow of the plane they are on as well.",

        "How to Quickly Regain Your Balance": {
            "intro": "We've all been there: You're casually strolling down a hallway or sidewalk when suddenly, for no apparent reason, you forget how to walk and go plummeting toward the ground. Although most falls don't give you much time to think about what to do, there are some things you can quickly do to regain your balance the next time gravity works against you. There are also some exercises that can help you regain some lost stability resulting from aging or an injury or illness that has weakened your balance.[1] Learn how to prevent accidental falls while saving yourself some pain and a bruised ego in the process.",
            "steps": [
                "Plant your airborne foot. Unless you get knocked off your feet by a very strong force, you will likely still have one foot on the ground when you begin to fall. If possible, bring your airborne foot to the ground as quickly as possible. It is much easier to stabilize yourself on two feet than one.\n\n\nThis might not be enough to save you from falling in situations where the ground is slippery (say, an icy sidewalk) or the ground is uneven or sloped.\nYou are better off planting your foot a fair distance (12 inches or more) away from your other foot. A wider stance provides more stability.\nPlant your airborne foot in the direction you are falling. If your center of gravity is moving forward, but you plant your foot behind you, this won't improve your balance. This may not be possible in sideways falls where your airborne foot is on the opposite side as the direction of your fall.",
                "Squat down. Once you have two feet on the ground, bend at the knees and hips to lower your body toward the ground. This will lower your center of gravity, making it easier to stabilize yourself. This also uses your legs as shock absorbers to soften the impact to your joints of stumbling or falling.\n\n\nMake a conscious effort to bend at your waist and lean your torso opposite to the direction you are falling. This will further adjust your center of gravity and stabilize you. Just be sure not to overcompensate, as this could make you fall the other way.\nThis step is most effective on flat ground, where you are most likely to be able to squat down quickly without hurting your knees.\nIf you are a taller person, you may need to squat lower than someone who is shorter, as your center of gravity is naturally higher off the ground.",
                "Use your arms to distribute your weight. Most people instinctively reach out when falling off balance to either grab a nearby object or counter-balance themselves against the direction of the fall. Sticking out your arms away from the direction your body is moving will help quickly offset your shifting center of mass. This way, you are fighting your body's tendency to let its mass be pulled down by gravity.\n\n\nKeep in mind that anything you might be holding onto when you lose your balance could end up going flying when you thrust out your arms. If possible, hold onto it for even greater counter-balancing potential. You'll need all the help you can get!\nThis action is what gives falling people their signature flailing appearance, and you'll probably agree that it doesn't exactly look graceful. Nevertheless, it's better than the alternative.",
                "Grab onto something sturdy. As mentioned above, your natural tendency when falling will be to reach out and catch yourself on something. Go with this. If you can get a hand on something stable enough to support you while you regain your balance, you are much more likely not to fall. You will, however, have to be lucky enough to be within reach of something when you begin to fall.\n\n\nWalls, trees, railings, fences, parked cars, and even other people are good examples of things sturdy enough to catch yourself on. Just be aware that another person might go down with you instead.\nSome things may seem stable enough to hold onto but may tip over once pulled or pushed on with force. This is usually not something you have time to evaluate when falling, but it is worth being aware of.\nThis is another action that could carry the consequence of accidentally throwing or crushing whatever you're holding at the time, as your natural reflex will cause you to rapidly extend your arm while opening your reaching hand.",
                "Adjust to uneven ground. Unfortunately, you will not always be standing on flat, smooth ground when losing your balance. If you are on stairs, boulders, or some other uneven surface when you begin to fall, you will need to adjust your balance-recovery strategy. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n\nPlant your feet on surfaces or objects that are as even with one another as possible. This will keep you from pulling yourself off balance even more while trying to plant your feet. If this is not possible, bend your knees and hips to counteract the different ground heights you're standing on.\nIn some cases, it might be best to transfer your landing into a jog or run instead of a stationary position. This is likely to be a good option if you lose your balance while on unstable ground (like a rocky hillside) or when your body is already moving with some momentum.\nIf you are slowly losing your balance, evaluate whether your landing will be more stable or safer by jumping as you fall. This way you can have a little extra time to reset your center of mass and land on two feet in a more or less vertical position. This is also useful in the event that you are near flat ground but not standing on it when you begin to fall.",
                "Wear appropriate shoes. In some cases, being thrown off balance can be kept from turning into an actual fall by having on footwear suited to your activity. This is especially likely to prevent slips. If you are involved in an activity that puts you at greater risk of losing balance, chances are there is a shoe designed specifically for it that will improve your stability as much as possible.\n\n\nObviously, not all falls occur during risky activities. You should not design your wardrobe or life around the relatively small chance that you could lose your balance at some point. Just be smart about your footwear when the situation calls for it. For example, don't wear sandals while walking on ice.\nChoose footwear that is not likely to actually cause a fall. Many loose-fitting shoes (including flip-flops and most other sandals) could cause you to lose your balance if they come off at an inopportune moment. Again, just don't wear loose shoes while playing sports or doing anything else that elevates your risk of falling.",
                "Look before you leap. A lot of falls occur when the person simply isn't looking where they're going. Minimize your risk by watching your step, especially in slippery or dimly-lit conditions. Being generally aware of your surroundings is good advice anyway, and will also help you more easily recover your balance if you do stumble.\n\n\nWhen walking or moving around at night, use a flashlight or headlamp (if the situation calls for it). Casting light on the ground in front of you will majorly decrease your likelihood of taking a spill.\nWhen walking down stairs, it is an especially good idea to look at the step in front of the one you're currently standing on. If you look at the spot where you intend to step, your brain will do a much better job of telling your foot where to go than if you just settle into a rhythm of bouncing down the steps.",
                "Stay put when impaired. Sometimes people take medications or consume other substances that decrease their ability to maintain balance. If you are under the influence of alcohol or medications that cause instability and reduce reaction times, your best bet for reducing your chance of a fall is to minimize your movement, especially if you are by yourself.\n\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to sit in a padded recliner if you have had a few drinks, but try to avoid walking long distances or participating in activities that involve lots of moving around on two feet.\nUse extra caution when walking down stairs. This can be particularly dangerous if you have impaired balance.",
                "Use handrails. Almost all staircases and other inclined pathways (such as ramps) have handrails along their lengths, often bolted to a wall or other sturdy structure -- and for good reason. Hold onto these when moving down (or up) a steeply inclined path so you have an automatic safety net if you start to lose your balance. Gravity quickly takes over if you fall on stairs; don't let it win!\n\n\nSlide your hand along the railing as you move down the stairway instead of taking it off completely. This minimizes the likelihood that you could fall while repositioning your hand.\nCheck that the railing feels secure. If your railing is not stable or well-attached, it won't do you much good if you use it to catch yourself. If it is not secure, use the one on the other side. If this is not an option, proceed cautiously.",
                "Protect your face. If you do fall all the way to the ground, protect your face and head above all else by covering them with your hands/arms. You should do this even if it means you could sustain an injury to another body part in the process. Head injuries can be very dangerous or fatal, so keep your head off the ground and away from any other hard, immobile objects.\n\n\nWhen falling forward, bring your hands in front of your face. This can serve the dual purpose of helping you catch yourself and protecting your face at the same time.\nWhen falling backward, put your hands behind your head and bend at the waist. This is the best way to keep your head off the ground and cushion the impact if you do make contact.",
                "Consider your limits. In some cases, moving quickly to avoid falling could be almost as likely to cause injury as the fall itself. This is often the case for elderly people or those with pre-existing injuries. If you are likely to throw out your back by contorting to maintain your balance, there's a chance you're better off taking the fall and walking away with some minor scrapes and bruises instead.\n\n\nMuch of your movement while losing balance is a reflex to the situation. As such, you might not be able to avoid a quick body adjustment, even if you are trying to avoid it.\nIf you do have to allow yourself to fall to avoid a potentially more serious injury, try to land in a way that avoids sensitive areas or older injuries. For example, if you have a torn knee ligament that isn't quite healed, you might not want to plant that foot and should avoid hitting the ground with that knee by turning your injured body part away from the ground as you fall.",
                "Use your arms as shock absorbers. If you fall forward to the ground, allow your arms to compress somewhat once your hands or forearms make contact. Think of this as doing a reverse push-up, where you are applying resistance to your arms but allowing them to flex to absorb the impact. This can help prevent arm bone fractures and will generally soften your landing.\n\n\nAny time you catch yourself with your hands or arms during a fall, there is a chance you could break a bone in your arm, hand, or wrist. While this is a risk nobody wants to take, it very well could be your best option to avoid more serious injury.\nYour risk of breaking a bone is higher if you brace your fall at an awkward angle, such as behind you while falling backward. This is because your arms are not suited to hard impacts while extended behind you, and your joints don't easily bend while in that position.\nThe stronger you are in your upper body, the more effective this technique will be in helping you keep from being hurt in a fall.",
                "Roll with it. If you fall to the ground with some momentum (such as if you trip while running or fall off a tall object), you might be able to minimize your risk of injury by letting yourself roll on the ground instead of trying to come to a sudden stop. If you try to do this, just make sure you are protecting your head and neck.\n\n\nContact the ground with your hands first, then your upper back/shoulder blade area. Try not to roll past your feet, as this could cause you to land on your face and defeat the purpose of rolling with your fall!\nWhen rolling forward (or end over end), arch your back and duck your head while bending at the waist. The more you can make yourself into a ball shape, the more easily you'll roll.\nWhen rolling onto your side (or barrel-rolling), keep your arms flexed and tucked in, with your hands over your face and your head ducked slightly forward. This will protect your face while keeping the back of your head off the ground.",
                "Practice weight shifts. To do this, stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly shift your weight from one side to the other, lifting your opposite foot off the ground and holding the position for as long as possible (up to 30 seconds) before switching to the other leg. Repeat this exercise as many times as you feel comfortable.[2]\n\nStand near a stable object or wall if needed so you can grab onto it for stability if you start to fall.\nIncrease your repetitions to boost the difficulty of this exercise as your balance improves.\nChoose a slightly unstable surface to stand on, such as a pillow or a BOSU ball for an even greater challenge.",
                "Do single-leg balancing. To begin this exercise, stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips. While staying upright, raise one foot off the ground and bend your knee so your raised foot is behind you. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds, then switch to the other foot. Repeat this exercise until you've done each foot several times.[3][4]\n\nFor an added challenge, you can try reaching your airborne foot to the side or in front of you without touching it to the ground. This forces your balancing muscles to engage as you shift your center of gravity away from your body.\nStand on an unstable surface or attach weights to your ankles to make this exercise more difficult.",
                "Do single-legged bicep curls. Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and grasping a dumbbell in one hand. Hold the dumbbell so that your elbow is bent at 90 degrees and your palm is facing upward. Lift one leg off the ground and hold that position for up to 30 seconds before repeating on the other side.[5]\n\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by gradually increasing the weight of the dumbbell. You can also try doing full bicep curls instead of keeping your elbow bent at 90 degrees. This will cause your muscles to constantly correct for the shifting weight.\nTry variations to this exercise, such as changing which leg you raise off the ground. It will be harder to lift the leg on the same side as the dumbbell, so work up to this if you can't do it when you first start exercising.",
                "Walk straight lines heel-to-toe. You can work on improving your balance and test how far you've come by practicing walking in a straight line while placing one foot directly in front of the other with the heel of your front foot almost touching the toes of your back foot. Raise your arms to the side and hold them at shoulder height.[6][7]\n\nKeep your eyes focused on a point far in front of you for added stability. Looking at your feet will make it harder to balance.\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by moving very slowly or pausing with one foot in the air during each step.\nTurn around at some point along the line you've walked without breaking your posture and go back the other way."

        "wikiHow to Pit Olives": {
            "intro": "Pitting olives can be a difficult experience because the seed (also called \"pit\") is usually attached so firmly inside the olive. Many people try to pit olives by trying to peel away the exterior edible portion (known as the fruit), however since this causes damage to the fruit, the correct way to pit an olive is to push out the pit through the side of the olive. This can be done using basic kitchen utensils or specialized tools, depending on the amount of time you want to spend on pitting each olive.",

                "Find a large chef knife. If you don't have a chef knife you can use any other object with a hard flat surface.",

                "Maneuver the pit out of the olive with your fingers if it still hasn't popped out. Try to take out the pit in 1 piece while causing the least damage to the fruit.",
                "Purchase an olive pitter if you find pitting with a chef knife too difficult or time-consuming. This kitchen tool can pit olives using the following procedure.\n\n\nPlace the olive securely inside the small bowl at the end of the olive pitter.\nSqueeze on the handles at the other end. This punches a small hole at the end of the olive.\nContinue to squeeze the handles until the pit is forced out of the punched hole and drops to the bottom of the bowl.\nRelease the handle to drop the loose fruit into a separate bowl and discard the pit that is left behind.",
                "Consider using an olive-pitting machine if you need to pit olives quickly and frequently. These machines can be bulky and expensive and are usually only used by restaurants and food suppliers. Some machines used for olive pitting can pit over 2,000 olives per minute."

        "wikiHow to Sell a Mobile Home": {
            "intro": "While perhaps not as difficult as selling your own fixed-residence abode, selling a mobile home still takes some planning. To make sure you get the best possible price with the least amount of hassle, you can learn to prepare the mobile home for the sale, advertise it effectively, and close the deal yourself. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Clean your mobile home thoroughly. Before you get your mobile valued or attempt to list it or show it to anyone, spend a good amount of time cleaning it thoroughly, from top to bottom. Remove unwanted clutter by finding an off-site storage location, such as a storage locker, or with other family if you need to. A clean home will sell much faster than one that looks like it needs care.\n\n\nPut yourself in the perspective of a potential buyer. It's important to vacuum up any pet hair and deodorize the carpet, making the mobile home the most welcoming and clean version of itself. Your windows, your bathrooms and your kitchen should be spotless if you hope to sell it for a good price.",
                "Make any necessary repairs before listing the property. Pay particular attention to leveling issues, plumbing problems, and any other fixable features that will make someone think twice about buying your mobile home. Even though it's unfortunate to have to spend money fixing up something you're not going to live in anymore, you'll be raising the potential asking price of the mobile home by investing in it now.[1]\n\nTaking sneaky hide-the-leaky-fixture pictures may seem like a good idea to get around making repairs, but anyone that hires an inspector before making a purchase will find them, and ask you to fix them anyway. Sell your mobile home the right way and take care of issues that need to be addressed.",
                "Determine the value of the mobile home. Before you list the mobile home, you need to find out how much it's worth and how much you still owe on it, if any. Determine your asking price by consulting with your lending institution to find out what you still owe on your loan for the home and/or the property.\n\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get a quote on the value is to hire an inspector to assess the property. Property inspection is a likely step a potential buyer would take, so furnishing your own results is a good way to stay ahead of the game and even convince buyers not to do it, helping your negotiating standing.\nHome valuation reports are also available quickly and cheaply online. You might consider checking out mobilehome.net, accessed here.",
                "Consult with your lot manager to see if there are any neighborhood or sign restrictions before you post any for sale signage. If it is appropriate and OK with the place where your mobile home resides, place your sale sign in the yard or a front window.\n\n\nIf your mobile home is located in a mobile home or RV community, you need to let the management know as soon as possible that you're planning on selling the vehicle, and determine whether or not a potential buyer wishes to live in the same mobile home park. In most parks, the buyer will need to submit a written application and be accepted if they wish to keep the mobile home in the park.[2]",
                "Take listing photographs. Your first impression on a potential buyer is always the most important, so take a variety of high-quality pictures that will make your house look attractive and desirable. Take the pictures of the house immediately after cleaning it, and ideally take pictures when you've cleaned out most or all of your belongings.",
                "Advertise your mobile home online and in the trades. The best way to attract potential buyers is to list your mobile home on a database of homes, like Mobile Homes By Owner, found here as well as any other local trade papers and classifieds that will print short ads. The more places you list your mobile home, the more likely it will sell quickly.\n\n\nTo list your mobile home online, you'll sometimes have to select between particular plans. Usually you'll either choose an economy plan that allows for one photo, or choose the premium plan that allows more photos at a higher price. With either choice, your ad can stay on the site for the set price until it sells.\nIt's also a good idea to explore free options like Craigslist, which allow you to quickly write up the ad and make it as long and detailed as you want. Since trade papers usually charge per word, the ads tend to be clipped and super brief, making them sometimes frustrating to read.",
                "Be available for inspections and showings. Get ready: if you've done your job right, you're going to have a lot of people getting in touch and wanting to check out your mobile home, walk through, and call with specific questions. Try to set aside specific hours to schedule showings, or even consider holding an \"open house\" so everyone can show up and check out the property at the same time.\n\n\nBe both firm and flexible and consider negotiating the price. Don't let yourself get pushed around, but don't turn away serious offers either, even if they're somewhat south of what you initially hoped to get. Ending the sale is better than dragging it out.",
                "Close the deal. When you find someone willing to make an offer that you think is acceptable, fill out the necessary paperwork to make the deal complete. Select an acceptable move-in date and turn the keys over to the new owner of the mobile home.",
                "Transfer the title to the new owner. All ownership documentation needs to be transferred to the new owner. Depending on the model of mobile home you're selling, you probably have a title, similar to a vehicle title, that you need to transfer to the new owner. You can do this by obtaining the transfer form from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and signing it over to the buyer.[3]",
                "Provide a certificate of occupancy, if necessary. In certain states, a certificate of occupancy or a proof of residence must be present at the premises, which you can transfer over to the new owner. The purpose of the document is to act as a record of the residents at a particular location, for the purposes of insurance and zoning.",
                "Furnish a bill of sale. Any time a major sale is completed, you need to furnish a Bill of Sale to the buyer to make it legal and make the transaction binding. This is an important step to guard yourself against the possibility of litigation or dispute in the event that the buyer changes their mind regarding the purchase. Contact the commerce secretary in your state to learn more about the proper forms and procedures for completing a bill of sale in your state.",
                "Consider hiring a realtor if you can't close the deal. Selling a home of any kind by yourself can take up lots of time. If you're busy with work, kids, or other responsibilities, it can be too much. Don't invest all of your time in the sale of the mobile home, if you can turn some of the responsibilities over to a professional realtor who can do the job for you and get it done quickly and efficiently."

                "Use a good facial toner. Get a little cotton pad and put a little bit of the toner onto it and then wipe it all over your face. This leaves your face cool and refreshed while evening out your complexion and removing any dirt your cleanser has missed.",
                "Use moisturiser. Find a moisturiser that's good for your skin type. Most skin care brands make a moisturiser for all types of skin.

To do this, get a little bit on your ring finger and pat it under your eye.",

Put just little onto the back of your hand, then with a foundation brush start applying it around the nose than work outwards, only use a little because it's easier to apply more than to remove it. Make sure it is properly blended so that it does not look like you're wearing anything on your face.",
                "Use concealer if you need it. Find one that brightens for under your eyes. You can either use a brush or your finger. If you're using a brush, put a little concealer on your hand then dab the brush in it and use light feathery strokes to apply it under your eyes, around your nose and on any blemishes. If you are using your finger do the exact same thing but try to pat it in as that will give better coverage.",

Apply it with a fluffy angled brush; either apply it where the sun would normally hit (your cheeks, forehead, and nose) or apply it in the hollows of your cheekbones to give yourself a more sculptured face. For blush, you can either apply it on the apples of your cheeks or just below your cheekbones all the way up to your hairline.",

For powder, use a little angled brush and again use light feathery strokes and brush through after.",

        "wikiHow to Curve Grades": {
            "intro": "A grade curve is a relative grading procedure that assigns grades for assignments based on the performance of the class as a whole. There are many reasons a teacher or professor may decide to curve a grade - for instance, if the majority of students performed below what was expected, which may imply that an assignment or test was out of range in either scope or difficulty. Some curving methods adjust grades mathematically, while others simply allow opportunities for students to recoup some of the points they lost on an assignment. Read on for detailed instructions.",
            "steps": [
                "Set the highest grade as \"100%\". This is one of the most common (if not the most common) methods teachers and professors use for curving grades. This curving method requires the teacher to find the highest score in the class and set this as the \"new\" 100% for the assignment. This means that you subtract the highest score in the class from the hypothetical \"perfect\" score, then add the difference to every assignment, including the highest-scoring one. If done correctly, the highest-scoring assignment will now have a perfect score and every other assignment will have a higher score than it previously did.\n\n\nFor example, let's say the highest grade on a test was a 95%. In this case, because 100-95 = 5, we would add 5 percentage points to all of the student grades. This makes the 95% score an adjusted 100%, and every other score 5 percentage points higher than it was.\nThis method also works using absolute scores, rather than percentages. If the highest grade was a 28/30, for instance, you would add 2 points to the score of every assignment.",
                "Implement a flat-scale curve. This technique is among the simplest of the methods used to curve grades. It is especially useful for when there was one especially difficult item on an assignment that a large majority of the class missed. To curve grades according to a flat-scale curve, simply add the same number of points to each student's grade. This can be the number of points that an item most of the class missed was worth, or it can be some other (arbitrary) number of points that you think is fair.\n\n\nFor instance, let's say that the entire class missed one problem which was worth 10 points. In this case, you might choose to add 10 points to every student's score. If you think the class doesn't deserve full credit for the missed problem, you might also choose to only give out 5 points.\nThis method is closely related to previous method, but it isn't exactly the same. Because this method doesn't specifically set the highest score in the class as a 100% maximum score, it allows for the possibility that none of the assignments receive a perfect score. It even allows for scores over 100%!",
                "Set a bottom limit for F's. This curving method mitigates the effect that a few very low scores can have on a student's grade. Therefore, it's especially useful in situations where a student (or an entire class) bombed a certain assignment but have since shown serious improvement and, in your opinion, deserve not to fail. In this case, instead of the normal percentage designations for letter grades (90% for A, 80% for B, etc. down to 50-0% being an F), you define a lower limit for failing grades - a minimum score that is higher than zero. This makes it so that particularly low-scoring assignments have a less drastic effect when averaged with a student's good scores. In other words, a few bad scores are less likely to drag a student's overall grade down.\n\n\nFor example, let's say that a student completely bombs his first test, scoring a 0. However, since then, he's studied hard, receiving 70% and 80% on his next two tests. Un-curved, he has a 50% grade right now - a failing score. If we set a lower limit on failing scores of 40%, his new average is 63.3% - a D. It's not a great score, but it's probably more fair than failing a student who's shown real promise.\nYou may choose to set separate lower limits for assignments that are turned in vs. assignments that are not. For example, you may decide that, for failing assignments, the lowest possible grade is a 40%, unless it's not turned in at all, in which case 30% is the lowest possible score.",
                "Use a bell curve. Often, the range of grades on a given assignment are distributed in a way that resembles a bell curve - a few students get high scores, most of the students score mid-range scores, and a few students get low scores. What if, for instance, on a particularly difficult assignment, the few high scores are in the 80% range, the mid-range scores are in the 60% range, and the low scores are in the 40% range? Do the very best students in your class deserve low B's and the average students deserve low D's? Probably not. By using a bell curve grading method, you set the class's mean grade as a middle C, which means that your best students should get A's and your worst students should get F's, regardless of their absolute scores.\n\n\nBegin by determining the class's mean (average) score. Add up all the scores in the class, then divide by the number of students to find the mean. Let's say that, after doing this, we find an average score of 66%.\nSet this as a mid-range grade. The precise grade you use is at your discretion - you may want to set the mean as a C, C+, or even B-, for instance. Let's say that we want to set our 66% as a nice, round C.\nNext, decide how many points separate the letter grades in your new bell curve. Generally, bigger point intervals mean that your bell curve is more forgiving to low-scoring students. Let's say that in our bell curve, we want to separate our grades by 12 points. This means that 66 + 12 = 78 becomes our new B, while 66 - 12 = 54 becomes our new D, etc.\nAssign grades according to the new bell curve system.",
                "Apply a linear scale grading curve. When you have a very specific idea of the grade distribution you want, but the actual grades in your class don't fit, you may want to use a linear scale curve. This curve allows you to adjust the distribution of grades so to get the mean score exactly where you want it. However, it's also somewhat math intensive and it technically uses a different grading curve for each student, which some may perceive to be unfair.\n\n\nFirst, choose 2 raw scores (actual student scores) and determine what you want them to be after the curve. For instance, let's say the actual mean score on an assignment is 70% and you want it to be 75%, while the actual lowest score is 40% and you want it to be 50%.\n\nNext, create 2 x/y points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Each x value will be one of the raw scores you chose, while each y value will be the corresponding score that you want the raw score to be. In our case, our points are (70, 75) and (40, 50).\n\nPlug your values into the following equation: f(x) = y1 + ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) (x-x1). Note the lone \"x\" without any subscripts - for this, plug in the score of each individual assignment. The final value you get for f(x) is the assignment's new grade. To clarify - you have to do the equation once for each student's score.\nIn our case, let's say we're curving an assignment that got an 80%. We would solve the equation as follows:\n\nf(x) = 75 + (((50 - 75)/(40-70))(80-70))\nf(x) = 75 + (((-25)/(-30))(10))\nf(x) = 75 + .83 (10)\nf(x) = 83.3 . The 80% score on this assignment is now 83.3%.",
                "Offer re-do opportunities. If you're not interested in applying a complicated formula to your students' grades, but you still want to offer them a chance to improve their score on a certain assignment, consider offering students an opportunity to re-do sections of an assignment they did poorly on. Give the assignment back to students and allow them to re-do problems they missed. Then, grade the problems they re-did. Offer the students some percentage of the points they earned on their re-do attempt, and add these to their first score to get their final grades.\n\n\nLet's say that a student scored 60 points out of 100 on a test. We give the test back to the student, offering half-credit for any problems she re-does. She re-works the problems she missed, scoring 30 more points. We then give her 30/2 = 15 more points, making her final score 60 + 15 = 75 points.\n\nDon't allow students to merely correct the work they've done. Instead, to ensure they fully understand how to do the problems from start to finish, have them completely rewrite the items they missed.",
                "Remove an item from the assignment and regrade. Even the best teachers occasionally put unfair or misleading questions on their tests. If, after grading, you find that there are one or two particular items that most of the students seemed to struggle on, you may want to disregard these questions and grade the assignment as if they weren't included. This is an especially good idea if a certain question used concepts that you haven't taught your students yet or if it falls outside the reasonable expectations for student performance. In these cases, re-grade assignments as if the problematic sections don't exist.\n\n\nNote, however, that this method gives extra weight to the questions you do choose to include. It may also anger students who did well on the questions you chose to eliminate - you may want to offer them some form of extra credit.",
                "Assign extra credit problems. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book. After an assignment that went poorly for some (or all) of your students, offer your students a special problem, project or task that, if completed, will raise their scores. This may be an extra problem that requires creative thinking, an extra assignment, or even a presentation - be creative!\n\n\nHowever, use caution with this method - the students who probably need the most help are also the least-likely to be able to answer super-hard extra credit questions. You may find that your extra credit assignments are more effective if they allow students to incorporate classroom concepts into outside-the-box projects and assignments. For instance, if you're teaching a class on poetry, you may want to offer an extra-credit assignment that requires students to analyze the rhyme scheme of their favorite pop song."

        "How to Help Paranoid People": {
            "intro": "Helping someone with paranoia can be difficult. Paranoid people don’t see the world the way most others do, and it’s all too easy to alienate them or make them feel suspicious of you. Sensitivity and understanding are the keys to helping a paranoid person get the treatment they need without making them feel like you’re judging them negatively. One of the best ways you can help a paranoid person is to reassure them when they are struggling with delusional thoughts. You can also help them develop long-term coping strategies and encourage them to seek professional help.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid arguing with the person. When your friend or family member expresses delusional thoughts, listen to them, but don’t argue. The delusion seems completely real to them, so you won’t be able to talk them into believing something else.[1]\n\nArguing can even make the situation worse, since it will make the person feel like no one understands them.",
                "Avoid affirming the person’s paranoia. Focus on understanding how the person is feeling. Show empathy for their emotions, but don’t say anything that will reinforce their delusion.[2]\n\nFor instance, if your friend tells you that kidnappers are following her, don’t play along. Instead, say something like, “That sounds really scary, but I’ll make sure you’re safe.”\nWithout trying to change the person’s mind, let them know that you aren’t perceiving what they are. For instance, say, “No, I didn’t see any people following us.”",
                "Ask questions. See if you can get the person to tell you more about their fears. This can help you figure out where the delusion is coming from and give you a better idea of how to reassure the person. The person may also feel better after talking to you.[3]\n\nAsk an open-ended question like, “Why do you think the kidnappers are following you?” or “Do you want to tell me more?”",
                "Help the person feel safer and more comfortable. If something in the environment is frightening them, take the person somewhere else. Offer them some food or water. Reassure them that you are not afraid, and tell them you’ll make sure nothing bad happens to them.[4]\n\nFor instance, if you’re in a building with a family member who thinks someone is sending them messages over the PA system, take them outside.\nIf the person takes medication, ask them when they last took a dose. If it was longer ago than the bottle instructs, make sure they take a dose as soon as possible.",
                "Help the person maintain a positive state of mind. When you’re around your friend or family member, model positive thinking and optimism for them. Offer to help them come up with some mantras or affirmations to use when they start to feel paranoid.[5]\n\nFor instance, the person might find it helpful to repeat something like, “Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to think about me,” or “Even though I feel scared, I’m not really in danger.”\nEncourage the person to write down the mantra and keep it with them so they can read it when they need it.",
                "Help the person put their paranoid thoughts into perspective. Invite the person to share their thoughts with you or someone else they trust if they need a reality check. Encourage them to give people the benefit of the doubt if they aren’t sure about someone’s intentions towards them.[6]\n\nThis strategy works best for people with mild paranoia who can accept that their judgment is sometimes unsound. Severely paranoid people may not be willing to ask for other people’s perspectives.",
                "Encourage the person to adopt balanced habits. A healthy lifestyle can make mental health issues easier to manage. Help your friend or family member find ways to cut down on stress, get enough rest, and maintain good diet and exercise habits.[7]\n\nFor example, including physical activity as a part of their daily routine can help improve their mood and boost cognitive functioning that may be impaired with paranoia.",
                "Encourage the person to contribute in areas of life where they excel. Many people with paranoia-related issues have unique talents or a successful career. Recognize the areas where your friend or family member shines, and encourage them to keep doing things they enjoy and are good at.[8]\n\nLet's say your friend is really creative. You might encourage them to submit their artwork to a local art contest to keep them occupied and focus on positive activities.",
                "Prepare for crisis situations. If your friend or family member has an illness like schizophrenia, help them come up with an emergency plan when they’re stable. Gather important contact information like their doctor’s phone number, and discuss who will take care of any children or pets they have if they are hospitalized.[9]\n\nHave the person keep this information with them at all times, such as written on a card or on a piece of paper.",
                "Distinguish between paranoia and anxiety. Paranoia can look similar to anxiety on the surface, but these issues are actually very different. Paranoia involves delusional thoughts, while anxiety does not. The two disorders require different treatments, so it’s important not to mix them up.[10]\n\nFor instance, an anxious person might worry that they have a disease, while a paranoid person might be convinced that their doctor purposely gave them a disease.\nAnxiety is much more common than paranoia. Someone who is anxious will appear to be more alert in case of danger, but someone who is paranoid will appear to expect danger at any moment.",
                "Avoid trying to diagnose or treat the paranoid person yourself. If your friend or family member doesn’t have a diagnosis yet, it’s important that they get one from a professional. Self-diagnoses are often inaccurate, and the person could seek the wrong kind of treatment as a result.[11]",
                "Encourage the person to see doctor or psychotherapist. Your friend or family member may need medication, psychotherapy, or both to manage their paranoia. Urge them to talk to their doctor about their treatment options. If they have trouble making it to their appointments, offer to help by giving them a ride or watching their kids.[12]\n\nConvincing a paranoid person to see a doctor can be a challenge. They may not trust medical professionals. If the person doesn’t want to seek treatment, don’t push them too hard, or they may become suspicious of you, too.\nIf your friend is resistant, you might say, \"I know you don't think anything is wrong, but it would really give me peace of mind if you saw a doctor. Will you just go to make me feel better. If everything checks out, I'll stop bugging you.\" This will make the request about you rather than them and that might make it easier for them to accept.",
                "Call 911 if you think anyone is in danger. If your friend or family member starts having bizarre delusions, or if they threaten to hurt themselves or others, they need medical attention right away. Don’t wait and see if they get better on their own – call 911, or the emergency services department. The hospital is the safest place for them until they are stable again.[13]\n\nA non-bizarre delusion is something that could plausibly happen in reality. A bizarre delusion, on the other hand, couldn’t happen in the real world.\nFor instance, if someone believed that aliens had given them the ability to fly, they would be having a bizarre delusion."

        "wikiHow to Dry Apples": {
            "intro": "Maybe your apple tree was overzealous in production, or maybe you bought too many apples thinking you wanted eight apple pies — whatever the reason, you now have a lot of extra apples on your hands. Why not try drying them out? Dried apples are delicious, healthy snacks that can be stored for months. Follow these easy steps to dry your apples.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash your apples. You do not necessarily need to peel them. The skin adds extra flavor to the apples and also contain a good deal of the fiber apples are famous for. Other people like to peel their apples because they do not like the texture of the dried skins. It is really just a matter of what you like.\n\n\nAny variety of apple can be dried, though Gala, Fuji, and Golden Delicious work particularly well.",
                "Cut away the cores. You will also want to cut out any worm-eaten parts. Kitchen stores sell apple corers that will easily and efficiently remove your apple cores. However, if you do not have one of these devices you can also core your apples by hand.[1]\n\nIf you are using these apples for decorations, or you really like your food to look as beautiful as possible, skip the coring. Apples that are not cored and are cut so that they keep their circular shape have a pretty star pattern in the center created by the core.",
                "Cut the apples into thin slices. You can either cut your apples so that they retain their circular shape, or you can cut them into thin wedges. Again, this is simply based on your own preference, though some say that the thinner the slices, the easier it is to dry the apples.",
                "Dip your slices into a solution that will keep them from browning. An excellent solution for this is lemon juice, pineapple juice and water mixed together. The pineapple juice isn’t necessary but it adds sweetness to the mixture that counteracts the sour flavor of the lemon juice.[2] Pre-treating the apples will also help them retain more of their vitamin A and vitamin C properties as well as provide a better texture in the final product. Here are some methods you can use to pretreat the apples:\n\n\nSoak the apple slices in lemon juice. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.\nSoak the apple slices in sodium bisulfite. Mix 2 teaspoons (9.85 mL) of sodium bisulfite into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.\nSoak the apple slices in ascorbic acid for a result 6 times more effective than lemon juice. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.78 mL) of crystalline ascorbic acid into 1 quart (2 pints) of cold water. Soak the fruit for 3 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.\nYou can also add orange juice and lemon juice mixed with water.",
                "Sprinkle seasonings on the slices (optional). Some people like to flavor their apple slices with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice. These give the apple slices a flavor boost, but unflavored apple slices are equally delicious.[3]",
                "Set your oven to 200ºF (93.3ºC.) You can even make your oven go down a bit lower, to 145ºF (62.7ºC), but many ovens will not go down this low.[4]",
                "Place the apple slices on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Make sure that they are not overlapping or else they will fuse together while they are drying.",
                "Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the apples for at least an hour on each side. Bake the apple slices for an hour. When the hour has passed, remove the sheets and flip all of the apple slices over. Bake the apples for one more hour is you prefer your apples to be a little less crispy. If you like crispy dried apples, bake them for two more hours. Just make sure to bake them evenly on each side.\n\n\nYou should keep an eye on your apples and check them periodically. All ovens are different and your oven might take a longer or shorter amount of time to dry the apples.",
                "Turn the oven off but do not take the apples out for another one to two hours. Inside, crack the oven door open a small amount and let the apples cool inside the oven. You should not take the apples out until the oven has cooled completely (this should take one or two hours).[5].\n\n\nThere's another school of thought that you should keep your oven open during the entire cooking process, with a fan blowing on it to help circulate the air. If you decide to prop the oven open in advance, just cook the apples for 6-10 hours.",
                "Spread the apple slices on some shallow cooking trays. Cover the bottom of the trays with parchment paper or some other cooking paper before placing the apples on the trays. Cooking trays that have lips are better than cookie trays because the drying apples may leak a little juice which could make a sticky mess.",
                "Place the apples in the sun on a warm (or hot) day. Keep them out as long as the sun is out. Cover the apples loosely with cheesecloth to protect the fruit from any pesky bugs. In the evening, before the dew falls, bring the apple slices indoors so that they do not get moldy. Place the tray in a dry spot in your house.[6]",
                "Turn the apple slices. At least once a day, turn the apple slices over so that the underside faces the sun. This will result in an even drying. You should also turn them when you bring them in for the night.[7]",
                "Place the apples in the sun again. The next day, spread the apple slices in the sun again and keep them out all day once more. They will probably become quite dry during the course of the day. Normally this method takes about two days to be fully completed.",
                "Hang the dry apple slices. When the apples are quite dry, which is when the outside flesh is not moist at all, put them into brown paper bags and hang them up in an airy, dry place; alternatively put them in plastic airtight containers for storage.",
                "Arrange the slices on the drying rack of the dehydrator. Try to spread them out so that none of the pieces are touching each other. If they do touch, they might fuse together while they are in the dehydrator.",
                "Turn the dehydrator on. If your dehydrator has a temperature control, set it to 140ºF (60ºC). Using the dehydrator will take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours depending on the type of apple and how thickly you cut the slices.[8]",
                "Take them out when they are done. You can tell when a dried apple is done by feeling it. The slices should feel bendable or leathery and not brittle. Some people liken them to the consistency of a fresh raisin. Store the apples in airtight containers until you are ready to sit back and enjoy them."

        "How to Treat a Sinus Infection for a Toddler": {
            "intro": "Sinus infections are often secondary infections that occur after a common cold or after a respiratory allergy. It is important that you learn to identify and treat the symptoms of a sinus infection in order to prevent the spread of illness and complications of untreated sinus infection.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Recognize the symptoms of a sinus infection. Sinus infections in children are characterized by persistent cold-like symptoms. Sinusitis can be caused by a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.\n\n\nCold-like symptoms of sinus infections include persistent sneezing, coughing, and congestion that lasts for two weeks or more. In addition, your toddler may have green nasal discharge and sore throat.[2]\n\nYour child may also complain of facial pain or headache that is linked to congestion and present with puffy eyes.[3]\n\nSinus infections often cause fevers in young children of 102°F (39°C) or higher.[4]\n\nChronic sinus infections consist of symptoms that last three months or longer with several episodes within a year. [5]",
                "Give your toddler acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help relieve pain and fever. You can use over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications to help manage your child’s facial pain, headache, and fever associated with sinus infection.\n\n\nMake sure that you are only giving your toddler the dose that is appropriate for her age and weight. Check with a nurse or your toddler’s pediatrician if you are not sure what kind of dose to give to your child.\nA fever that is under 101°F (38°C) in a toddler is considered low-grade and can be treated with medication.\nKeep your eye on your child if her fever is between 101°F (38°C) and 103°F (39.4°C); if it does not go down after a few hours of treating your child with OTC medication or lasts longer than three days, call your pediatrician.[6]\n\nA fever that is 104°F (40°C) or higher and does not come down within a couple of hours after giving your toddler medication requires immediate medical attention.[7]\n\nOTC medications that can be used to treat your child’s fever include ibuprofen (e.g., Advil) for children six months and older and acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) for infants two months and older.\nDo not treat your toddler’s fever with aspirin. Aspirin should not be given to children under the age of 18 because it can cause a rare but potentially fatal disease called Reye's syndrome.[8]",
                "Keep your child well hydrated. Keeping your toddler hydrated helps to alleviate many of his sinus infection symptoms, including congestion, vomiting, and fever. There are a variety of ways to keep your child hydrated.[9]\n\nGive your child cool beverages to stay hydrated. Pedialyte and Gatorade may be extra helpful by providing a boost of electrolytes.\nIf your child has a sore throat, a popsicle may help to ease the pain while also providing fluids.[10]\n\nOlder toddlers may also be served warm or cold caffeine-free herbal tea with honey to ease a sore throat.[11]\n\nPlease note that honey should not be given to a child under one year of age due to the risk of botulism.[12]\n\nYou can also give your sick toddler chicken soup, which is a good source of fluids and nutrients.",
                "Give your toddler a bath. Giving your toddler a bath allows can help relieve some of the symptoms of sinusitis. The steam from a warm bath can help ease congestion and loosen mucus.\n\n\nTaking a lukewarm bath may also help to reduce your toddler’s fever. Make sure that the water is not hotter than 90°F (32.3°C) or too cold.[13]\n\nYour toddler may also benefit from having a warm, moist towel over her face to help reduce facial pain and open up the sinuses.[14]",
                "Use saline nose drops. Much of your child’s discomfort comes from his packed sinuses and nasal passages. You can help release mucus by using saline nose drops and suction.\n\n\nUse salt water nose drops to help thin mucus in your child’s sinuses. Put drops into his nostrils according to the directions on the packaging.[15]\n\nUse a bulb syringe to suction off the mucus.",
                "Run a cool mist humidifier in your child's room. Extra moisture in the air helps to thin the mucus in your child’s sinuses and nasal passages. Running a cool mist humidifier overnight can help relieve pressure and ensure a better sleep.[16]\n\nMake sure you keep the humidifier clean and dry to keep mold and bacteria from spreading through the air.",
                "Ensure your child gets plenty of rest. As with any illness, your child needs plenty of rest in order to fight off a sinus infection. Make sure that your child has a comfortable place to sleep and that he rests during the day.\n\n\nIf your child is restless, give him quiet entertainment such as an interactive video or low-energy toys to play with.[17]\n\nKeep your child out of daycare so that he does not spread the infection.",
                "Do not use over-the-counter decongestants and antihistamines. Avoid giving your toddler OTC decongestants and antihistamine medications if she is under the age of four. Generally, these medications are not effective at treating sinus infections in young toddlers and are easy to overdose.\n\n\nOTC decongestants and antihistamine medications, such as Claritin and Benadryl, are not effective at treating upper respiratory infections, especially those caused by bacteria.[18]\n\nTalk to your doctor before giving any OTC medication to give your child. Your child's doctor can advise on allergy medications if your child has allergies along with a sinus infection.",
                "Take your toddler to the pediatrician. If your toddler is not feeling better after a few days or his condition worsens, seek medical attention. Your child’s pediatrician can diagnose the cause of sinusitis and prescribe medication if needed.\n\n\nThe pediatrician may perform an examination to see if your child has sinusitis, such as looking in the nasal cavity for polyps, shining a light through a sinus to look for signs of inflammation, or performing a nasal culture.[19] She will also check your child's ears, throat and lungs.",
                "Ask if your child has an acute or chronic sinusitis. Your child may suffer from acute or chronic sinusitis, depending on the severity and duration of his infection. The doctor can help make the distinction and treat it accordingly.[20]\n\nChronic sinusitis tends to last 12 or more weeks or causes recurring infections four to six times in one year.\nAcute sinusitis typically lasts only a few weeks and the symptoms tend to be more severe within that short span of time.[21]",
                "Ask the pediatrician whether your child needs antibiotics. Your toddler may require antibiotics in order to treat her sinusitis. Antibiotics are can be used to treat bacterial sinus infections but are not effective on viral infections.[22]\n\nThe pediatrician is likely to prescribe antibiotics after your child has been ill for longer than 10 days, as this is a sign of a bacterial infection versus a viral infection.[23]\n\nIf your child is prescribed a course of antibiotics, the medication should be taken as directed by your child’s doctor and no doses should be skipped even when your child begins to feel better.[24]",
                "Consider allergy tests or treatment for your child. If your child has symptoms suggestive of allergies or known allergic triggers, then allergy testing or treatment may be in order. Children with allergies are more likely to have problems with sinus infections.",
                "Ask your doctor if your toddler needs surgery for chronic sinusitis. In extreme causes of recurrent or chronic sinusitis, the best course of action may be surgery. Your pediatrician can advise you about whether this is right for your toddler.\n\n\nSurgery is considered as the best option when your child has multiple episodes of sinusitis that cannot be relieved with medication therapy.[25]\n\nA surgery generally consists of removing some of the tissue near the sinuses in order to allow mucus to move more freely.[26]",
                "Learn what causes sinusitis in toddlers. Understanding the mechanism behind sinusitis can help you gain a better appreciation of how to treat its symptoms. You may also be able to keep your toddler from contracting it.\n\n\nAcute sinusitis is typically caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that causes the sinuses to swell up, leaving mucus trapped and increasing pressure in the sinuses.[27]\n\nChronic sinusitis may be caused either by a severe infection or by structural abnormalities in the sinuses such as polyps or bone spurs, or abnormalities of the cilia that keep them from ushering mucus out of the sinuses.[28]\n\nAllergic rhinitis is another risk factor for chronic or recurring sinus infections.",
                "Know the risk factors for sinusitis. Reduce your child’s risk of contracting sinusitis by educating yourself about the risk factors. You can take control of your child’s environment to help decrease her likelihood of suffering from a sinus infection.\n\n\nIf your child is immunosuppressed, she is more likely to contract an infection. To support a healthy immune system, give your toddler a nutritious diet and plenty of rest.[29]\n\nTeach your toddler how to reduce risk of illness by following a proper hygiene at daycare or school. For example, ask for your toddler to wash her hands before eating a snack and after using the restroom.[30]\n\nKeep your child’s respiratory tract healthy by keeping her away of smoky environments.[31]\n\nNever take your toddler to school or daycare when she is sick in order to prevent the spread of illness.",
                "Learn how to prevent sinusitis. Armed with an understanding of what causes sinusitis, you can take steps to prevent it. Making small changes can improve your child’s health.\n\n\nWhen the air is dry in your home, especially if you are running the heater, use a humidifier to help your child breathe easy.[32]\n\nTake care of your child’s cold and flu symptoms early before the illness turns into a sinus infection. This can include preventative measures such as getting a flu shot and other routine childhood immunizations.[33]\n\nMake sure that your child washes his hands thoroughly and often, especially when playing with other children, in order to decrease his risk of contracting an infection.[34]"

Being short or snapping at another co-worker is a terrible way to start a relationship.\n\n\nMake sure to either bring or ask for a notebook to begin taking notes early in the day. Bringing one from home shows initiative. Don't be the new employee who doesn't write anything down.",
                "Arrive early and ready to work.[2] Plan to be there at least 15 minutes early. Report directly to your boss or human resources contact.\n\n\nIf you don't know where to go, kindly let another employee know this is your first day and ask them for directions. They had a first day too so they will understand.",
                "Turn your cell phone off.[3][4] Until you know the rules, assume that using your cell phone during business hours is grounds for immediate termination (this assumption is not far from reality). The first day is all about first impressions. Any cell phone interruption signals a lack of professionalism.",
                "Prepare to be civil and cordial.[5]Most of the bad workplace behaviors come from a lack of respect for others. While your co-workers function in a variety of roles at work, they are still people with feelings. Being nice and leaving hand written Thank You's[6] builds positive working relationships.\n\n\nPrepare to avoid joking or discussing race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or religion. These are sensitive issues for most people. Even if you are comfortable discussing these topics, many other people may feel uncomfortable if you discuss them openly.\nResist the temptation to ask or pry into people's personal lives. If your curiosity is tickled, ask yourself if the answer is work-related? If not, its best to not ask.\nDrive carefully in the parking lot and don't be rude to others as you are rushing to clock in or out on time. Even if you are not on the clock, the people you are speeding past and bumping into are still your co-workers.",
                "Introduce yourself to others with a smile. Smile and take time to introduce yourself in the elevator or to colleagues at the desks across from yours. This small step will help you start developing a relationship with co-workers and let them know you're part of the team.\n\n\nAs you introduce yourself to others, make an effort to remember their names and positions. Write names and positions in your notebook to memorize. If necessary, note memorable physical features or personal characteristics to help you match faces with names. Quickly learning names shows others you value them.[7]",
                "Ask questions as they arise.[8] You will not know how to do everything nor will you understand the processes on the first day. When you run into a problem, ask someone promptly. The first day it is better to ask and verify than to do something wrong. Since it is your first day, you have a license to ask too many questions. Remember to write down the response in your notebook for future reference.\n\n\nIf someone is going through a procedure too fast for you to write, ask them to slow down. This may seem rude, but they will appreciate it it. If you write everything down properly, they won't have to repeat themselves later.\nWhen you've finished a set of instructions, repeat the process back to your instructor. This gives them a chance to ensure you have documented the process properly. They may also emphasize certain points you will want to highlight.",

There may be critical and clear reasons why their methods are different.\n\n\nISO-9001 and other standards have strict rules you may not anticipate. Using a pencil, white-out, or a colored ink pen could land you in hot water with your boss. Even benign changes to procedures can negatively impact your performance.\nIf you are given a computer, do not attempt to view webpages or download files without permission. This includes checking your personal email or downloading backgrounds. This may seem benign but may cause you to get in trouble with the computer services department.",
                "Review and expand your notes continuously. After the first day you are expected to remember what you've been repeatedly told. Anytime you have an issue, review your notebook first. Asking for directions only if necessary. This helps show you are capable of working independently. The sooner you can show this, the more respect you will earn from your co-workers.",
                "Demonstrate consistently appropriate work behavior. Continue to show up to work early, dressed appropriate, and ready to work. The first month people develop clear expectations about you. This will influence how they treat you as a co-worker.\n\n\nIf you are late or make a business dress faux pas, take responsibility for your mistake. Traffic may have been bad, but you could have accounted for it. Making excuses for your temporary lack of etiquette show immaturity.",
                "Read all employment information. Anything your boss or human resources department hands you to read over, do so promptly. Ask questions where you do not understand. Make notes of any rules you think will be difficult to remember or that you think you might break accidentally.\n\n\nFor example, at most jobs, discussing pay is considered \"unethical\" and may be grounds for termination. Discussing politics and religion may also get you in trouble even if you do so off-the-clock.",
                "Complete any forms promptly. Many forms must be completed within the first week or month of employment. These include tax and health insurance enrollment forms such as a W-2. You may need to ask your human resources contact how to appropriately fill out these forms.",
                "Memorize people's names and relationships.[9] Beyond just your boss and co-workers, you need to learn the names and relationships of people throughout the company. People who you will meet face-to-face and department heads are particularly important.\n\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed learning people's names and positions, trying drawing a diagram of each department with the department head at the top and everyone under them below. As you learn people's positions, you can write them down and orient them vertically according to their role.",
                "Stay confident and relax.[10] It's a new job and there's a lot to learn, but don't let it intimidate you. Remember you earned that job due to your experience and let your workplace attitude display that confidence and experience. If you get frustrated or overwhelmed, take a deep breath and try again. Let your new bosses see that you work well in new situations and under pressure.\n\n\nNo matter how many notes you write you will still mess up. When corrected, say \"thank you\" and look over your notes for errors. Do not blame another co-worker even if you believe their instructions were incomplete. Review your updated instructions with the person correcting you.",
                "Accept lunch invitations if offered. [11] Even if you brought your lunch, your lunch break is more than food. Its about being social with co-workers and bosses. Being invited to lunch signals interest. This gives you an opportunity to develop a deeper, better relationship with this person.",
                "Stay in business mode.[12] Whether you are at lunch with a co-worker or at home posting on social media you shouldn't relax too much. Whenever work is involved, stay in a professional mindset. Subtle or abrupt changes to your level of professional courtesy may be construed as a lack of respect.",
                "Work as a team player. You're a new employee, but you're part of a team. Ask questions and accept criticism with a smile.\n\n\nWhen you've completed your assigned tasks, ask your manager or superior what you can be doing to help the team. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you're asked to participate in a team or group function. Co-workers will be more likely to help you out and answer your questions if you establish yourself as a team player.\nEngage your new co-workers in conversation when they welcome you to the team, but stay neutral in your opinions about them. You're just as likely to get welcomed into the office fantasy football pool as you are to get targeted by the office gossip, so remain objective until you know whose welcome is genuine.\nDo not be quick to complain about your work even if asked what you do not like about the job so far. Focus on how you can improve your own job performance.[13]"

            "intro": "Having a positive outlook is a choice. You can choose to think thoughts that elevate your mood, throw a more constructive light on difficult situations, and generally color your day with brighter, more hopeful approaches to the things you do. By choosing to take a positive outlook on life, you can begin to shift out of a negative frame of mind and see life as filled with possibilities and solutions instead of worries and obstacles. If you want to know how to think more positively, just follow these tips.",
            "steps": [
                "Take responsibility for your attitude. You are solely responsible for your thoughts, and your outlook on life is a choice.[1] If you tend to think negatively, you are choosing to think that way. With practice, you can choose to have a more positive outlook.[2]",
                "Understand the benefits of being a positive thinker. Choosing to think more positively will not only help you take control of your life and make your everyday experiences more pleasant, but it can also benefit your mental and physical health as well as your ability to deal with change. Being aware of these benefits can help you be even more motivated to think positively on a regular basis.[3]Here are some benefits of positive thinking:\n\n\nAn increased life span\nLower rates of depression and distress\nGreater resistance to the common cold\nBetter mental and physical well-being\nBetter coping skills during times of stress\nA more natural ability to form relationships and cement bonds",
                "Keep a diary to reflect your thoughts. Recording your thoughts can enable you to step back and evaluate patterns in your thinking. Write down your thoughts and feelings and try to spot any triggers that lead to either positive or negative thoughts. Taking just twenty minutes to follow your pattern of thinking at the end of every day can be a valuable way to identify your negative thoughts and make a plan to change them to positive thoughts.\n\n\nYour journal can take on any form that you like. If you don’t care to write long-winded reflective paragraphs, you can just make a list of the five most prevalent negative thoughts and positive thoughts you had that day.\nBe sure to give yourself the time and opportunity to evaluate and reflect on the information in the journal. If you write every day, you may want to reflect at the end of every week.",
                "Identify your automatic negative thoughts. In order to shift away from the negative thinking that is holding you back from having a positive outlook, you'll need to become more aware of your \"automatic negative thoughts\". When you recognize them, you're in a position to challenge them and give them their marching orders to move right out of your head.[4][5]\n\nAn example of an automatic negative thought is, upon hearing that you have an upcoming test, you think, “I’ll probably fail it.” The thought is automatic because it’s your initial reaction to hearing about the test.",
                "Challenge your negative thoughts. Even if you have spent most of your life thinking negatively, you don’t have to continue being negative. Whenever you have a negative thought, particularly an automatic negative thought, stop and evaluate[6] whether the thought is true or accurate.[7]\n\nOne way to challenge negative thoughts is to be objective. Write down the negative thought and think about how you would respond if someone else said the thought to you. It’s likely that you could offer an objective rebuttal to someone else’s negativity, even if you find it difficult to do for yourself.[8]\n\nFor example, you may have the negative thought, “I always fail tests.” It is unlikely that you would still be in school if you always fail tests. Go back through your files or grades and find tests that you received a passing grade on; these challenge the negative thought. You may even find that you have tests that you passed with As and Bs, which would further confirm that your negativity is exaggerated.",
                "Replace the negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Once you're feeling confident that you can spot and challenge negative thoughts, you're ready to make active choices about replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.[9] This doesn't mean that everything in your life will always be positive; it’s normal to have a variety of emotions. However, you can work to replacing the daily unhelpful thinking patterns with thoughts that help you to flourish.\n\n\nFor example, if you have the thought, “I will probably fail the test,” stop yourself. You’ve already identified the thought as negative and evaluated its accuracy. Now try replacing it with a positive thought. A positive thought doesn’t have to be blindly optimistic, such as “I will definitely get a 100 on the test, even if I don’t study.” It can be something as simple as, “I am going to take time to study and prepare so I do as well on the test as I can.”\nUse the power of questions. When you ask your brain a question, it tends to find the answer for you. If you ask yourself, \"Why is life so terrible?\" your brain will try to answer your question. The same is true if you ask yourself, \"How did I get to be so lucky?\". Ask yourself questions which draw your focus onto positive thoughts.",
                "Minimize external influences that stimulate your negativity. You may find that certain kinds of music or violent video games or movies influence your overall attitude.[10] Try minimizing your exposure to stressful or violent stimuli and spend more time listening to calming music or reading. Music benefits your mind really well and books on positive thinking can provide good tips for being a happier person.",
                "Avoid \"black-and-white thinking.\" In this type of thinking, also known as “polarizing,” everything you encounter either is or it isn't; there are no shades of gray. This can lead people to feel as though they have to do something perfectly or not at all.[11]\n\nTo avoid this type of thinking, embrace the shades of gray in life. Instead of thinking in terms of two outcomes (one positive and one negative), make a list of all of the outcomes in between to see that things aren't as dire as they seem.\nFor example, if you have a test coming up and don’t feel comfortable with the subject matter, you may be tempted to not take the test or to not study for it at all, so if you fail, it’s because you didn’t even try. However, this is ignoring the fact that you’re likely to do better if you spend more time preparing for the test.\n\nYou should also avoid thinking that the only outcomes of your test-taking are an A or an F. There is a lot of “gray area” between the A and the F.",
                "Avoid \"personalizing\". Personalizing is making the assumption that you are personally to blame for anything that goes wrong. If you take this type of thinking too far, you can get paranoid and think that no one likes you or wants to hang out with you, and that every little move you make is going to disappoint someone.[12]\n\nSomeone who is personalizing may think, \"Betty didn't smile at me this morning. I must have done something to upset her.\" However, it's more likely that Betty was just having a bad day, and her mood had nothing to do with you.",
                "Avoid \"filter thinking.\" This is when you choose to only hear the negative side of a situation. Most situations have elements that are both good and bad, and it helps to recognize both. If you think this way, then you'll never see the positive in any situation.[13]\n\nFor example, you may take a test and receive a C, along with feedback from your teacher saying that your performance improved greatly from the last test. Filtering can cause you to only think negatively about the C and ignore the fact that you have shown improvement and growth.",
                "Avoid \"catastrophizing.\" This is when you assume that the worst possible outcome is going to happen.[14] Catastrophizing is usually related to anxiety about performing poorly. You can combat catastrophizing with being realistic about possible outcomes of a situation.\n\n\nFor example, you might think that you’re going to fail an exam you’ve been studying for. A catastrophizer will then extend that insecurity to assume that you’ll then fail the class and have to drop out of college, then end up unemployed and on welfare. If you’re realistic about negative outcomes, you’ll realize that even if you were to fail a test, it’s unlikely that you would necessarily fail the course, and you would not have to drop out of college.",
                "Visit a peaceful place. It can help to have a personal escape when you need to turn your attitude around. Many people find that spending a little time outdoors improves their mood.[15]\n\nIf your workplace has an outdoor area with benches or picnic tables, schedule yourself a little down time to be outside and refresh yourself.\nIf you are unable to physically visit an outdoor peaceful place, try meditating and visiting a pleasant outdoor area with perfect weather in your mind.[16]",
                "Give yourself time to change. Developing a positive outlook is actually the development of a skill. As with any skill, it takes time to master, and it requires dedicated practice and gentle reminders about not falling back into negative thinking.[17]",
                "Be physically positive. If you change your physical or bodily habits, your mind will follow suit. In order to feel happier in general, approach your physicality in a positive way. Practice good posture, standing up straight and keeping your shoulders down and back.[18] A slump will make you feel more negative. Smile more often. Not only will others smile back at you, but the act of smiling may convince your body that it is happier.[19][20]",
                "Practice mindfulness. Being more aware of your actions and your life will make you feel happier. When you simply go through the motions of your life like a robot, you will likely forget to find the joy in everyday things. By being mindful about your surroundings, your choices, and your daily activities, you can gain greater control of your life and your happiness.[21]\n\nConsider taking up meditation as a way to center yourself and learn excellent focus. By meditating every day for 10 to 20 minutes at a time that's convenient for you, you can increase your awareness of self and the present, helping you to corral the stinking thinking with greater consciousness.[22]\n\nTry taking a yoga class. Yoga can also help you become more aware of the world as you get in touch with your breathing.[23]\n\nEven just stopping to take deep breaths and rest your mind for a few moments can make you feel happier.[24]",
                "Explore your creative side. If you haven't had a chance to explore your creative side, now's the time. Taking the time to be artistic and to work with your hands or explore your most original thoughts can do wonders for your power to think outside the box and to therefore think positively.[25] Even if you don't think you're naturally inclined toward creativity, there are a number of ways you can express yourself to become more positive.[26]\n\nTake a class to learn about something you've never done before: consider pottery, painting, mixed-media collage, poetry, or wood working.[27]\n\nTry learning a new craft such as knitting, crocheting, sewing, or needlepoint. Craft stores and online tutorials are great resources for beginners who do not want to take a class.\nDoodle or draw in a sketchbook every day. Try revisiting older drawings and turning them into something new.\nBe a creative writer. Try penning a poem, short story, or even try your hand at a novel. You can even perform your poetry at an open mic night.\nTry role-playing, dressing as your favorite TV or comic book character, or trying out for a part at a community theatre.[28]",
                "Surround yourself with positive people. We are often influenced by the people around us. If you find that people around you tend to be negative, look to surround yourself with more positive people.[29] This will feed your own positivity. If you have a close family member or a significant other who is constantly negative, encourage her to go on a journey towards positivity with you.\n\n\nAvoid people who sap your energy and motivation. If you can't avoid them, or don't want to, learn how not to let them get you down and keep your connection with them brief.[30]\n\nAvoid dating anyone with a negative outlook. If you're already prone to negative thinking, you'll be falling into a trap. If you do wind up in a relationship with someone who struggles to think positively, though, seeking counseling together might be your best option.",
                "Set meaningful goals. Whatever your goal may be, you should keep yourself busy working on it and believe in the cause you've set for yourself. Once you reach the first goal, you will be inspired to continue with the remaining goals, as well as adding new ones to your life. With each goal you achieve, no matter how small, you will gain confidence and your self-esteem will increase, feeding more positivity in your life.[31]\n\nWorking towards achieving your goals—even if you’re just taking small steps—can make you feel happier.[32]",
                "Don't forget to have fun. People who allow themselves regular fun in their lives tend to be happier and more positive because it isn't all drudgery and never-ending monotony. Fun breaks up the hard work and challenges. Remember that fun does not look the same for everyone, so you may need to spend time finding an activity that is fun for you.[33]\n\nAlways make time for laughter. Hang out with friends who make you laugh, go to a comedy club, or watch a funny movie. It'll be hard to think negatively when your funny bone is being tickled."

                "Choose a weapon for defending your base. If you are going to have a war in an outdoor field, use a weapon with bigger amount of range, but if you are going to have a war indoors, use a weapon with normal range. Your choice of weapon and how you use it is vital. For example, using a stampede and keeping it on the whole time will give your base away in quieter areas. Also, the battery will run out halfway through the battle, leaving you with no suitable defense weapon. Suggestions include:\n\n\nPrimary: Vulcan/Havoc\nSecondary: Night Finder/Firestrike\nTertiary: Secret Strike/Jolt",
                "Alternatively, try the following base weapons:\n\n\nPrimary: Stampede\nSecondary: Maverick\nTertiary: Secret Strike.",

                "If you can see the attack coming from a distance, turn your primary gun on. Get ready to fire at the attackers.",
                "If you get surprise attacked and the enemy has the advantage, collect everything you can, definitely the backpack and your primary weapon. Flee the base.\n\n\nAs soon as you are in a secure location, Walkie-Talkie the other squadrons and tell them you have abandoned your base.\nIf you have made a new base, tell your teammates the co-ordinates of the new base.",
                "Attempt to seize the base back. In this case, call for aid from the other squadrons, meeting them at your co-ordinates.",
                "Leaving the backpack, go off in squadrons of convenient numbers. Break the team into the following:\n\n\nRapid-fire gunners: This is the main fighting force. Arm with pistols, walkie-talkies and GPS.\nSnipers: For taking out with convenience shots. Arm with pistols, possibly armed with Walkie-Talkie and GPS.\nPistol armed men: Infiltration and scout operations. Arm with two pistols each, walkie-talkies and GPS, maybe Nerf swords.\nRapid-fire gunners.",
                "Move at a sustainable speed through the woods. Stop every 100 meters (328.1 ft) to listen for movement and rest. Keep your guns primed, and if battery operated, keep them off.",

                "When you are within 10 meters (32.8 ft), turn your gun on. Then strike, shooting as many bullets as possible, making sure not to shoot your teammate. If the target is not hit, he or she will start to move away. Do not follow the enemy; stay and collect your ammo.",
                "When all ammo has been collected, go in the direction your target went in.",
                "If you can see the attack coming from a distance, ready yourself. Make sure you’re fully loaded and primed, then when they cross the 10 meter (32.8 ft) boundary line, fire until you have one magazine left or all of the enemies are down. If the area is secure, stay to collect your bullets. If there are still enemies in the area, clear out as fast as possible.",

                "If you are a sniper, do the following:\n\n\nFind a good sniping position on high ground (for example, a rocky outcrop).\nPrime your gun.\nScan the area.\nLie in ambush for an enemy to come by.",
                "Train your sight/scope on the enemy.",
                "When he or she is within 10 meters (32.8 ft), fire simultaneously. The enemy will then either move away or hide nearby and wait until you move to a different location and sniper you down.",
                "If you are attacked as a sniper:\n\n\nIf you can see the attack coming from a distance, there is no real threat, just sniper the enemy down when they enter your vicinity.\nIf surprise attacked, get out of there! The enemy will have a higher rate of fire than you and have the advantage of speed, mobility, and the element of surprise.",
                "Move silently through the woods at a steady pace. Be careful not to leave behind obvious footprints and drop items.",
                "When an enemy is sighted, follow them from a distance. Make sure you are not seen or heard. The enemy may lead you to his or her base or hideout.",
                "If the enemy is on his or her own, take him or her down by sneaking up on him or her. If he or she is with teammates, walkie-talkie the rapid-fire gunners, using the GPS to give them the co-ordinates of the enemy's base. Input these into your own GPS, along with the co-ordinates of your own base.",
                "If attacked as an infiltrator or scout by other infiltrators:\n\n\nJudge whether or not you can take them down. If attacked by rapid-fire weapons, run! Finally, if you’re attacked by snipers, hide in cover, then regroup and take them down from behind.",
                "Have a sniper to cover your back in case you are under attack by snipers or mg gunners. Use two or more teammates to cover you. Work together and you are more likely to succeed.",
                "Build fear where possible. Much like other projectile-tagged games, many Nerf strategies and actions are decided by the thought of fear. This is why retreating and falling back are common in Nerf offensives. The main things that create the fear are the rate of fire and the amount of ammunition. One of the most important factors in winning a Nerf battle/war is to never let the enemy know how much ammo one has.",
                "Go on the offensive. Break up the group as much as possible, sending a maximum of three people per small route, while the rest of the team holds larger routes defensively. This allows a smaller team to encircle and eliminate a more concentrated force that will most likely collect in the larger routes.\n\n\nIt is best to know the surroundings where one is fighting; this helps players know hiding spaces and areas with physical advantages.\n\nSpots like these include hills, stairs, fences, and balconies.",
                "Defend your base. There are two basic strategies for this:\n\n\nFirst is by using intimidation. This means using heavy fire against then enemy, regardless of accuracy.\n\nThe drawback to this strategy is that you will be using a lot of darts in a short amount of time. This strategy is best used when there is more than one base defender and they are equip with a motorized weapon. These weapons use a motorized system to continue to fire as long as the soldier continues to hold down the trigger, feeding either from a clip or pre-loaded darts. Examples are the barricade, stampede, vulcan, rayven, or the hail-fire, stryfe.\n\n\nThe second strategy is one of anti-intimidation where you don't shoot at all. Let the enemy get comfortable and approach then shoot them at the last moment.\n\nIf you’re facing multiple enemies, use your cover wisely, as it is one of your biggest advantages over your enemy.\nIf they charge all at once, the best way to counter this is either using two pre-pumped magstrikes, or two vulcans.\nIf choosing the magstrike, always have your guns pre-pumped.",
                "Take cover. Though it seems obvious, you should always be taking cover even when no enemy is in sight especially while reloading.",
                "Do not use damaged darts. They will jam your gun. Put all damaged darts in the damaged dart bin to be repaired.",
                "Preserve your shots. Try to make each shot count as you only have a limited number of darts and no guarantee that you will find any soon. If you are pinned down without darts you can be rushed easily.",
                "Have a secondary always ready. Small secondary weapons should always be loaded and ready in case you are rushed without any darts in your primary. Always go into battle with at least two guns.",
                "Trick your enemy into rushing you by having your weapons loaded and ready then yell out that you are out of ammo. If they rush you, thinking you are an easy kill, prove them wrong.",
                "Use code language. Before each battle have a couple of code words you use to send signals to each other that the enemy will not understand.\n\n\nFor example, \"eagle\" could mean everyone strike at once, \"mouse\" could mean you need more ammo, and \"snake\" could mean retreat back to base.\nTry to keep the code words short and few in number since they should change every battle and everyone needs to be able to easily remember them.",
                "Be practical with equipment. Going into battle with 10 guns may look cool, but you will soon find out that you cannot move easily and will get tired soon. Only use guns that you know how to use, that do not jam easily, and that are not too big for you to handle.",
                "Be efficient. This means that you should know your equipment. If the first time your blaster gets jammed and you do not know how to unjam it, then you are in trouble.\n\n\nOnly use guns you are familiar with. The most common kills will be the people who do not know their equipment well.",
                "Provide cover fire. When moving among barricades or obstacles have your fellow soldiers fire upon the enemy to keep them pinned down while you move closer or get into a better position.",
                "Provide cross fire. With this tactic one soldier positions himself at one angle and another soldier positions himself at an opposite angle so that their shots upon the enemy are coming from two opposite angles making it hard for them to return fire or take cover.",
                "Use a \"Blitzkrieg\". In this method, a densely packed team of Nerfers, typically armed with more powerful blasters, such as Rhino-Fires, Vulcans, or Hail-Fires, use heavy firepower to disorient the enemy with short and powerful attacks. They then surround the enemy and may engage in melee battle if necessary.",
                "\"Funnel\" your team. In this tactic, the team is divided into 2 parts offense to 3 parts defense.\n\n\nThe defense holds a line on the largest major routes while the offense attempts to secure minor routes.\nIf the offense is successful, the enemy team will have no choice but to try to overwhelm the defense in the center.\nWhen in position, the defense caves in the enemy still hold the area. This will result in the enemy team falling deeper into the now bowl-shaped defensive line.\nThe offense then emerges behind the enemy team and takes defensive positions pointed towards the collected enemy team.\nIf done correctly, this leaves the enemy team surrounded and without cover. If the plan fails, the entire team can recover quickly by rushing, taking advantage of their already forward position.",
                "Try \"Blading\". This strategy works best on smaller fields where there are less routes to travel. Similar to funneling, blading shares the goal of entrapping the enemy. While not always as effective, it is easier to recover from and requires less communication.\n\n\nYour team cuts in a diagonal line across the field. The most powerful members of the team should be on the edges, with the weakest parts of the line in the middle. This leaves the enemy no choice but to attack the line, often focusing on the middle.\nWhen the enemy is within the bounds of the line, collapse your team on top of them and redistribute your players.\nThis leaves your enemy surrounded an all but one side.\n\nNote that the line described here is not a straight formation, but rather a loose description of the cover positions of your team.",

        "wikiHow to Plant Hibiscus": {
            "intro": "Hibiscus flowers are widely recognizable by their trumpet-like shape and dainty petals. The large blooms can be up to a foot wide and attract butterflies and hummingbirds to a garden. There are about 200 species of hibiscus, which vary in size, color and cold hardiness. Blooms may be white, red, pink, yellow, blue, purple or bi-color. Hibiscus can be used as a specimen shrub or to create a hedge, adding interest along a bare wall, screen an unsightly fence, or to create a tropical atmosphere by a swimming pool.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a type of hibiscus to plant. Hibiscus come in a variety of colors and appearances, but what is more important than choosing the look of a hibiscus plant, is finding one that will thrive in your local environment. There are two general types of hibiscus bushes: tropical and hardy. Tropical hibiscus will grow in areas with warm weather and temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C) year-round. Hardy hibiscus are hybrids that have been developed to grow in cold areas whose temperatures may drop below freezing in the winter.\n\n\nTropical hibiscus have more plentiful blooms, but they die off after only 1-2 days. They are typically in shades of pink, peach, and purple.\nHardy hibiscus hold their blooms for longer than tropical hibiscus, but don’t have as many and are more ‘bushy’. They generally come in hues of red, white, and pink.[1]",
                "Decide how you’re going to grow your hibiscus. As with most flowering plants, there are three general ways you can grow your hibiscus: from seed, from a transplant, or from a cutting. Growing hibiscus from seed can be fun, because you can create an entirely new cultivar by crossing two existing varieties of hibiscus. On the other hand, growing from seed requires the most work, and may not be successful. If you’re looking for ease and immediate results, you should find a pre-existing potted hibiscus to transplant into your garden.\n\n\n\nGrowing from cuttings is the least likely to be successful, as it requires very specific conditions in order to work out. If you’re new to gardening or growing hibiscus, avoid growing from cuttings.\nYou may not have much variety of choice when growing from a pre-existing potted plant, as nurseries typically only carry a few varieties of hibiscus seedlings or transplants.[2]",
                "Know when to plant. As heat-lovers, hibiscus should not be planted until well after the winter season has ended. Wait until outdoor temperatures are consistently between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) before considering planting. If the temperature drops to 55 degrees, the plant will stop growing. If it drops to 45 degrees or colder, the plant will die. This is less true for hardy varieties of hibiscus, but is still an important reminder of the necessity of heat for these plants.\n\n\nCall your local agricultural extension for specific advice on when to plant in your area.[3]",
                "Choose the perfect location. Hibiscus are sun-loving plants, but they can’t handle too much direct sunlight without getting sunburned. Choose a location in your garden that gets 4-6 hours of direct sunlight a day, and ambient sunlight for the rest of the time. Typically this would be on the west or south side of your garden. The hibiscus can be shaded by larger trees if necessary, but will need space to spread out, as they may eventually take up two or three times the space of their original size.\n\n\nSome hibiscus plants have lived over 40 years, meaning that you could be dealing with a very large bush. Make sure you find a permanent location for your hibiscus to start.[4]\n\nTry to find a location that has good drainage; water-pooling will drown out your hibiscus. On the other hand, avoid a location that is primarily sand.\nMake sure to test the soil’s drainage and permeability before planting. To do this, dig a hole, pour a gallon of water in it, if the water doesn't disappear within an hour, then amend the soil to deal with the extra clay in it. If the water drains too quickly when you pour it in, then consider adding come clay.",
                "Amend the soil. Hibiscus have picky soil requirements, so it is worth it to take time to amend the soil prior to planting them. Test the pH of your garden soil; hibiscus prefer acidic soil, so anything above 6.5 on the pH scale will have to be made more acidic. Additionally, you’ll need to supplement the soil with plenty of nutrients and fertilizer. Mix in a garden compost several weeks (or months, if you have the time) prior to planting. You’ll also want to add a fertilizer to the soil mix, that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium.\n\n\nIf the pH of your soil is too basic, add in peat moss to balance it out.\nCommon low-phosphorus/high-potassium fertilizers include a 10-4-12 mixture, or a 9-3-13 mixture.",
                "Dig your holes. Use a shovel or gardening trowel to prepare your holes for planting. Each hole (for a single plant or hibiscus seed) should be as deep as the roots go, and at least twice, if not three times, as wide. The loose soil around the plant will allow for better drainage, and should not be tamped down. Plant each hibiscus plant at least 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) away from each other.\n\n\nIn cold climates, plant the bulbs deeper than you normally would. In warm and soggy climates, plant the bulbs closer to the surface.",
                "Plant your hibiscus. Carefully place each hibiscus plant into its own individual hole, being careful not to damage the root ball. Refill the hole with soil, going only as high as the base of the stem. Covering up the stems with soil could kill the plant over time. Give your hibiscus a heavy watering two to three times in a row immediately after planting to help reduce the risk of transplant shock.",
                "Water your hibiscus on a regular basis. Try to keep your hibiscus plants moist, but not soaking wet. Make sure that the soil your hibiscus are in is damp at all times, as when it dries out, it can cause wilting and heat stroke in the plants. In the winter when the plant is dormant, only water when the soil gets very dried out.\n\n\nMake sure that you wait one to two weeks before you fertilize the plants.",
                "Manage any pests. It may be beneficial to add a layer of mulch to your hibiscus garden, as this will block out weeds and trap in moisture. Pull out any weeds on sight, so that your hibiscus are not forced to compete for space and nutrients. Tropical hibiscus tend to have issues with pest on occasion, more so than hardy varieties. If you notice spotting or decaying leaves, try using an organic insecticide to kill off any disease or bugs that are harming the hibiscus.",
                "Prune the plants. Although pruning sounds counterintuitive, it actually helps to promote new growth and causes more blossoms to appear. There are several methods of pruning, but they all work by cutting branches just above a node (leaf joint) at an angle away from the center of the bush. This will send a signal to the plant to grow more branches at this location, outwards and away from the center of the bush.\n\n\nIf any part of your hibiscus dies, you should do corrective pruning and cut it off. This will remove the unsightly part of the plant, and may even cause it to re-grow from scratch.\nNever cut off more than ⅔ of a single branch at a time, as this can harm the hibiscus more than it helps.[5]",
                "Enjoy the lovely flowers. Hibiscus will produce flowers for many months, although each individual bloom will likely only last a few days. You can leave the flowers on the bush, or cut them and use them in tea or cooking."

            "steps": [
                "Practice speaking slowly to friends and family. To get more comfortable with talking while wearing your retainer, you should start by speaking slowly to those closest to you on a daily basis. The more you practice speaking, the more comfortable you will become with talking with a retainer. You should be able to talk with relative ease within one month to two months of getting your retainer.[1]\n\nYour tongue will eventually adapt to the retainer. If you practice a lot, using all types of words, you will eventually be able to speak normally.\nAs you start practicing saying words while wearing your retainer, you may notice that you spit or drool when you speak. This is normal, as your mouth will be more full of saliva than normal due to the retainer.[2] You can use a cloth to catch any saliva around your mouth or chin when you are first getting used to wearing and talking with your retainer.\nThe reason you may produce more spit with a retainer is because your mouth perceives it as a foreign object. Your mouth reacts to this foreign object the same way it reacts to a piece of food in your mouth — it increases the flow of saliva.",
                "Read out loud five or more minutes a day. Another way to get your mouth used to the retainer is to practice reading out loud at least five minutes a day. You could choose to read a passage from your favorite book or pick a random section of the newspaper. Reading out loud to yourself or to someone else allows you to practice speaking and pronouncing different words.[3]\n\nIt may be a good idea to read the same passage out loud every day until you feel you can read it one time through clearly and confidently. Once you have read the passage out loud successfully, you can try a longer passage or a passage with more complex terms and longer words.",
                "Try to sing part of a song at least once a day. Singing is another good way to help your mouth adapt to the retainer. You can sing the chorus of your favorite song to yourself in the shower or to an audience of family and friends. Maybe you choose a simple nursery rhyme or familiar tune that contains simple words. You can then practice singing this out loud once a day until you can sing the song clearly and without any issues.[4]",
                "Repeat words you find difficult to pronounce with your retainer. As you sing or read out loud, listen to yourself speak and note any words or phrases you may have trouble saying. This could be longer words or words with “sh” and hard “c” sounds, or also \"s,\" \"z,\" or \"t\", which require a certain position of the tongue over the retainer. You should repeat these words several times when you read them or sing them so you can practice pronouncing them. Over time, you should be able to say these challenging words properly while wearing your retainer.",
                "Speak more on weekends. If you are shy about talking during the week at school in class or to your peers in the hallways, you should get into the habit of talking with your retainer in your mouth on weekends. On the weekends, you may walk around the house and talk to yourself or talk to your parents. It can be less intimidating to talk to an empty room or to sympathetic parents.",
                "Brush your retainer at least once a day. Caring for your retainer can make it easier for you to talk while wearing it, as a clean retainer will not carry any odors or plaque build up. Odors and plaque build up can make it difficult to feel comfortable wearing the retainer and having in depth conversations with others. Keep your retainer clean and appealing by brushing it with toothpaste and a toothbrush at least once a day.[5]\n\nAsk your orthodontist about cleaning your retainer, as some retainers should be cleaned with water and a toothbrush, rather than toothpaste. Some toothpaste, especially abrasive toothpastes, can damage certain retainers.[6]\n\nAllowing plaque and bacteria to build up on your retainer is also harmful to your gums and teeth.\nIf your retainer seems to be carrying a very strong odor, despite regular brushing, you can try soaking it in a carbon tablet dissolved in water. Or you can dissolving a spoon of baking soda into a glass of water and allow your retainer to soak.",
                "Take out your retainer only to swim or eat. In order to do its job properly, your retainer should remain in your mouth most of the time. You should only take it out at mealtimes or when you are going swimming, as you do not want the retainer to come into contact with pool water.[7]\n\nYou should talk to your orthodontist about this rule, as some doctors have additional guidelines around when you should wear your retainer. You may be advised not to wear your retainer when you are playing contact sports or any other sports that can cause injury to your teeth or could break the retainer.",
                "Keep your retainer in its case when it is not in use. To avoid losing the retainer or damaging it, you should put your retainer in its case when it is not in your mouth. Put the retainer case in your backpack so you have it when you go to school and need to remove your retainer to eat or make sure it is always with you when you go to swim practice. Storing the retainer in its case will ensure it is safe and ready to use.[8]\n\nThe case should have a few holes to allow air to flow in and keep your retainer dry. A completely sealed case promotes the growth of bacteria by preventing your retainer from drying.",
                "Have your orthodontist adjust your retainer if it is uncomfortable or tight. If you have been practicing speaking with the retainer for over a month now and are noticing it is still uncomfortable and tight in your mouth, you may want to schedule a follow up appointment with your orthodontist.[9]\n\nYour orthodontist may suggest a different retainer for your mouth or adjust the one you have so it fits your mouth better. Some retainers can rub against your mouth due to a misplaced wire and your retainer may feel more comfortable with only a minor adjustment by your orthodontist."

            "steps": [
                "Clean the drain filter. No part of your dishwasher is more likely to responsible for strange odors than the drain filter. Food particles can collect here, and over time in a warm, moist environment they can become disgusting.[1]\n\nThere will probably be a cylindrical, detachable filter through which all of the water drains.\nIn order to access the filter, remove the bottom rack, then twist out the filter.\nWash the filter with soap and hot water in your sink. It may be difficult to reach all of the interior sections of it with a rag, so you may want to use a bottle brush.",
                "Wash the inside of the door and the interior walls. Smells may also come from grime that has accumulated throughout the inside of the dishwasher. You must scrub out the entire unit.[2]\n\nRemove all racks from the inside of the dishwasher. These will only get in your way when washing the interior of the dishwasher.\nUse a rag or brush and hot soapy water to scrub out the interior of the dishwasher. If grime has accumulated and is not easy to remove, consider also using some kitchen-safe household cleaners to help you scrub it out.",
                "Wash the door gasket. The seals of the dishwasher door can also accumulate moisture and grime and must be washed.",
                "Scrub the dishwasher racks in your sink. Though they are the unlikeliest cause of smell, you should make sure to rule out all of the simplest possibilities before you invest too much time and energy in the problem.",
                "Place one cup (8 oz) of distilled white vinegar in the top rack of the dishwasher. Despite its own smell, the acid in vinegar is one of the most potent smell-removing agents. Additionally, as it dries the smell of vinegar dissipates quickly.[3]\n\nMake sure the dishwasher is empty when you attempt to clean it in this way.",
                "Run the dishwasher for a full cycle. The vinegar will be blasted all over the interior of the dishwasher, and that is precisely the intention. The acids in the vinegar will help break down any residues that remain in the interior of your dishwasher.[4]",
                "Sprinkle a cup of baking soda over the bottom of the dishwasher. Baking soda is another well-known odor neutralizer, and following the vinegar shower with a rinse of baking soda has become a popular (and organically approved) solution to cleaning and smell-removal problems.[5]",
                "Run an additional cycle. This time the dishwasher should be run one of the shortest cycles available, and in order to dissolve all of the baking soda the water should be the hottest it can be. After this, the dishwasher should be clean and fresh smelling.",
                "Check the troubleshooting section of your dishwasher's manual. Most dishwashers will come with manuals that include troubleshooting sections that include specific cleaning instructions in just this kind of situation.\n\n\nMany dishwasher manuals are also available online for free. Websites such as ManualsOnline.com and ManualsLib.com are just a few of the many sites that have downloadable manuals for a variety of home appliances.",
                "Check the drain hose for obstructions. Especially check into this if there is water in the bottom of your dishwasher at the end of a cycle. It the drain hose has become bent or restricted, the flow of water can be limited and built-up water can become musty in the hose.\n\n\nIf the dishwasher can be pulled away from the wall, do so to check the hose.\nMost other dishwashers will be located next to the kitchen sink will have drain hoses that connect to the same kitchen drain pipe. You can detach the hose at whichever end is easier to access in order to inspect it.",
                "Make sure the dishwasher drain hose is installed at the correct point. Waste water from the sink can drain through the hose into the dishwasher if the drain hose is not looped up from the drain pipe before it is run to the dishwasher. The weight of a sink-full of water can push water back up through the dishwasher drain hose. If this appears to be a problem, raise the loop of the drain hose higher.",
                "Check the electrical connection. Examine the junction box behind the kick plate under the door of the dishwasher. A poor connection can produce an odor and is a fire hazard. Other problems can come from shorts in any of the electrical lines or a dysfunctional heater unit. If the dishwasher appears to have electrical problem, unplug it and call an electrician to fix the problem.[6]"

            "intro": "Pet turtles can be a great companion. Like all animals, turtles require careful care and attention to make sure they thrive and live healthy and full lives. From a proper habitat, nutrition, to water access, knowing your turtle's needs is an important part of pet ownership.",
            "steps": [
                "Provide an enclosure with adequate space. Ten gallons per inch of your turtle is a general rule. 50 gallon (189.3 L) minimum for a baby turtle (younger than a year old) and 120+ for an adult. Make sure that you have a general idea of the size your turtle will reach when full grown so you are not blindsided with keeping a turtle you cannot maintain. [1]\n\nDecide on a land or aquatic turtle. Common turtles like box turtles will require a desert like landscape. If you want an aquatic turtle make sure there is dry land and adequate room to swim, and that your enclosure is sealed enough to hold water.",
                "Provide proper filtration for aquatic turtles. A turtle needs a canister filter. A Rena Filstar XP3 or XP4 is highly recommended in keeping a turtle healthy. Without good filtration your turtle can get extremely sick as old food and feces can build up.[2]\n\nEven with proper filtration, you'll need to regularly change your turtle's water. When you change the water, make sure that the filter is not clogged. If you see waste or old food lingering in the filter, it may cause a clog that prevents it from filtering the water properly. You can buy a dechlorinator or water conditioner at any pet store.",
                "Clean your tank regularly. Remove everything from the tank including all of its basking spots and empty the water. Wash everything with warm water and anti-bacterial soap. Let rocks sit in warm water and soap. Wash the soap out thoroughly. Let the tank sit until it is dry. Put everything back in and fill the tank with clean, non-chlorinated water. If it is a land turtle, make sure to replace with clean substrate on the bottom of the tank each time, such as sand, wood chips, or newspaper. [3]\n\nHow often a clean is necessary will depend on how messy your turtle is. It is generally a good idea to do this at least twice a month. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the tank.",
                "Provide a balanced diet for your turtle. A proper diet for Red Eared Sliders and similar species should have the following proportions: Vegetables and water plants 50%; Commercial foods 25%; Live protein 25%. A turtle under a year old should be fed every day. A turtle over a year old should be fed every other day as to prevent them from getting overweight. [4]\n\nAn example of vegetation for your turtle are aquatic plants like duckweed, azolla, and water lettuce. They also enjoy fruits and vegetables like papaya, carrots, apples, and leafy greens like romaine lettuce.\nFor protein, your turtle can eat cooked chicken, turkey, or raw beef. If you want to feed your animal live protein, mealworms, snails, wax worms, beetle larvae, or even small goldfish are great.\nThere are also commercially available diets, such as pellets, that can provide complete nutrition for turtles. Make sure that you read the ingredients carefully and that proportions of protein and vegetable based matter are at proper ratios.",
                "Make sure your turtle has proper lighting. If your turtle does not have regular access to sunlight, you will need to provide UV light bulbs for basking. Turtles in the wild are exposed to sunlight every day and the nutrients they provide are essentially for healthy growth and development. The amount of light it needs will be based on the species with land turtles usually requiring more. [5]\n\nKeep in mind that that UV cannot penetrate glass and will need to above or in the enclosure.",
                "Maintain proper water temperatures. You will need a water heater. Turtles are cold-blooded animals and thus rely on external heat to warm up their bodies. If the temps get too high or too low it can turn fatal. The water should be 80 - 82 degrees Fahrenheit ( 26.5 - 27.5 Celsius) for a hatchling or a sick turtle, and 77 - 80 degrees F (25.5 - 26.5 C) for a healthy turtle over a year old.[6]\n\nThe basking (dry land) area should be 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) warmer than the water to entice the turtle to warm up by basking.",
                "Look for signs of sickness in your turtle. Even if you do your best to keep your turtle healthy, there are many diseases that can commonly affect the health of your pet. However, most are treatable if you look for certain telltale signs, you can start quickly getting your pet better.\n\n\nVitamin A deficiency. This occurs when your turtle is not getting a proper diet and manifests as lack of appetite, swelling of eyelids, swelling of ears, and persistent respiratory difficulties. This can also affect the buoyancy of your turtle when it's swimming. You can correct this by making sure your turtle has a balanced diet.\nRespiratory infections. The most common signs of this are wheezing, difficulty breathing, bubbles and mucus in their nose, and frequent coughing. If you see these symptoms, take your turtle to the vet who will give them an x-ray and determine the proper antibiotic course. The most common cause of these issues are improper basking and water temperatures or an exposure to drafty conditions.\nShell rot. This is a fungal condition to the shell. The symptoms include: white, slimy, smelly appearance of the shell and sometimes puss. The symptoms may also include small abrasions on the turtle's shell. If you see any of these signs, take your turtle to the vet who will prescribe antibiotics.\nParasites. These are the most common cause of illness. The most common parasites for turtles are: pinworms, roundworms, and hookworms. The signs include lack of appetite, undigested food in stool, weight loss and sometimes spit up of food. Your vet will ask you obtain a stool sample to test for parasites and give a medication targeted to rid the turtle of the specific parasite.\nFind a good vet that specializes in herpetology. Not all vets will deal with exotic animals. Make sure that whatever vet you choose has a specialty in herpetology and can help your turtle. Look online for a good local herp vet with strong reviews and demonstrated speciality background. Call local vet offices to see if they can treat turtles, or if they know a good colleague that can.",
                "Decide the type of turtle you want. There are different types of turtles available for purchase. These can present different difficulties in care, cost differences, and differences in how tame or docile the animal is. [7]\n\nPainted turtles are a great aquatic species for beginners. This is a colorful variety of turtle, readily available, easy to care for and great for a new turtle owner. They stay small, only 4 to 5 inches, and are active. They're also commonly bred in captivity and years of breeding has created a docile and tame animal. They are recognizable for their colorful markings that make them appear \"painted,\" hence the name.\nCommon Musk Turtles. These are a small, relatively hearty, aquatic turtle. They can rest comfortably in a small tank (as small as 30 gallons) but do not generally like to be handled.\nSlider turtles. There are many varieties of sliders with two being the most common — the red eared and yellow bellied slider. They stay under 11 inches and are easy to care for. They also have tame and docile personalities.\nDiamondback Terrapin. This is another type of turtle commonly available in pet stores and amongst breeders. While these turtles stay small (9 inches at the most) and are friendly, they require a little more expertise than either painted turtles or sliders. They prefer brackish water (a slightly salted water) and thus will require more work.",
                "Find a reputable turtle breeder or seller. Many pet stores will sell a variety of turtles. However, you will want to know the provenance of your turtle before bringing it home. This can include whether it was captive bred or caught from the wild. In addition to this you will want to make sure that the turtle is being kept in a proper habitat and appears alert and healthy. [8]\n\nAsk for proof that the turtle was captive bred. If the breeder cannot provide this, chances are the turtle was born in the wild. This can have detrimental effects on wild turtle populations and also make your turtle more prone to stress, which is potentially detrimental to the animal's health.",
                "Make sure you choose a healthy turtle. Since many turtles can be bred in poor conditions or undergo the stresses of being captured from the wild, it is important to choose a healthy looking turtle. The turtle should be alert, free of any parasites, and relatively active. You will want to see that the turtle has an appetite and looks properly fed. Their eyes should be clear, no bubbles from the nose while breathing or wheezing sounds. The limbs should be strong and moving when picked up; listlessness is a sign of illness. There should also be no cracks or pits in the shell or sign of wounds. [9]\n\nCheck the enclosure. The water should be clean, food should be available and adequate light provided. If any of these are missing, it can increase the likelihood you bring home a sick turtle.",
                "Make sure you are prepared for the turtle at home. Besides all of the commitment requirements, make sure that your turtle's habitat is ready to go before you pick the turtle up. This way they can start acclimating to their new life right away.",
                "Always practice safe handling. Whether you are the primary caregiver, or a child is regularly handling the turtle, be cognizant of potential diseases they may carry. Turtles can carry salmonella or other infectious diseases. This can also be contracted by contact with their enclosure. Make sure to practice safe handling measures and wash your hands thoroughly after each contact with the enclosure or turtle. [10]\n\nElderly people, children and infants are particularly susceptible to salmonella. Even if they are not directly interacting with the turtle or its environment, you will want to wash your hands thoroughly before coming in contact with at risk individuals."

        "wikiHow to Address the Pope": {
            "intro": "The Pope is the highest earthly office of the Catholic Church, and such an office demands respect, regardless of whether you are Catholic or not. As such, there are specific ways to address the Pope both in writing and in person. Here's what you need to know about each one.",
            "steps": [
                "Address the Pope as \"Your Holiness.\" Another acceptable way to address the Pope in writing would be \"Most Holy Father.\"\n\n\nNote, however, that on the envelope, you should address the Pope as “His Holiness, ________” with the Pope's name in the blank. For instance, if writing to Pope Francis, the envelope would read, “His Holiness, Pope Francis.”",
                "Maintain a respectful tone. Throughout the body of the letter, your tone should be polite and gracious. You do not need to write in flowery language, but your language should be on par with how you would speak or be expected to speak inside a Catholic church.\n\n\nAvoid swearing, slang, derogatory language, or any other forms of impolite speech.\nWrite out everything you need or want to say, but keep in mind that the Pope is a busy man. Instead of dragging on and spending extensive space on flattery, it would be better for all parties concerned if you kept the formalities basic and went directly into the purpose of your letter.",
                "Conclude the letter politely. As a Roman Catholic, you should conclude the letter with a sentence along the lines of, \"I have the honor to profess myself with the most profound respect. Your Holiness' most obedient and humble servant,\" before signing your name.[1]\n\nIf you are not a Catholic, you can change the closing to something along the lines of, \"With every good wish to Your Holiness, I am, Sincerely Yours,\" followed by your signature.\nSomething as simple as \"With every best wish. Sincerely yours,\" with a signature after it would also work for a non-Catholic writing to the Pope.\nRegardless of the exact wording you choose, the level of respect you demonstrate should correspond to the minimum level of respect you should have for someone in the Pope's position, at the very least. Someone who does not follow Catholic teaching or who disagrees with the Pope should still recognize his position of authority and close in a respectful manner. Anyone who does follow Catholic teaching should demonstrate the respect expected from one addressing the leader of his or her faith on Earth.",
                "Know the Vatican mailing address. If you plan to send your letter by traditional mail, you should write the address on the envelop as: His Holiness, Pope Francis / Apostolic Palace / 00120 Vatican City.\n\n\nNote that you should separate the address onto separate lines according to the placements of the slashes, /.\nOther ways to write the same address include:\n\nHis Holiness, Pope Francis PP. / 00120 Via del Pellegrino / Citta del Vaticano\nHis Holiness Pope Francis / Apostolic Palace / Vatican City\nHis Holiness Pope Francis / Vatican City State, 00120\n\n\nDo not write \"Italy\" on the envelop as the country. The Vatican is considered its own independent nation, completely separate from Italy.",
                "Know the email address and fax number for the Vatican Press Office. If you would rather send the letter by e-mail or fax, you must go through the Vatican Press Office. The Pope does not have a personal, public e-mail address or fax number.\n\n\nThe e-mail address is: av@pccs.va[2]\n\nThe fax number is: +390669885373\nNote that neither form of contact goes directly to the Pope, but correspondence you have for the Pope will get to him eventually when sent through either of these means.",
                "Refer to the Pope as \"Holy Father.” Other appropriate ways to address the Pope in person include \"Your Holiness\" and \"Most Holy Father.\"[3]\n\n“His Holiness” and “Holy Father” both address the Pope by his title and position in the Church. You should address the Pope only by these titles rather than by his name when speaking to him face-to-face.",
                "Stand and applaud as the Pope enters. The amount of applause will vary depending on the venue, but you should always stand in respect once the Pope walks into the room you are in.[4]\n\nUsually, if the venue is a small room with a small to mid-size crowd, the applause is quiet and polite.\nFor large venues, however, like a stadium Mass, loud applause and even cheers are appropriate.",
                "Genuflect as the Pope approaches. If the Pope approaches you directly, you should kneel with your right knee bent to the floor.\n\n\nYou do not need to make the Sign of the Cross, as you would do while genuflecting to the Eucharist, but you should still bend at the knee. Genuflection is a sign of high respect.",
                "Kiss his ring, when appropriate. If you are Catholic and if the Pope offers you his hand, that would be an appropriate time to plant a quick yet respectful kiss on the Piscatory ring, also known as the Ring of the Fisherman, traditionally worn by the Pope.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if the Pope offers you his hand and you are not Catholic, you are not obligated to kiss the ring. You could simply shake his hand, instead.\nThe Ring of the Fisherman is a symbol and mark of the office. By kissing it, you show both respect and sincere affection for the man who holds that office.",
                "Speak respectfully, clearly, and concisely. Plan what to say beforehand so that you do not stumble too much over your words, and maintain a tone that is both clear and respectful the entire time.\n\n\nStart by introducing yourself. Give your name and say something important or fitting about yourself.\nIf you came to the Vatican for a specific purpose or desired an audience with the Pope for a specific purpose, you should also state that.\nThe Pope will guide the conversation, and you should let him do so. Keep your answers direct and brief, and speak in a clear, loud voice so that the Pope can hear you.",
                "Stand up as the Pope leaves. As soon as the Pope stands to leave, you should stand, as well. Wait until he leaves the room before you sit down again or pay attention to anything else.\n\n\nApplause is not usually necessary at the end of the audience or event, but if you are in a large crowd and the crowd begins to applaud, it is appropriate to join in if you so desire."

            "intro": "If you're pregnant and are interested in finding out your baby's sex, you may want to know how to get a baby to move for an ultrasound. An ultrasound, which is also called a sonogram, is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of your baby, uterus and placenta. The ultrasound isn't only used to determine gender; the ultrasound technician will be looking for physical abnormalities on the baby, checking the location of the placenta, and measuring your baby's growth. In order to maximize the chance of determining your baby's sex, you may want to follow some tips on getting your baby to move around in utero, as movement enhances the chance that the ultrasound technician will be able to see your baby's genitals.",
            "steps": [
                "Drink apple or orange juice about 30 minutes before your appointment. The juices typically don't take too long to absorb into your bloodstream. The sugar in the juices tends to wake up your baby while in utero.\n\n\nAlso, if you didn't give up caffeine after finding out you're pregnant, you can opt for a cup of coffee or can of soda. The caffeine enters your bloodstream and might stimulate your baby to move around.",
                "Walk around before your ultrasound appointment. This could help if you feel as though your baby isn't moving and may be asleep. While walking can usually soothe and rock a baby to sleep from an awake state, it might also be able to wake up your baby from its in utero nap.",
                "Cough or laugh during your ultrasound appointment. Coughing and laughing can jostle your baby awake, which can increase your odds of the baby changing positions.\n\n\nIt can also help to engage in conversation with the ultrasound technician; however, you don't want to distract them as they are in the midst of important aspects of the ultrasound examination, so ask for permission prior to engaging them in conversation.",
                "Poke the baby gently. The ultrasound tech can use the probe to gently shake your baby and try to get the baby to move to a better position. You can also try using your own hands to jiggle or poke at your baby gently.",
                "Know that the \"first trimester ultrasound\" is done anywhere between 10 and 14 weeks. It is used as a method to confirm a pregnancy, or it is also used as a \"dating ultrasound\" for those women who cannot remember when their last menstrual period was and are unsure of how far along their pregnancy is. [1]\n\nWhat your doctor will look for during this first-trimester ultrasound is a heartbeat, as well as the presence of your baby inside the uterus (checking to make sure there are no pregnancy abnormalities. Your doctor can also use measuring tools on their computer (where the ultrasound is being recorded) to assess what is called the \"crown-to-rump length\" which is used to date the pregnancy.\nNot everyone receives a first-trimester ultrasound; rather, it is reserved for those patients whose doctors have early concerns about the pregnancy's success or uncertainty around dates. In general, everyone receives the second-trimester ultrasound which is a much more detailed assessment of their baby and occurs done between 18 and 20 weeks. [2]\n\nExternal sex organs have not developed at this point so the doctor won't be able to determine sex during this ultrasound.",
                "Understand that the \"second trimester ultrasound\" is more detailed. It is usually done between 18 and 20 weeks, and is able to assess for a variety of things including the baby's sex (in most cases), as well as overall growth and development. [3]\n\nIt is this second-trimester ultrasound where you will be interested in strategies in getting your baby to move. One particular reason couples are interested in this is that with more movement there is a greater chance the ultrasound technician can determine the sex of the baby (which is of interest to many people).\nThe baby's sex (male or female) can be determined on second-trimester ultrasound by the presence or absence of a penis, which is usually observable with sufficient fetal movement (or if the baby happens to be in a position where this can be seen from the outset).",
                "Be aware that third trimester ultrasounds are rare. They are only done in more complicated cases where your doctor wants to check on the baby (for instance checking fluid levels, getting measurements, or monitoring in special cases such as with gestational diabetes).[4]"

        "wikiHow to Clean a Trumpet": {
            "intro": "Cleaning your trumpet is a relatively easy process that can increase the life and performance of your instrument. Simply give your trumpet a bath every so often, and keep it clean and in good care in between washes. If you notice something is off about your trumpet at any time, make sure you take it to a professional so that they can properly fix your instrument.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather your materials. To clean your trumpet you will need a large bin, bucket, or bath tub to place your trumpet in. You will also need two long towels to lay the horn on, a wash cloth, and a polishing cloth to dry the horn with without scuffing the finish. Some dish soap, brushes, including a snake brush and pipe cleaner, will be used to clean your trumpet. Finally, you will need valve oil and slide grease to properly oil your trumpet when you reassemble it.[1]\n\nYou can usually find the oil and grease at an instrument or music store. If you aren't sure what type of grease and oil to buy, ask one of the workers what they would use for their instrument. You can also purchase kits online that are specifically created to clean trumpets and bass instruments.\nIf you don't have a polishing cloth, you can use a microfiber cloth or an old cotton t-shirt. If using a shirt, make sure it is one that has been washed a lot and doesn't have any text on it. You want to avoid scuffing your instrument at all cost. Never use a regular towel to dry off your instrument.",
                "Disassemble your trumpet.(Hold your valves when putting it back in) To wash your trumpet, you will want to disassemble it so you can effectively clean all areas of your instrument.Take apart all pieces of your instrument, but once you twist and unscrew the springs and felt pads that are inside the valves, set them aside. You will not clean these as they can get damaged if wet. Be careful not to dent any of the pieces as you take apart your trumpet.[2]\n\nMake sure you keep track of how the pieces fit together as you take apart your trumpet.\nIf your valves get wet it can affect their shape and hinder the valves' performance. If the springs get wet it can lead to deterioration.\nSometimes if your valves are not properly oiled, they can get stuck in your trumpet. Removing these parts and the slides should not require much force, so if you are finding it difficult to take them apart, they may be stuck. Don't force them out as this can damage your trumpet. Take your trumpet to a professional so that they can dissemble your trumpet without damaging it.[3]",
                "Fill up a bathtub. Fill up your bathtub about halfway with lukewarm water. As the water is filling the tub, squirt a few drops of dish soap into the water. Make sure you plug up the drain in the bath tub so the water doesn't run out.[4]\n\nUsing hot water can damage the trumpets finish, so make sure that the water is warm to touch. Cold water won't damage your trumpet necessarily, but it also won't give your trumpet the most effective soaking.[5]\n\nIf you don't have a tub, you can use a large bucket and fill it with water. Make sure the bucket is long and deep enough that you can lay your trumpet flat in the water.",
                "Place a towel down in the tub. When you place your trumpet in the tub, you don't want it to dent on the hard surface. Placing a towel down will give it some padding and prevent it from getting banged up while you are cleaning it. Take one of your long towels and set it at the bottom of the tub, spreading it out so it fully covers the bottom of the tub.[6]",
                "Set your trumpet parts down to soak. Once the tub is halfway full, stop the water flow. Then, set the trumpet and its parts down into the water on the towel.(If you wash you're valves it could ruin the felt) Space them out so that they don't bump up against each other in the water. Allow them to soak for 20 minutes or so, letting the dish soap effectively clean them.(The mouthpiece should be in hot water to clean better) [7]",
                "Clean out the trumpet. After your trumpet has soaked for some time you can begin to clean it out. Using your snake brush and pipe cleaners, clean out the insides of your slides. Run your brushes through the valve casings a few times. Spend some time cleaning out the area closest to the mouth piece. This area usually gets a lot of build up and bacteria, so you'll want to clean it out thoroughly.[8]",
                "Clean the exterior with a washcloth. Leave your trumpet soaking in the water. Then, take a washcloth and dip it in the tub, getting it soaking wet. Then, gently rub the exterior of your trumpet with the washcloth, cleaning any dirt or dust off your trumpet. Make sure you don't brush roughly as this can create scuff marks.[9]",
                "Wash pieces out. After you have thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed all of your pieces, unplug the drain in the tub. As the water begins to drain, turn the faucet back on and rinse out your pieces under lukewarm water. Place a towel down on the floor outside of the tub. After you have rinsed out a piece, place it on the towel.[10]",
                "Use the polishing cloth to lightly dry your pieces. You want to avoid creating scuff marks on your trumpet at all cost, so make sure you are using a cloth that will not scratch your trumpet. Gently take the cloth and wipe down your instruments, removing the excess water. Then, set them back down on the towel and allow them to air dry the rest of the way.[11]\n\nAir drying them will take longer, but it creates the least amount of risk of scuffing your instrument. You can place them in a sunny area for faster drying, or give it a few more hours if you want them to dry inside.\nMake sure you have thoroughly dried out your valves. When the felt pads touch the valves, you do not want them to get wet as this will cause them to lose their shock-absorbing ability. Wipe down the inside and outside of the vales until completely dry, and then allow them to air dry even more.[12]",
                "Put pieces back together and oil your instrument. After your trumpet has dried completely, you can put it back together (it's okay if the mouthpiece is still a little wet as brass instruments are used to a little moisture). As you put your trumpet back together, grease the first and third slides and oil the valves modestly. [13]\n\nMake sure you don't cake the oil and grease on as this can create build up and hinder the performance of your instrument. Put just enough that the slides and valves can effectively be put back together.\nWhen you put the valve back into its casing, try not to rotate it as this can cause excessive wear. Carefully insert it into its casing until you hear a \"click.\"[14]",
                "Be gentle with it. Brass instruments dent easily and when they are dented it makes the instrument more difficult to play. Be careful with your instrument, placing it back in its case or on your lap when you can. Denting your instrument can cause valves or slides to stick. If this happens to your instrument, take it to a repair store so they can fix it professionally.",
                "Reapply oil to the valve. This should be done every day or two. Remove the valves from their casing, paying attention to how they fit so you can properly insert them back in. Then, put three to five drops of oil on each valve. Gently place it back in its casing and repeat a few times a week, or when your valves are sticking.[15]",
                "Wipe it down regularly. To keep excessive dirt and grime from building up on your trumpet, try to wipe it down daily with a polishing or microfiber cloth. Wipe down all sides of the instrument, especially the areas where you hold the trumpet. This will help keep the trumpet relatively clean between washes.[16]\n\nTry to wash the cloth about once a month. Because it will soak up oils and grease from your instrument, it needs to be cleaned along with your trumpet. You don't want to use a dirty cloth, because it won't get the job done.",
                "Wash your instrument every month. While you want to consistently wipe down your instrument when using it, every month or so it will still need a good, deep cleaning. Give your trumpet a \"bath\" once a month, or once every other month depending on how often you use it. This will keep it in the best condition and allow the trumpet to perform at its best.[17]"

        "How to Make Body Scrub": {
            "intro": "Body scrubs are a great way to exfoliate and moisturize your skin and make you feel great! Unfortunately, store-bought body scrubs can not only be expensive, but and can also contain harmful and unnecessary ingredients. Fortunately, body scrubs are easy to make at home, and the ingredients for the most basic recipe are most likely already in your pantry: sugar and oil. This article will show you not only how to make your sugar scrub, but also how to choose your ingredients and customize your scrub.",
            "steps": [
                "Decide how and where you will use your body scrub. Where you will use your body scrub will determine what ingredients you will use. There are body scrubs for tough, calloused areas such as elbows and heels, and body scrubs for tender areas such as the lips.\n\n\nUse body scrubs containing abrasive exfoliates, such as sugar, on tough, calloused areas. If you use an abrasive scrub, then you may have to moisturize your skin afterwards with lotion or body butter.\nUse body scrubs containing moisturizing exfoliants, such as sugar, on the rest of the body.\nIf you want to use your scrub on your face or lips, then avoid abrasive exfoliants. Use essential oils and colorants with caution to avoid irritation.",
                "Choose your exfoliant. You will need 2 parts of exfoliant to 1 part carrier oil. There are many different types of exfoliant you can use in your body scrub, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\n\nEpsom salts are great for detoxifying and moisturizing the skin. They are not very abrasive and can be used on the rest of the body.\nGround coffee helps tighten the blood vessels and may help varicose veins go away for a little bit. It is also good for making the skin appear brighter.[1]\n\nOatmeal is gentle and moisturizing. It also helps your skin feel softer.\nSalt is harsher and more abrasive than other exfoliants, which makes it perfect for tough, calloused areas like elbows, knees, and heels. Sea salt is particularly good for detoxifying the skin and unblocking pores.[2]\n\nSugar is the most common exfoliant found in body scrubs. It's gentler than some other exfoliants, such as salt, and good for reintroducing moisture into the skin.[3] You can use white sugar or brown sugar.",
                "Choose your carrier oil. You will need 1 part carrier oil to 2 parts of exfoliant. There are many different types of oil you can use, so long as they are intended for cooking purposes. Each oil has different properties, such as scent and consistency, and some might help reduce skin problems, such as dryness.\n\n\nAvocado oil is rich, thick, and moisturizing. It is good for dry and sensitive skin types.[4]\n\nCoconut oil is thick, luxurious, and moisturizing. You will need to melt it first either in a saucepan over the stove or in a microwave.\nGrape seed oil has a light, sweet smell. It is also thin compared to the other oils. It is not absorbed by the skin as easily as sunflower oil, and leaves a thin coating on your skin.\nMacadamia nut oil is thick and moisturizing, which makes it ideal for dry skin.[5]\n\nOlive oil is the most common carrier oil. It is easy to find, and is good for all skin types.\nSesame oil seed oil has a medium consistency, and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It is good for all skin types.\nRapeseed oil has a medium consistency, and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It is good for dry and sensitive skin types.\nSunflower oil is thin compared to other oils. It is easily absorbed by the skin, and is good for all skin types.[6]\n\nSweet almond oil smells sweet, nut-like smell. It has a medium consistency, but is absorbed quickly and easily into the skin.",
                "Consider substituting your carrier oil. If you do not wish to use a carrier oil, you can use something else instead. You can also combine your carrier oil with another liquid ingredient. For example:\n\n\nHoney can be used instead of a carrier oil, or it can be combined with a carrier oil. It is a great cleanser and moisturizer. It can also be used in lip scrubs.\nMilk soothes and moisturizes the skin. It will also create a thinner body scrub. It can be added to the oil, or used in place of it. If you add milk to your scrub, use it within a few days.[7]\n\nYogurt is great for moisturizing and brightening the skin. Like honey, it can be substituted for the carrier oil, or it can be used in combination with the carrier oil. If you choose to use yogurt in your scrub, use it within a few days.[8]",
                "Decide what essential oil you want your scrub to have, if any. Essential oils can not only add fragrance to your scrub, but they can also help remedy skin problems, such as acne and excessive dryness. Some essential oils are also used in aromatherapy and can help lighten your mood.\n\n\nSoothing and relaxing oils include: lavender, rose, and sandalwood\nEnergizing oils include: grapefruit and lemon.\nCooling oils include: mint and peppermint. These are great for calloused areas, like heels.\nBergamot essential oil is good for all skin types. It can also help remedy acne and eczema.[9]\n\nLavender essential oil not only smells great and helps sooth the senses, but it is also beneficial for dry and aging skin types.\nRosemary essential oil has a fresh, woody scent. It is good for all skin types, including aging skin. It can also help remedy oily skin and acne.[10]\n\nSandalwood oil is good for all skin types, including sensitive skin. It can help moisturize dry skin as well.[11]\n\nTea tree oil is good for all skin types, especially oily skin, and can help remedy acne.[12]\n\nYlang ylang essential oil is good for oily skin. It is also a home remedy for acne. Consider using this in a facial scrub.[13]",
                "Decide what additional benefits you want your scrub to have. Do you want your scrub to just exfoliate your skin, or do you want it to have additional properties?\n\n\nActivated charcoal is great for facial scrubs. It can be mixed in with other exfoliants, such as sugar, or used in place of one. It is great for detoxifying skin and clearing out blackheads.\nBaking soda is also great for facial scrubs, and is often used as a home remedy for acne. It can be added to other exfoliants, or used on its own.\nCocoa butter and shea butter can make your scrub luxurious and moisturizing. You may have to soften or melt your butter in the microwave first, before adding it to your scrub.\nHerbal teas can be added to your scrub. There are different types of teas that help remedy different types of skin problems. Chamomile and green teas are great for all skin types. Peppermint, sage, and thyme are great for oily skin, while calendula, lavender, and rose are beneficial for dry skin.[14]\n\nLemon and grapefruit juice can help freshen and brighten the skin. It can also add some aroma to your scrub.",
                "Decide if you want your body scrub to have a special appearance. You can leave your body scrub plain, as it is, or you can choose to add some color and shimmer.\n\n\nMica powders, purchased from soap-making shops, will make your body scrub shimmery.\nSoap colorants can add color to your scrub. They come either in liquid form, in dye blocks, or as powders.\nFood coloring can also add color to your scrub.\nFruit can add some color and scent to your body scrub. Consider crushing some berries or squeeze juice from a citrus and adding that to your scrub. If you choose to do this, however, use your scrub within a few days.\nAvoid adding shimmer and color to your scrub if you intend to use it on your lips. Instead, consider adding chap stick or lip balm.",
                "Put your chosen exfoliant into a bowl. You can start out with 1 cup of exfoliant, or use 2 parts exfoliant to 1 part carrier oil.",
                "Add your chosen carrier oil. You can start out with ¼ to ½ cup of carrier oil. The less oil you use, the more abrasive your scrub will be, and the more oil you use, the more moisturizing it will be. You can also use 1 part carrier oil to 2 parts exfoliant.\n\n\nConsider substituting your carrier oil with honey, milk, or yogurt.\nIf your carrier oil is particularly thick, like coconut oil, you will need to melt it in a saucepan over a stove, or in a heat-resistant cup in the microwave.",
                "Stir your ingredients together. Use a large wooden spoon or a spatula to mix your ingredients together. The exfoliant will not completely dissolve, which is what you want. You will end up with a grainy texture. If you want your scrub to be more abrasive, then add more of your exfoliant. If you want your scrub to be smoother and gentler, then add more of your carrier oil.\n\n\nAt this point, you can put your scrub into a jar, or you can continue adding other ingredients.",
                "Add the essential oil. If you choose to use essential oil in your scrub, you can add it now. Use anywhere between 5 to 10 drops. If you are using a small amount of exfoliant and carrier oil, then you may have to use less essential oil.",
                "Add everything else. If you are adding additional ingredients, such as honey, fruit juices, or colorants, do so now.\n\n\nFor liquid dyes and food coloring, start with a few drops. Do not add too much, or else you risk coloring your skin. You want the color to the subtle and pale.\nFor powder colorants and mica powders, start with a pinch or too. As with the liquid colorants, you do not want to add too much, or else you will risk staining your skin.\nFor other ingredients, such as butters, herbal teas, honey, juices, and yogurt, start with 1 tablespoon, and continue adding more to your taste. If you are making a smaller batch, then start with a smaller amount, such as a teaspoon.\nIf your scrub is starting to get too runny and lose its grainy texture, the exfoliant might just be settling. Give it a stir. If that does not help, you have added too many additives. Remedy this by adding in more of your exfoliant.",
                "Mix your scrub again. Once you have finished adding your optional ingredients, such as essential oils, additives, and dyes, you will need to stir your scrub again to mix everything together.",
                "Put your scrub into a container. Once you have finished combining all of your ingredients, transfer your scrub into a container and store it in the refrigerator. You can use any container you want, as long as it has a lid. The best containers have a lid that either screws on, or closes with a latch.",
                "Store your body scrub in the fridge. Because you made your body scrub at home, it does not have the preservatives that many commercial scrubs do. Keep the container sealed and store it in the fridge when you are not using it.",
                "Use your body scrub in the bath or shower. You can rub the scrub over your skin while you are taking a bath or shower. Be sure to rinse it off.\n\n\nIf you are using a lip scrub, simply rub it over your lips, and either wash it off or lick it off.",
                "Do not use your scrub every day. Instead, treat yourself to your body scrub once or twice a week. Using it too much may over-exfoliate your skin and irritate it.",
                "Consider giving your body scrub away as a gift. Body scrubs can make great, customizable gifts for birthdays, bridesmaids, Mother's Day, and other occasions. Put your body scrub into a glass jar and give it away as a gift. You can customize your jar as well:\n\n\nDesign and print a colorful label. You can put this label on the jar itself, or on the lid.\nPaint the lid of the jar a color that compliments the color of the scrub.\nUse chalkboard paint to paint a patch on the jar, then use chalk to write a message on the \"label\" once the paint dries.\nTie twine or ribbon around the jar.",
                "Consider selling your scrubs. Homemade beauty products are popular, and you can even start your own business selling them. Consider opening a shop online, or selling your products at farmers' markets or art and wine festivals.\n\n\nIf you are selling your products online, do not make them in advance. Body scrubs are perishable, and you do not want to sell your customer an expired product, or a product that will expire before he or she can enjoy it."

        "How to Start a T Shirt Business": {
            "intro": "T-shirt businesses are fairly common nowadays, but don't be fooled: starting your own t-shirt business won't be easy and won't produce a steady source of income overnight. To make your business successful, you'll need to do plenty of research and design high-quality merchandise people will actually be interested in buying.",
            "steps": [
                "Identify your target market. Since the t-shirt market is already so developed, your own business won't survive long if you try to compete with every other t-shirt business. Instead, focus on one target market or niche.\n\n\nMake your target market specific without becoming too obscure. For example, \"funny graphic shirts\" would be a bad market since it's too broad. A better choice would be something like \"funny graphic shirts about cooking and baking\" since that addresses a focused yet widespread target group.",
                "Study the competition. Learn about other t-shirt sellers who share similar a similar niche. You'll need to be able to compete with them on all levels so that customers will be willing to choose your product over theirs.\n\n\nPay attention to your competitors' product quality, design variety, pricing, and customer service. Also note how they promote their products.\nStudying the competition isn't as hard as you might initially believe it to be. Follow the brands on their blogs and social media pages, and sign up for their free digital newsletters.",
                "Hire partners and other employees. Even if you're starting the business on your own, you'll probably need to hire help and delegate tasks to other people. Focus your efforts on the business aspects that come naturally to you, then hire partners to help you with the rest.[1]\n\nA successful t-shirt business needs skilled designers and printers, but it also needs people who can make websites, manage people, and market the product. Moreover, if you struggle to manage your finances, you might also need to hire an accountant or someone else to do that for you.\nEven if you have some skill in each area, you will probably need to hire partners as your business grows simply to keep up with the demand.",
                "Choose the best print method for your business. There are three main print methods used by t-shirt businesses: screen printing, heat transfer, and direct-to-garment. Each option has pros and cons, so you'll need to figure out which one is right for your intended business model.[2]\n\nScreen printing is cost-effective for large batches, but it can be expensive if you want to offer multiple colors. It also works best with simple designs, and the quality can start decreasing once designs become too complex.\nHeat transfers make it easier to print shirts on demand. The designs need to be professionally printed on high-quality heat transfer paper, but you'll need to invest in a heat press machine and transfer the design to each shirt yourself. The overall quality is less durable than screen printing and direct-to-garment printing, too.\nDirect-to-garment printing creates high-quality images and makes it easier to produce small orders in a wide range of colors. The designs themselves can also be very detailed without a drop in quality. It won't be very cost effective for large production runs, though.",
                "Set goals. Establishing specific business goals will make it easier for you to know what you're working toward. If you don't set any goals, you can easily become aimless and find your business struggling as a result.[3]\n\nSet long-term and short-term goals. Determine how many shirts you plan to sell this year, month, and week. Once you start meeting your short-term goals, you can adjust your future short-term and current long-term goals accordingly.",
                "Organize your financial records. You should understand your financial situation before you even enter the designing phase of your business. Make sure that you're keeping a record of your finances throughout the entire process, as well.\n\n\nKeep all of your business expenses on the same bank account and credit card. If possible, don't use this account or card for anything other than your business.\nKnow what to expect before money starts changing hands. Get quotes from multiple printers and compare cost to value. Factor in the cost of labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping supplies, too. Ultimately, the cost of production will be the key factor in determining the sale price of your product.",
                "Establish your own brand. Even if you only have two or three designs, you should still market them as part of a larger brand instead of selling them separately and anonymously. Keep the content and quality of your shirts consistent across the brand.\n\n\nCreating a brand will make it easier to advertise. Customers who purchase from you will associate the t-shirt with your brand, and might be more likely to return to your brand later or recommend it to others.\nAdditionally, creating a brand before you start selling will make it easier to expand your business if you decide to add more designs later.",
                "Create unique designs. The graphics and slogans used on your shirts don't need to be complex, but they must be original enough to stand out in a flooded market. You can design everything yourself if that's your area of expertise, but if it isn't, work with a designer to create something that works.\n\n\nCheck out online design communities like Dribbble and Behance, or freelance networks like Freelancer and Elance. Search through the work of existing freelance designers in these networks and contact the designers you like about working with you.",
                "Check your design. Before finalizing your design, check the way it looks on digital mockup images. Since customers will want to see the design before buying, you'll need to make these same images available to customers once you start selling.\n\n\nYou could use photo imaging software and digital t-shirt templates to create your own design previews.\nAlternatively, you can skip the digital mockup and simply print one sample shirt with that design. If you choose to sell that particular design, take a digital photograph to show your customers how it looks.",
                "Use high-quality materials. Take time to choose the right type of blank shirts for your business. Aside from the cost, you also need to choose blank shirts made with comfortable material. The fit and sizing of those shirts should be agreeable, as well.\n\n\nDo your own research and make a choice based on your own interests and needs. A few popular t-shirt blanks include All style , Alternative Apparel, American Apparel, Anvil, Gildan, and Tultex.[4]\n\nOnce you narrow down your choices, order a blank from each company and check the product itself before finalizing your decision.",
                "Find the right printer. No matter which print method you choose, you'll need to hire the services of a professional printer. Do your research to determine which printers might offer the best price and service for your business's needs.\n\n\nIf you print using heat transfers, you should look for local print shops that can work with you. You'll also need to invest in a high-quality heat press machine\n\nIf you use screen printing or direct-to-garment printing, find online printers with good reputations. Note that screen printers will often print batches and ship them to you, but direct-to-garment printers will usually print individual shirts and ship them directly to the consumer.",
                "Test the quality of the final product. Order or print up a sample version of your product to check the quality of your merchandise. You'll need to sell high-quality products if you want your business to survive past the first few months.\n\n\nIf you're dissatisfied with the way the product looks, figure out what the problem is and correct it. The design might not look as good in print as it did digitally, and the problem may lie with the design itself, the printing method you chose for it, or the company doing the actual printing.",
                "Get feedback before opening shop. Run the design and final product past potential customers before rolling it out and trying to sell it. Make sure that there's interest in a design before you invest the time and money required to sell it.\n\n\nPost images of the design on social network pages. Understand that friends and relatives might be biased toward you, however, so some of the feedback might be idealistically positive instead of realistically so.\nConsider running a crowd-funding campaign. If people like your design well enough to pledge money to it, the design itself has good odds of success.",
                "Pick an online market platform. You can either create your own website or rely on a third party website to host the online storefront of your business. There are pros and cons to either option.[5]\n\nCreating your own website allows you to have more control over how merchandise is displayed and sold. It can cost more money, however, and it might be more difficult to inform potential customers about your brand.\nThird party websites can be less expensive at the time of start-up, but you'll usually have to split the cost of each sale, so you'll need to sell your shirts at a higher cost or settle for a smaller profit. This can still be a great option, though, if you aren't confident about your ability to maintain your own website or market your product independently.",
                "Consider non-digital sales. Many—if not most—contemporary t-shirt businesses strictly sell their product online, especially if they use direct-to-garment printing. If you print using heat transfers or screen printing, however, you might want to consider selling some of your products at craft shows and related events.\n\n\nIf you someday hope to sell your shirts in stores, be honest about that goal and make a conscious effort to strive for it. It might be difficult to achieve at the start of your business, but if you can become successful online and at small in-person venues, you can maximize your odds of someday selling your wares at an actual storefront.",
                "Advertise online. Since most of your sales will probably be online, most of your advertising will likely be online, too. Many forms of online advertising are even free, which is great if you don't have a large marketing budget.\n\n\nEstablish business accounts on social networks like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Instagram. You can also connect to your customers directly through e-mail lists and blogs.\nNetwork with t-shirt blogs and other blogs connected to your target market. As you establish good connections to these other bloggers, you can ask them to help your business by making a note of it on their blogs.\nFree forms of advertising can be a good start, but you'll eventually need to put money into marketing if you want your business to continue expanding. Do your research on paid online advertisements to determine which might be the best setup for your brand.",
                "Market your brand in person. Even if your business is primarily or entirely online, you should still do a little marketing in person. Traditional advertisements might not be very cost-effective for this type of business, so focus most of your efforts on promotional advertising.\n\n\nEssentially, promotional advertising heavily relies on your willingness to give out freebies. If you can factor it into your budget, give out a handful of free t-shirts at an event or donate old stock to secondhand store. Consider sponsoring a local little league or bowling team, and provide the shirts free-of-cost. You can also give out stickers, postcards, and other small promotional stickers.[6]",
                "Be persistent. Don't expect immediate success. Running any business will require a considerable amount of hard work, and you'll need to keep working at it to achieve success.\n\n\nIf your shirts are selling, identify the problem and try to fix it. It could be an issue with the design, the price, or the overall quality.\nContinue to analyze your strategies and plans throughout the life of your business, even when it's experiencing success. Never settle for “good enough.” You should make your business the best it can be.",
                "Enjoy your work. It'll be much easier to remain passionate about your t-shirt business if you enjoy the work, so do what you can to blend your passions into your overall business model.\n\n\nIt's perfectly normal to feel burned out at times, but you can't let those periods slow you down. Read motivational books or find out what others are doing to make their businesses both successful and enjoyable. Seek advice from mentors, and go to past customers and supports for encouragement."

        "How to Make Royal Icing": {
            "intro": "Royal icing is a delicious, gluey concoction used to hold gingerbread houses, faerie houses, and other edible crafts projects together. It will dry rock-hard and provide very good adhesion between porous cookie surfaces.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather your ingredients. Here's what you'll need to make about four cups of royal icing with egg whites:\n\n3 cups (700 mL) powdered sugar, plus additional as necessary\n2 egg whites\n1 tsp (5 mL) lemon juice",
                "Sift the powdered sugar into a bowl. Sifting is not necessary but will help keep your icing from getting lumpy.",
                "Separate the egg whites into a separate bowl. Crack an egg and then turn it crack-side up. As you gently open it, use half of the shell to catch the yolk. Allow white to drain by transferring yolk from one half of the shell to the other several times.\n\nConsider saving the yolk for homemade mayonnaise or Hollandaise sauce.",
                "Combine lemon juice and egg whites and mix briefly with a wire whisk. You don't have to whisk much or for long. Whisking for 20 seconds will help break up the egg whites and combine it with the lemon juice.",
                "In a stand mixer, combine the lemon juice and egg white mixture with the sugar, adding the sugar a little at a time. Start with 1 1/2 cups or 2 cups of sugar, and gradually add the rest while the mixer is on its medium setting. Mix until shiny and opaque, about 5 minutes.\n\nHand mixers also do the trick just fine if you do not have a stand mixer. In a pinch, a little bit of old-fashioned hard work will work as well, although you'll be getting a considerable workout.\nFor edible construction projects like gingerbread houses, a thicker, more peanut-buttery consistency will provide extra stability.",
                "For icing to be used as piping, mix the royal icing until soft peaks begin forming. Soft peaks are contoured without being firm; when you dip your whisk into the icing and turn it upside down, the peaks move back in on themselves.[1]\n\nTo make your own icing tube, simply put the icing in a Ziploc bag and snip off one of the bottom corners. Start by cutting off very little of the corner to keep your icing lines thinner and more manageable. You can always snip more away as you go.",
                "Continue mixing and adding sugar, 2 teaspoons at a time, for firmer peaks. If you want firm peaks for your icing, continue adding sugar a little bit at a time while the mixer is still beating. The additional sugar will create a stiffer icing.",
                "Adjust as necessary with sugar, water, or egg whites. You probably have a good idea of how you want your icing to turn out. However, sometimes, things don't happen according to plan. If you need to change the consistency of your icing — it's too stiff, for example — don't fret. Here's how you adjust the consistency of your icing:\n\nIf your icing is too runny, add more sugar. A little bit at a time works best.\nIf your icing is too stiff, add more egg white. Again, a little goes a long way.\nIf you want to runny icing, add water, a couple drops at a time, to the icing.[2] Whisk the icing and wait for the peaks to break up. Since this process causes air-bubbles to form, rest runny icing for up to 30 minutes before using to allow time for the air bubbles to dissipate.",
                "Use royal icing immediately or transfer to an airtight container. Royal icing hardens very quickly if not properly stored.",
                "Gather your ingredients. Here's what you'll need to make about 5 cups of royal icing with meringue powder:\n\n4 cups (950 mL) confectioners' (powdered or icing) sugar\n3 tablespoons (15 mL) meringue powder\n1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) extract (vanilla, lemon, almond)\n1/2 - 3/4 cup (120 - 180 mL) warm water",
                "Check the label on your meringue powder. Many meringue powder labels contain specific instructions on how to make royal icing using their product — with powders varying from one product to the next. Adjust the recipe keeping the manufacturer's suggestions on the label in mind.",
                "In a stand- or electric mixer, beat the sugar and meringue powder on low until fully combined.",
                "Add warm water and beat on medium or high until icing becomes glossy and peaks begin to form. This whole process takes anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes.[3]",
                "Adjust with more powdered sugar or water as needed. When using royal icing as the glue with which to bind a gingerbread house, for example, you probably want stiffer peaks. In this case, add more sugar. When flooding a cookie, for example, you probably want a runnier icing. In this case, add more water.\n\nIcing is ready to be used in flooding a cookie when the icing runs off the surface of the beater tong when it's lifted from the mixer.",
                "Use royal icing immediately or transfer to an airtight container. Royal icing hardens quickly if not properly stored.",
                "Finished.",
                "Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n\n1 cup confectioners sugar\n2 teaspoons non-dairy milk (rice, soy, almond); or use water\n2 teaspoons light corn syrup\n1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\nColoring (if needed) - either paste or powder.",
                "Add the confectioners sugar to a medium mixing bowl. Add the non-dairy milk or the water.",
                "Stir the ingredients together until a smooth paste forms.",
                "Pour in the corn syrup and vanilla extract. The icing will start to look glossy; it is now ready for use.\n\nIf it seems too thick, add a little more corn syrup.",
                "If adding food coloring, remove even amounts from the bowl. Place the divided pieces in different bowls and add the food coloring according to the packaging instructions.",
                "Use the royal icing straight away. If not using it immediately, place under a clean, damp cloth to keep the moisture intact."

        "How to Cure Vaginal Infections Without Using Medications": {
            "intro": "If you experience itching, burning, or a change in your vaginal discharge, you may have a vaginal infection. This wikiHow will show you how to treat them without using medications. Keep in mind that it is important to consult your doctor whenever you experience vaginal infection symptoms.",
            "steps": [
                "Recognize the symptoms of BV. Bacterial vaginosis is typically marked by certain symptoms. These include:[1]\n\nVaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor, often described as “fishy”.\nVaginal discharge that is white or grey and may look foamy\nBurning on urination\nItchiness and irritation around the vagina\nKeep in mind that not all women with BV have symptoms.",
                "Recognize the symptoms of a yeast infection. Yeast infection symptoms can often resemble the symptoms of BV. These symptoms include:[2]\n\nAn abnormal vaginal discharge. The discharge can be a watery, white discharge to a thick, white, and chunky discharge. This is often described as looking like cottage cheese.\nItching and burning of the vagina and labia\nPainful intercourse\nPainful urination\nRedness and swelling of the area just outside of the vagina.",
                "Recognize the symptoms of trichomoniasis. Symptoms of trichomoniasis (sometimes called “trich”) in women can be:[3]\n\nVaginal discharge that is usually smelly or itchy\nVaginal discharge that is typically frothy or foamy\nVaginal itching\nYellow or a gray-green discharge\nPainful urination",
                "Keep track of your menstrual cycle. Vaginal infection symptoms can differ depending on where a woman is in her cycle. This is because the hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle can affect the composition of the bacteria in the vagina and the characteristics of the vaginal environment. [4]\n\nKnowing your menstrual cycle will help you keep track of changes that you’re experiencing.",
                "Realize that some women experience no symptoms. Many women have BV or trichomoniasis but they do not have any of the tell-tale symptoms.[5]\n\nIf you suspect you might have an infection, see your doctor.\nTrichomoniasis can be transmitted to sexual partners. If you suspect you have trich, see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment.",
                "Know that the risk of BV increases with certain activities. Most women have probably had at least one experience with BV. There is no specific cause. Essentially anything that disrupts the normal bacterial balance in the vagina can result in BV. The risk of BV increases with:[6]\n\nHaving a new sexual partner\nHaving multiple sexual partners\nHaving sex without a condom\nDouching\nUsing an intrauterine device (IUD) as a method of birth control",
                "Know what increases the risk of yeast infections. Yeast infections, also called candidiasis, are increased by:[7]\n\nWearing tight underwear or non-cotton panties. These styles of panties can increase the temperature, the moisture levels and can be irritating.\nA weakened immune system\nUsing vaginal douches and/or perfumed feminine hygiene sprays\nVaginal trauma. This can be scratches in the vagina that occur during insertion of a tampon or other objects, or during rough sex.",
                "Understand how these vaginal infections can occur. These types of infections can occur because of a number of causes.\n\n\nIn BV, there is no specific cause, but it typically results from an imbalance of the normal bacterial populations.\nYeast infections can result after antibiotic use; the antibiotics kill off the normal bacterial populations, allowing the yeast to get a “foothold.” They can also come about as a complication of diabetes, or during hormonal changes, including a normal menstrual cycle or the use of birth control.",
                "Visit your doctor. It is important to get the correct diagnosis from a doctor before starting treatment. The treatments for the different forms of vaginal infections can be different, depending on the degree of infection.\n\n\nAt the doctor’s office, your physician will likely take a sample of the vaginal discharge, ask for a urine sample and perform a vaginal exam. This exam may be uncomfortable but it is usually over quickly. The discharge will be tested for the presence of bacteria, yeast or other organisms such as Trichomonas.\nIt’s important to get a specific diagnosis from your doctor. The approaches for treating vaginal infections differ depending on the type of infection.",
                "Know the risks of leaving an infection untreated. Untreated or incorrectly treated BV can result in complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pre-term births and low-birth weight babies and put a woman at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV ), chlamydia and gonorrhea.[8] Untreated or incorrectly treated Trichomonas infections can also lead to increased risk of HIV.[9]",
                "See your doctor immediately if you have severe symptoms. If you choose to only use natural remedies, make sure you call your physician if:[10]\n\nThere is no improvement in your symptoms after three days.\nYou develop a fever.\nYou experience difficulty or pain on urination.\nSexual activity is painful.\nYou have abdominal pain.\nThe amount or characteristic of the vaginal discharge increases or changes (such as changing odor or color).\nYou have a new rash that appears anywhere on your body.",
                "Tell your doctor you’re planning to use natural treatments. You should always get a diagnosis from your physician when you first start experiencing any of the symptoms. This is because some natural treatments work better for BV or candidiasis, and others may not work as well. You can also use these treatments along with the medications prescribed by your physician. They don’t interfere with oral antibiotics.\n\n\nTell your doctor that you are using these approaches. If you are successful, perhaps your physician can recommend the method to others.",
                "Warn sexual partners if you suspect you have trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is classified as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), so if you are diagnosed with trichomoniasis, you should inform any sexual partner so they can be treated as well. [11],[12]\n\nIf trichomoniasis is the diagnosis, then home remedies are not appropriate.",
                "Know the risks of douching. Douching is not generally recommended, because the vagina naturally cleans itself. But, it can be used sparingly when you have BV. You should know, however, that there is a risk of pushing the bacteria into your cervix and uterus and risk PID and other serious infections.\n\n\nDouching is actually believed by many physicians to increase the risk of BV.[13]",
                "Try a store-bought douche. Douching is the procedure of washing or cleaning out the inside of the vagina with water or other mixtures of fluids. You can buy prepackaged mixes for douching at most pharmacies and drug stores. These usually come in a bottle with a curved neck or a bag.\n\n\nStart by getting into the shower or bath. Most women find it easier to prop one leg on a surface like the edge of the tub. Be careful not to slip.\nThen, with one hand, spread the labia (the “lips” that are on either side of the vagina) and find the vaginal opening.\nHold the bottle or bag in the other hand.\nGently squirt the douche upward through the tube or nozzle into your vagina.\nThe mixture will come back out through your vagina.",
                "Mix apple cider vinegar with water for a douche. Apple cider vinegar is believed to restore the acidic pH of the vagina.[14] It can be used with relative effectiveness to get rid of BV.\n\n\nGet a douche kit from a drugstore. You will use the equipment that is included with the kit. Or, you can use an enema kit, which has the same equipment as a douche kit.\nMix two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm filtered water. Don’t use white vinegar, as this is too acidic.\nUse the douche twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. [15]",
                "Try a douche made from hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has disinfectant properties, and it can also get rid of irritants that can cause BV.[16]\n\nMix 3% hydrogen peroxide with an equal amount of warm distilled water and douche with this mixture. Use distilled water because the water should be sterile and bacteria-free.\nUse as a douche twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. [17]",
                "Use oregano essential oil and water as a douche. Use two to three drops of essential oregano oil in eight ounces of distilled water. Repeat twice a day for one week. Repeat twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. [18]\n\nFor yeast infections, try douching with two to three drops of essential tea tree oil in eight ounces of distilled water. Repeat twice a day for one week. Repeat twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. Never ingest tea tree oil. [19]\n\nYou can also apply two to three drops of the oil on a tampon and insert the tampon into your vagina. Leave it in for about one hour.\nDo not use essential oil treatments if you are pregnant, nursing, or expect to become pregnant in the immediate future.",
                "Try plain yogurt. It sounds messy, and it IS messy. But inserting yogurt into your vagina is a way of re-populating the vagina with harmless bacteria that may be able to “crowd out” the parasite. However, there are no scientific studies that indicate this. [20], [21], [22], [23]\n\nUse plain yogurt and a 10 mL syringe (you can buy this syringe at your local pharmacy).\nEvery night, fill the syringe with the plain yogurt and fill your vagina by inserting the syringe and depressing the plunger.\nGo to bed as usual, but wear a sanitary pad. The messiness comes in the morning when you get out of bed. You should also wear a thin pad during the day.\nRepeat every night until the symptoms disappear.\nYou can also use a tampon coated with yogurt, but tampons without the applicator can be difficult and uncomfortable to insert.",
                "Replenish good bacteria with a probiotic suppository. A probiotic will help replenish good bacteria in your body. [24], [25], [26]\n\nProbiotic capsules can be expensive and can be found in most groceries and drugstores. Use gelcap suppositories, since hard suppositories may not be as effective. Buy a brand that has Bifidobacterium longum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Bifidobacterium infantis; Lactobacillus acidophilus; or Lactobacillus reuteri HA-188.\nThere is not a lot of evidence showing if probiotics as a supplement or in yogurt are helpful in preventing trichomoniasis.",
                "Use periodontal gel. Use Curasept periodontal gel and apply in and around the vagina. Curasept contains 0.5% cyclohexadiene, a disinfectant which has been shown to be effective in treating BV.[27]",
                "Try a clove of garlic. A whole clove of peeled garlic can be inserted into the vagina and has been reported to be helpful in treating BV. .[28] This is because the garlic contains allicin, which is a natural antibiotic that fights BV.\n\n\nPeel a clove of garlic. Poke some holes in the garlic so that the allicin can be released. Insert the clove into your vagina. Replace the garlic every four hours for seven days or until symptoms have disappeared. [29]",
                "Treat a yeast infection with a boric acid suppository. Boric acid can be irritating, so you shouldn’t make your own suppository. Do not directly apply it to the vagina. Look for Vitanica Yeast Arrest, found in many health food stores. This product is specially formulated for vaginal yeast infections.[30]\n\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper usage.\nYou must not be the recipient of oral sex while using boric acid because boric acid is poisonous to your partner.",
                "Get an over-the-counter gel or cream. Most of the gels and creams for vaginal yeast infections that you can get over-the-counter are almost as effective as anti-fungal medications. Examples include Monistat and Gyne-Lotrimin. Use as directed. If you have recurrent infections, use for seven days.[31]",
                "See your doctor about recurring or long-lasting vaginal infections. If you keep getting vaginal infections, or your infection won't go away, make an appointment to see your doctor. Recurrent yeast infections can be a sign of a more serious underlying disorder such as diabetes, cancer or HIV-AIDs.[32]\n\nIf your symptoms don't clear up after three days, talk with your doctor about taking medication. You should also see your doctor if your symptoms return or worsen.\nYour doctor may prescribe an anti-fungal medication to suppress the infection. You will likely need to take this medication every week or month for six months to a year.[33]",
                "Take antibiotics for BV and trichomoniasis. Treatment will depend on the type of infection, how extensive or severe it is and how long you have had the infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for BV and for trichomoniasis, but they are not effective on yeast infections.\n\n\nBV is generally treated with either metronidazole or clindamycin. These are considered safe if you are pregnant.\n\nMale partners usually don’t need treatment, but female partners should be informed and tested.[34]\n\n\n\nTrichomoniasis is usually treated with a single dose of either metronidazole or tinidazole. These are considered safe if you are pregnant.[35]\nTrichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection, so make sure your sexual partner(s) are treated as well and wait for seven days after treatment to have sex.[36]",
                "Treat stubborn vaginal yeast infections with an anti-fungal cream. Vaginal yeast infections can be treated with anti-fungal creams, ointments and vaginal suppositories.\n\n\nExamples of these treatments are butoconazole (Gynazole-1), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), miconazole (Monistat 3) and terconazole (Terazol 3). Your doctor can prescribe them or they are available (in weaker doses) over-the-counter at your pharmacy.",
                "Treat a long-lasting yeast infection with fluconazole. Vaginal yeast infections can also be treated with a single oral dose of fluconazole (Diflucan). [37] Recurrent or more complicated yeast infections may be treated with higher doses of the medications or you may be asked to take them for a longer period of time.\n\n\nMost often, your partner won’t need treatment. However, this may change if you experience recurrent infections.[38]",
                "Use caution if you are pregnant. Pregnant women can experience yeast infections, which should be cleared up before the baby is due. If you still have a yeast infection when the baby is born, it can pass to the baby, causing thrush.[39]\n\nCheck with your doctor about treating vaginal infections during this time.",
                "Take oral probiotics to prevent BV. You can take probiotics by mouth (either as capsules or in yogurt). These are mainly useful for prevention rather than treatment of BV. If you are prone to BV, eat one serving of yogurt daily (about 150 grams) with four to give billion CFU (Colony Forming Units). Make sure to choose a yogurt that has this information on the label.\n\n\nYou can also take probiotic capsules according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Experts don’t know exactly how ingested bacterial cultures in yogurt or probiotic supplements can populate the vagina, but there is evidence that they do.[40]",
                "Wash your genital area gently. Use a very mild soap and warm water to wash your genital area. Dry yourself with a clean towel or allow yourself to air dry. You can also try drying it with a blow dryer set on cool.[41]\n\nAvoid scratching or rubbing your genitals. Keep irritation at a minimum by leaving your genitals alone. Don’t scratch or rub the area.",
                "Wear only white, 100% cotton underwear. Cotton allows your genital area to stay cool and dry. The white underwear avoids irritants that may be in different dyes. Avoid nylon, acetate and any synthetic fibers.\n\n\nAvoid wearing thong underwear because these tend to be irritating.",
                "Use a mild detergent for your underwear. Use a mild and fragrance free soap (such as fragrance-free Woolite) for washing your panties. Do not use fabric softeners or dryer sheets. These also contain chemicals that may irritate you.\n\n\nDouble-rinse your underwear to ensure that all detergent is gone. Detergent residue can cause irritation.",
                "Practice good habits with toileting. Use white, soft toilet tissue. Remember always to wipe from the front to the back to minimize the risk of infection from bowel bacteria.",
                "Use tampons during the day. Instead of using sanitary napkins while you have your period, use tampons during the day. Stay away from deodorant tampons because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome. Replace tampons every few hours, depending on your flow.\n\n\nDo not leave tampons in overnight. Use sanitary pads instead.",
                "Avoid wearing pantyhose. Pantyhose do not allow the genital area to “breathe.” They also trap heat and moisture, which creates the perfect setting for bacteria, yeast and other organisms. Instead, wear nylons with a cotton panty insert.",
                "Avoid irritating products. Avoid feminine hygiene products, which can irritate the vulva. These include deodorant sanitary pads, all feminine sprays and deodorants, any products containing Vaseline, oils or greases.\n\n\nAvoid bubble baths, bath oils, talc, or powder, especially powder that contains cornstarch. Cornstarch provides food for microorganisms.",
                "Treat vaginal infections after getting diagnosed. While some vaginal infections can be cured without the use of medications, it’s important to consult your OB/GYN or primary physician before beginning any treatment. Effective natural remedies may vary depending on the type of vaginal infection you have and the severity of the infection.\n\n\nSince some symptoms are common among multiple types of vaginal infections, self-diagnosis is both difficult and risky. An official diagnosis from your doctor is the only safe way to identify the type and degree of vaginal infection you have.\nTell your doctor if you have a strong preference for natural remedies. Some doctors are willing to work with you to accommodate this preference, and they should be able to guide you on which remedies would be best to try for your specific needs.\nNote that trichomoniasis is technically an STI. Natural remedies will not be sufficient to cure an infection caused by trichomoniasis; you will need medication to treat it.[42]",
                "Consider home treatment if you aren't pregnant or nursing. While many natural treatments are safe for women with BV or yeast infections, you should avoid most home treatments if you are currently pregnant or may become pregnant, or are currently breastfeeding. Some treatments can inadvertently harm your baby.\n\n\nThat being said, if you have a vaginal infection during pregnancy, you should still ask your doctor about treatment. Active yeast infections, in particular, can pass to your baby during birth and result in thrush.[43]",
                "Match the right treatment to the correct cause. Some treatments are only effective against certain causes of vaginal infection. To avoid possible complications, you should only try a natural remedy promoted for use against your type of infection; do not use a home remedy suggested for treatment against another type of vaginal infection unless instructed to do so by your doctor.\n\n\nAs a reminder, douching can be used sparingly if you have BV. It is not recommended for vaginal infections caused by yeast or trichomoniasis. Similarly, periodontal gel and garlic cloves should only be used for BV.\nOn the other hand, a yogurt suppository or probiotic suppository might be effective for both yeast and BV.[44]\n\nBoric acid suppositories are only recommended for use against yeast infections.",
                "Try natural remedies if you can limit or abstain from sexual activity during treatment. Abstaining from sexual activity may not be necessary for all treatments, but you should check with your doctor or do some thorough research to determine if the remedy you’ve chosen is safe to you and your partner before engaging in sexual activity during treatment.\n\n\nIn particular, exercise extreme caution when taking boric acid suppositories. Boric acid is toxic when ingested, making oral sex especially dangerous.[45]",
                "Use natural remedies while they continue to work. Natural home remedies can cure vaginal infections in some cases, but if your symptoms don’t respond to consistent treatment, contact your doctor again. It is possible that your type and degree of infection can only be cured with medication.\n\n\nVaginal infections—especially those caused by yeast—that won't go away or continually return may suggest a more serious underlying cause, including diabetes, cancer, or certain STIs. While this won't always be the case, it's important to rule out the possibility by asking your doctor to test you.[46]\n\nIf your symptoms worsen or do not improve after three days of treatment, contact your doctor.\nIt's important to completely get rid of your vaginal infection. If left untreated, you may suffer from future complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, an increased risk of pre-term deliveries, and an increased risk of contracting STIs.[47] Even if you think you cured your infection naturally, consider asking your doctor to re-test you to make sure."

        "How to Be Verbose": {
            "intro": "Being verbose is a poor method of communication, droning on in pompous persistence. While a bit of the old pleonasm is a terrible idea if you're trying to impress a potential employer, keeping a few recondite words at your disposal can be a splendid defense against the pedantry of others. If you want to turn off all your interlocutors, you can learn skills necessary to be long-winded, pompous, and overblown. Channel your Polonius and learn to be verbose.",
            "steps": [
                "Start speaking without a clear idea of where you’re going. Warren G. Harding, grandiloquent speaker and former President of the United States, had a speech style consisting primarily of “an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea,” according to one political critic. Emulate the verbosity of the 29th president of the Union.\n\n\nMany speakers start to trail off toward the end of a thought, pausing to take a breath and collect their thoughts. Instead, learn to end passages with openings into new passages, immediately saying, \"In other words,\" or \"Additionally,\" to keep your grip on the conversation firm.",
                "Use multitudinous, varied, and diverse adjectives. To say a writer or a speaker is verbose is to say that, for him, one accurate adjective could never accomplish what five so-so, mediocre, middling, half-cocked, wobbly adjectives could accomplish by piling them up in a heap. Verbosity means wordiness. Over-describe every single noun in your speech and you will be well on your way.\n\n\nDon't neglect adverbs. If a swan is swimming, it should be \"swiftly, gently swimming.\" Think of each sentence as a Christmas tree that you want to hang ornaments.[1]",
                "Over-explain yourself. Long-winded verbose speakers of the world never know when to quit. Never give up on proving your viewpoint, even if everyone in the room took your word for it twenty minutes ago.\n\n\nRestate every claim and position for ultimate rhetorical effect. Make friends with the phrase “in other words,\" rephrasing your positions in different language but with exactly the same meaning.\nRethink everything you put forward, hedging every claim and debating inwardly with yourself over your statements. When you get to the end of one point, train yourself to say, “On the other hand…” to open up an avenue for further chatter.",
                "Embrace digressions and asides. The mind of the verbose should be like a fish tank. Let each thought-fish go wherever it wants, then follow it there. Don't worry so much about where you're going with an argument, just worry about exploring every possible nook and cranny of a conversation before you let it drop.",
                "Read long-winded writers. While Shakespeare's Polonius might be the patron-saint of the pompous, if you want more art and less matter in your speech, learn from the masters of long-windedness, who actually manage to pull off extreme verbosity.[2] Check out the following writers of sentence-labyrinthes and pompous characters who never know when to quit:\n\n\nHerman Melville\nSusan Sontag\nSalvatore Scibona\nWilliam Faulkner\nVirginia Woolf\nSamuel Beckett",
                "Start actively gathering new words to use. Look for obscure word lists, sign up for word-a-day emails and never hesitate to look up a definition if you encounter an unfamiliar word.\n\n\nAfter a while, you may discover that you’ve come down with a nasty case of logolepsy (a love of words). If you look, you will find words that are easy to love. Take \"Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian\" as an example. This word, which means \"a word coined so as to be long\" is actually longer than its definition.",
                "Study the roots of words. By learning the roots of words, you can discern meanings of unfamiliar words more easily, helping you to build an infinite vocabulary. You will be able to create neologisms, or new words based on existing definitions.\n\n\nIf you know a substantial number of suffixes and prefixes, you can make up your own behemoth words. The Shakespearean gem \"Honorificabilitudinitatibus\" started with the simple root word of Honor.\nApply unconventional conjugations and parasynthesis (use odd tenses and variations). Sometimes a common word can be verbose if an unusual tense is applied. The word “datum” sounds particularly erudite when compared to the singular “data.”",
                "Use long words. Never use one syllable where three will do. In other words, eschew monosyllabic iterations when feasible.[3]\n\nIf your lexicon is archaic enough, you can add additional words by using synonymous adjectives. For example, you could describe a redundant speaker as being \"Tautologically loquacious,” which has a bit more juice than calling them \"Redundantly repetitive,” though it means, more or less, the same thing.\nTake the word 'hyperpolysyllabic' as your example. It means essentially the same thing if you leave the 'hyper' off, but why waste a perfectly good 17 letter word?",
                "Use words correctly. The goal of verbosity is to appear intelligent, not ridiculous. Using an obscure word incorrectly can be deleterious to the illusion of perspicacity. Be sure to check the usage of a new word in several sources before applying it in the real world. All the astute logorrhea in the world won't help you if you're caught saying \"Don't condensate me.\"",
                "Use heavy-handed metaphors. Verbosity also includes a certain measure of pomposity in the execution. If you want to be counted as a verbose speaker or writer, it helps to get lost in the deep water of an overblown (and mixed) metaphor. Every molehill should not only be a mountain, but a mountain on which hordes of philandering demon spawn forth fortnightly.",
                "Leave no streams in the torrent of words. If you want to run on for a long time, make sure you stitch your prose together ever tighter with gapless precision. In other words, don’t let anyone get a word in edgewise.\n\n\nLearn to anticipate the ends of your own sentences and start the next sentence before taking a breath.\nHook a reader in with a transitional phrase at the end of a long paragraph that will force us to read on, even if we’re bored to tears. Better yet, eschew paragraphing entirely and give no rest for the weary.",
                "Sprinkle your prose with phrases from multiple languages. The long-winded know one thing to be true: “Quidquid Latine dictum sit altum videtur” (Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound). Memorize a few good Latin phrases and insert these whenever you can. Mix in some French or Italian, overemphasizing the pronunciation, and you'll be pretentious in four languages.\n\n\nRather than saying, \"He makes a habit of using arcane references\", try \"His modus operandi seems to be obscurum per obscurius\" to give your volubility a bit of international flavor.",
                "Interrupt other speakers. If you have a question as to whether or not the floor is yours, it is. Take control of every conversation and don't let go of the talking stick until you've chattered everyone else into submission. Quell dissent like Ross Perot used to: constantly referring to how often you yourself are interrupted. \"Can I finish? Can I get a word in please?\"\n\n\nIgnore body language and other nonverbal clues that indicate someone else would like to speak. Keep your gaze focused off in the middle-distance as you recount the sea-faring voyages of your childhood. Ignore the snores at the table around you."

        "How to Gel Your Hair": {
            "intro": "Hair gel is one of the oldest styling products around, and can be used to create styles that range from slicked-back to messy and spiky. Applying gel isn't difficult, when you have your ideal hair style in mind. Whether you're simply trying to tame your frizz, or you want to have a particularly dashing look for your next formal event, hair gel may become your new best friend.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose the right gel. Hair gels are usually categorized by the thickness of the compound and the power of the hold. The color and the scent of hair gels generally doesn't make any difference in terms of how they work. Most gels are applied with the fingertips, but there are a few which are spray-on. Decide which is best for your style, or try out each one and see which you prefer.\n\n\nA light, foamy gel is effective in creating a playful, messy look. You'll still be able to have some bounce and some life in your hair.\nA medium-hold gel is great for shiny spikes, getting your hair to stay in almost gravity-defying ways.\nA thick gel will give you a slicked-back look, holding it in place firmly all day. You might not be able to run your fingers through it, but it'll hold fast in a windstorm.",
                "Wash your hair to get started. Starting with a solid foundation of clean hair will make creating your gelled style much easier. Shampoo and condition your hair as per normal, and then use a towel to dry it until damp. It’s important to have damp hair when you apply gel, so don’t dry it thoroughly. If you’re short on time, dampening your hair in the sink is also a good option.[1]\n\nApplying gel to dirty or greasy hair can make the gel less affective and more \"crunchy\" looking. It also promotes split ends and poor hair health, so it's always a good idea to give your hair a thorough washing first.",
                "Scoop out some of the gel. Put a small dab of hair gel onto your fingertips and rub your hands together to coat your hands evenly and rub it into your hair, as if it were shampoo. Depending on how thick and long your hair is, you'll need to use an appropriate amount of be sure to spread it evenly across your fingertips. Remember, you can always add more, but it's hard to get hair gel out of your hair without rewashing, so go easy:\n\nUse a dime-sized amount for short hair.\nUse a quarter-sized amount for medium-length hair.\nUse two or more quarter-sized amounts for long (or especially thick) hair.",
                "Apply the gel. Style your hair according to the look you’re going for (as aforementioned). Generally, you should start with the gel just above your hairline, and work it back towards the crown of your head/nape of your neck. Use your fingers to apply the gel, and if desired, use a comb to better incorporate the gel afterwards.\n\nFor a straight-haired look, brush or shape hair to your desired style.\n\nScrunch or twist your hair with your fingers to encourage curls.\nTo give curly or wavy hair extra volume, especially at the roots, flip your head over to scrunch the gel in evenly.",
                "Complete your style. Most hair gels contain alcohol which allows them to dry quickly. If yours does not, you’ll need to wait a few minutes for the gel to set. You can manipulate the gel while it’s wet, but once it dries it will become stiff and firm. When the gel has set, your look is finished and you’re ready to show off your new hair![2]",
                "Try a messy and informal look. Gel is the best go-to hair product for creating that messy-yet-sophisticated look with your hair. This is great for days when you want to look casual yet put-together, and don’t have much time to style your hair.\n\nTo create this look, spread the gel through your hair using only your fingertips, moving strands in different directions and taming fly-aways.\nThe best gel for this type of look would be a lighter gel, and the best type of hair would be medium-length hair of moderate thickness.",
                "Try a simple part. If you don’t want to spend a lot of time on your hair and are just looking for a way to keep it in place, gel is a good option. The idea with this style is that you make your hair look as natural as possible, parting it along it's natural line, but without risking frizz and a cowlick as the day goes on that would come from simply combing.\n\nPut a very small amount of gel in your hands, and finger-style your hair, pulling it down the side of your head along the part, in opposite directions.\nTake a comb and dampen it slightly under the water, then comb along the hair in the direction you started, if you want it to look slightly neater.\nThis type of look is best with thinner hair of moderate or short length, but is also perfectly useful for all types of hair. It can be an effective style for masking a receding hairline, as well.",
                "Go for a classic slicked-back look. Few things are as sophisticated as a slicked-back hair style reminiscent of Don Draper, Pat Riley, or Jay Gatsby. This type of hairstyle looks classy and simple. This look is best for special occasions and formal settings, and can be achieved with a heavy amount of gel and a fine-tooth comb.\n\nSpread the gel through your hair, sweeping your hair from the line of your forehead toward the back of your head, without parting it. Use the damp comb to sweep it into place as neatly and flatly as possible.\nThis type of look works best with medium-longish hair of moderate thickness. It can emphasize a receding hairline, so be cautious if things aren't quite as thick up there as they used to be.",
                "Try spiking your hair. If you’ve always dreamt of rockstar spiked hair, you can easily recreate the look with some of your favorite hair gel. Although this style is generally only appropriate for casual settings (don't wear it on a first date) it can be a fun change of pace.\n\nUse a dollop of gel on your fingertips, and spread it upwards through your hair, pulling your hair away from your head and pinching it in between your fingers to create spikes. For a milder look, you can do this only to the front portion of your hair.[3]\n\nWait a few minutes and the let the initial spikes dry, then get a very tiny amount of gel on your fingertips and go back through, strengthening the spikes and building them up slightly, if you want to really emphasize them.\nThis style looks best with medium-length hair of moderate thickness. If it's too long, you'll probably need to use hair spray (and maybe even egg whites) in conjunction with the gel to get things to stay in place.",
                "Try a pompadour. You know you want to. Channel your inner Elvis Presley and Conan O'Brien with this almost over-the-top rockabilly style. It's maybe the most challenging to style and to pull off, but it's basically a combination of some of the above techniques. Even if you just try it while you're sitting around the house one day, it's something to cross off the bucket list.\n\nPut a liberal amount of gel into your fingertips and do a basic mussed-up look, getting your hair into a combination of spikes and casual messiness. Then, take a medium-tooth comb, wet it, and run it along the sides of your head, above each ear.\nIf you want a more formal pompadour, you can do a neat part along your natural hairline to one side with the comb, keeping it straight, then do the same straight-back action with the comb on both sides. You might need to use your fingers to get the front tips up as high as you want.\nThis works best for hair that's longish on top and quite short, or even buzzed, on the sides."

        "How to Live Happily Ever After": {
            "intro": "The authors of fairy tales would have us believe that living happily ever after is par for the course. In reality we know that life is a balance of both happiness and the opposite — feelings like sadness, boredom and lack of contentment — but there are things you can do to increase the happiness factor in your relationships, at work and on a personal level. Having realistic expectations, a forgiving spirit and the ability to be optimistic are all qualities that can help you attain your unique version of living the dream.",
            "steps": [
                "Love the whole person, flaws and all. When you make a commitment to someone, you have to be willing to accept their limitations as well as their good qualities. While you might find it irritating that your partner is awkward at parties or doesn’t know how to fry an egg, don’t commit to a relationship expecting these things to change. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t, but if your expectations don’t match reality, you’re likely to end up disappointed.\n\n\nTrying to change your partner will result in a lot of fighting. You might even end up hurting his or her self-esteem.\nRealize that love means accepting a person for who he or she is, and getting the same acceptance in return. Instead of focusing on what you wish would change, be grateful you found someone who accepts ‘’your’’ flaws, too.",
                "Drop the fairy tale mentality. Research shows that people who believe that romantic love resembles the Cinderella story have a harder time facing the reality of relationships.[1] As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, \"Happiness isn't a goal, it's a by-product.\" If you expect to find a lover that will fill you with overwhelming ebullience every time you gaze in their eyes, odds are pretty high that you will be disappointed. Talk to your partner about what makes you happy and learn what makes your partner happy as well.\n\n\nRealize that the Disneyfied version of life is fun to watch in the movies, but it doesn’t bear much resemblance to real life. Real life stretches past the glorious wedding day and into a future filled with stress and hardships to balance out the bliss.\nRelationships can feel magical. However, they don't actually operate on magic and serendipity, but on hard work, especially after the first few years.",
                "Keep the passion alive by surprising each other. That initial flame might die down a little after a few years of washing each other’s dirty dishes, but that doesn’t mean it has to completely go out. Research shows that surprising each other by picking up new hobbies, trying new things together, and just generally embracing newness helps a couple stay interested in one another. When you surprise each other, you get a taste of those butterflies you felt on your first few dates.[2]\n\nHaving pleasant date night activities is fine, but loses out to activities that are new and different.\nDon't despair at the thought that the passion you felt when you first met won't last forever. Many couples find that they appreciate the deepened trust and companionship that's earned only after years of dealing with life's ups and downs as a team more than the excitement of love's first sparks.",
                "Be willing to put in effort to keep the relationship strong. Every couple faces hardships: job loss, the illness and death of family members, the trials of having kids, financial duress. All of these situations can put a lot of stress on a relationship. When your relationship hits hurdles, making an effort to get through them will enable you to emerge stronger than ever. Even if you strongly disagree with your partner, don’t let your underlying love and regard for the person waver.\n\n\nResearch shows that couples who resort to throwing insults during fights end up causing permanent damage to the relationship.[3]\n\nInstead, fight in a loving way; argue about the issue at hand, instead of personally attacking your partner’s intelligence or abilities.",
                "Make sure you're compatible. This can be tricky because no relationship is perfect and they all require work, but it is entirely possible that you're in a relationship that would require more work than finding a new partner. It can be hard to take an objective look at something so personal, so use a few objective measures of compatibility:\n\n\nFaith: It can be extraordinarily difficult to make a relationship work if you don't share the same basic values. This isn't to say that people of divergent faiths can't be happy together, but that they will usually have to work a lot harder at it.\nPolitics: Our political beliefs are usually an extension of much deeper core values so differences in political beliefs often indicate fundamental differences in the way that we perceive the world.\nSocial: If one half of the relationship likes to go out every night and the other half would prefer to curl up with a good book, it'll be much harder to find the mutual interests that will sustain your relationship.\nFinancial: It's said that as many as half of divorces are rooted in arguments that stem from finances. If one half of the relationship is determined to be a multimillionaire while the other would be happy with a modest house and plenty of time to hike, this will likely be a source for conflict later.",
                "Don't get addicted to the past. All too often people say things like \"We don't talk like we used to,\" or \"He's just not like the man I married\". In a long relationship, you have to be prepared for your partner to grow and mature. We continue to mature throughout our lives and you can't expect somebody to act the same way they did a decade ago any more than you can realistically expect them to look the same as they did a decade ago. Instead of focusing on the things you did together in the past, examine the people that you've become and focus on the things you will do together in the future.",
                "Don’t depend on a partner for happiness. Being in a relationship can increase people’s happiness, but it can also be a source of sadness. You can have a happy life as a single person, too. Don’t buy into the idea that the only way to live happily ever after is with a prince or princess, especially if you know deep down that something isn’t right.",
                "Invest in people instead of things. Research shows that spending time with loved ones makes people happier than focusing too much energy on acquiring money, power and possessions.[4] When it comes to making big life decisions, consider that arranging your life to be more family-focused may make you feel happier in the long run.\n\n\nLook for ways to spend more time with friends and family. Schedule it in if you have to so you get in the practice of seeing people more often.\nRemember that close friends are just as important as family. If your biological family is dysfunctional or hostile, you can still find happiness by spending time with your best friends.\nGiving back to strangers also helps to boost happiness. Find a way to help people each week by volunteering in your community.",
                "Appreciate what you have. You’ve heard it before, but this is a very important way to increase your happiness. If you're a \"grass is greener\" person, you're hurting your chances at happiness. Think about times when you made the choice to switch jobs or move cities, only to realize that the grass has brown spots no matter where you land. Instead of wishing for something different, focus on loving what you have.\n\n\nMake a list of things you’re grateful for. Writing it all out can help you realize just how much you have going for you. Post the list in a place where you'll be reminded of the good things in your life every day. [5]\n\nIf you have trouble finding things to write down, find ways to add more positive elements to your life. Go out of your way to make a new friend, or learn a skill that brings you pleasure. Cultivate the positive and don’t dwell on the negative.",
                "Don’t hold grudges. If you carry anger around with you everywhere you go, realize it’s affecting you much more than it’s affecting the subject of your ire. Even if you have a very good reason to feel angry and bitter, holding a grudge isn't going to make you feel better. If there’s nothing you can change about the situation, let it go, no matter how hard that might be. You’ll be a much happier person for it.\n\n\nBe a more forgiving and open person.[6] Try to let small things like negative comments roll off your back instead of dwelling on them.\nLet go of feelings like envy and jealousy as well. You can’t control other people, but you can control your reactions to situations you face. While the occasional bout of negative feelings is inevitable, keeping them stored up inside you for long periods of time is going to get you down.",
                "Surround yourself with people who are happy. Emotions are infectious. If your friends are dreary and negative, it’s going to be hard to stay happy around them. That’s not to say you should ditch your friends, but it’s important to find people who make you feel light and happy, too.\n\n\nIf there's a person in your life who tends to make you feel bad more often than good, consider having a frank conversation about the problem. If that doesn't work, it's OK to give yourself permission to end the relationship, for the sake of your own health and happiness.",
                "Make sure your job is working for you. Not everyone gets to make a living doing what they’re most passionate about, and even those who do have job dissatisfaction sometimes. When it comes to your work, the important thing is that you feel as though you respect your employer, your work is worthwhile and you’re getting adequate credit for your efforts.\n\n\nEven if it’s not your dream job, you can still be content. Your work, like other areas in your life, is not going to be perfect. Take the negative with the positive and learn what you can live with and what you can’t, and make changes if necessary.\nIf you’re having trouble finding work that meets your needs, consider seeking career counseling.",
                "Spend time outside. Studies show that spending time outside, even just 20 minutes a day, increases happiness.[7] The time you spend walking in the park or laying out on the beach is absolutely essential for good mental health, so stop thinking of outside time as a luxury. It's a necessity.\n\n\nIf you’re not used to spending time outside, since you're so busy with other things, make it a priority. Schedule in a walk before or after work or school, or plan to spend the evening outside in the backyard.\nTry to find a place to spend time in a natural setting; a city street isn’t going to have the same effect as a park.",
                "Move closer to your job. Studies show that people with long commutes are less happy than those who live close to work.[8] The discrepancy is so pronounced that it might be worthwhile to take a job that’s less prestigious and well paying in order to have a shorter trip to work. This is a specific way you can increase your happiness, if you're brave enough to make the leap.\n\n\nSpending less time commuting gives you more time to do things like hang out with your family, cook a good meal, or go for a walk outside. All of these activities lead to decreased stress and increased happiness.",
                "Get better sleep. When you don’t get adequate sleep at night, you’re more sensitive to negative emotions. A comment you might normally let roll off your back might flare up into a bout of tears or a panic attack. Aim to get seven to eight hours of sleep every night for best results. You'll feel refreshed and better able to tackle whatever issues come your way throughout the day.",
                "Exercise regularly. Exercising your body releases endorphins that physically change your mood and make you feel happier. Doing it every day simply increases this effect. If you think you hate exercise, work up to it in small increments. Aim to get 30 minutes to an hour of exercise, even just walking, every day.\n\n\nExercise also leads to a boost in self-esteem and helps you feel more in touch with your body's capabilities.\nExercise is so effective at increasing happiness that it's an effective treatment for depression.[9]"

        "How to Skateboard": {
            "intro": "Skateboarding is one of the most popular and iconic street sports. Whether you want to learn the basics to cruise around, or you want to learn to kickflip like a pro, you can learn what you need to get started. From buying your first board to nailing an Ollie you can learn what it takes to surf the sidewalk.",
            "steps": [
                "Find a board appropriate for your interests. Skateboards can be cheap or expensive and come in a variety of sizes and styles. The two most basic are regular classic skateboards and longboards. Visit your local skate shop or a skating website to check out some affordable options.\n\n\nClassic skateboards have curved noses and tails, and have a concave to help with tricks. They come in a variety of sizes, and most are about 31\" or 30 in length long and 8\" wide. These are the boards to buy if you want to skate at the skatepark or on the street and to do tricks, eventually.\n\nLongboards or cruisers have a longer and flatter body. The length of the board varies, but they can be up to twice as long as a classic skateboard, making them much more stable and rideable for beginners. You can't really do tricks, but if you're interested in skating as a way of getting around or bombing hills, it's a great option.\nA beginner skateboard should cost between $50-$150. Try to have your board set up for you at the skate-shop with the right kinds of trucks and wheels for what you'll be doing. Just remember, NEVER buy a Walmart or Toys R Us board. They will snap quickly and are hard to learn on. Go to a real skate shop.",
                "Get some appropriate footwear. Skate shoes are typically sold by brands such as Vans, Airwalk, Converse, or Etnies. They have sturdy sides and flat bottoms, perfect for gripping the board. While you can always skate with regular sneakers, it's a lot easier to maneuver around the board with skate shoes.\n\n\nNever try to skate in sandals or flip-flops. You need to be able to move your feet around easily and feel comfortable. Without these, you can hurt your ankle easily and are a lot more likely to fall.",
                "Get the appropriate safety gear. When you're first starting out learning to skate, you're going to fall down. Probably a lot. Consider investing in safety equipment such as a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads to protect you from falls and accidents. This is especially important for beginners. Some states, like California, require all skaters to wear helmets on the street.[1]\n\nMake sure to get a helmet that fits your head properly. Before you go to the store, use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head, just above your eyebrows, in a straight line around your skull. Buy a helmet that fits snugly.\nThere's nothing lame/childish about pads. It's important to protect yourself from serious head injuries.",
                "Find a good place to skate. A level, concrete driveway or parking lot is a good place to start getting comfortable on the board. Make sure there isn't anything in your way and be wary of cracks, loose stones and potholes. Running over a little pebble can account for a whole lot of crashes, especially with hard wheels.\n\n\nSkateparks are great places to skate once you've got some experience. If you're just trying to get the board to stay under you without falling down, parks might be a little intense. If there's one in your area, go watch some skaters for tips, but stay on the sidelines.",
                "Consider getting someone you know that's good at skateboarding to teach you. Your dad probably can't shove it or anything, so ask someone from a local shop or park if you can watch them. Bring some beginners and ask if what he's doing is intermediate to advanced skating, if it is, perfect. You have a teacher.\n\n\nSkating with friends is a big part of what skating is all about. If you've got some skater friends, get help learning from them. Learning from friends is infinitely better than learning on your own or on the internet.",
                "Stand on the board properly. Put the board flat on the ground and stand on it to learn to place your feet properly, and get your balance without falling down. Stand with your feet angled sideways on the board, your feet lined up roughly with the truck screws that attach the wheels to the board.\n\n\nRegular foot means that you've got your left foot forward and your right foot in the rear. This usually means that you'll use your right foot to push.\nGoofy foot means that you've got your right foot forward and left in the rear. Usually, this means you'll use your left foot to push.\nRock back and forth a little to see how the wheels move and how much sway you've got on the trucks. Just get comfortable.",
                "Try pushing off very gently and placing your feet on the board. Turn your front foot slightly so it's more straight with the board, instead of sideways on the board. Use your other foot to gently push off, going very slowly at first. You don't want to have an accident just because you were going too fast before you were ready.\n\n\nAfter you get some momentum, practice putting your back foot into place on the back of the board, just ahead of the tail curl, around the trucks. Get your balance and ride, bending your knees some to keep your balance.\nMongo foot means that you feel more comfortable pushing off with your lead foot, and riding with your back foot. Some people see it as acceptable, but it will hinder you later and it's an awkward motion to swing your front foot around. If you find yourself pushing mongo, try switching from regular to goofy or vice-versa.",
                "Give yourself another push when you slow down. Keep practicing, making little push-offs, and pivoting your feet to ride on the board until you slow down. Then pivot your riding foot straight, push off with your other foot, and pivot back. The more you do this, the more comfortable you'll become at riding the board.\n\n\nTry speeding up, but just a little. Like a bike, some riders find it actually quite a bit easier to keep your balance when you're moving a little quicker.\nIf you start speed-wobbling, you can tighten your trucks. This will make it harder to turn but you can practice with tight trucks until you get your speed wobble under control. Shifting your weight forward usually helps.",
                "Flex your ankles and shift your weight to turn. Once you've got the hang of pushing off and riding some, try turning the board gently by shifting your weight. Ride with your knees flexed, keeping your center of gravity low to the ground. Then, shift your weight forward some to turn right (if you're riding regular foot), and rotate your ankles back to turn the board left.\n\n\nDepending on how loose your trucks are, you may have to only shift your weight very gently, or really bend into it. You can loosen your trucks by turning the large bolt in the center of each truck (lefty loosy, righty tighty). This puts more (tight) or less (loose) pressure on the bushings and makes turning easier (loose) or harder (tight).\nIf you have trouble balancing or falling while turning, shift your upper-body weight in the opposite direction. What really matters is that your feet pivot the deck so the trucks do the turning.",
                "Put your foot down to stop. To stop, you can simply put your pushing foot down when you've slowed down some, and halt your momentum. However, don't just jam your foot down hard at a fast speed. Start by dragging lightly and drag harder when you're going slow. Keep your riding foot on the board, or it'll just keep going.\n\n\nYou can also shift your weight back and scrape the tail against the ground if you want to stop. Some longboards have built-in plastic \"brake\" pads along the back lip of the board, while others won't. This is usually a bit more difficult, and will scrape away at the back of the board. An alternative that won't damage your board is to put your heel behind with your toes still on the tail when you do this. Your heel will drag on the ground instead of the tail.",
                "Try riding switch. Once you get very comfortable just riding your board, try switching around and riding with your back foot in front and your front foot in back. If you want to be a really good skater, you'll learn to skate equally comfortably from both directions, if you get switched around for a trick. This comes in handy when you try a half-pipe, or any number of different types of skateboarding tricks.",
                "Learn to fall properly. All skaters fall early and often. It's a part of skateboarding. It's important to wear the proper safety gear at all times, and learn to fall properly. To keep yourself from getting injured more seriously than the regular scrapes and bruises that are the skaters calling card, you can learn a few little tricks to keep yourself safe.\n\n\nPut your arms out, but keep them loose. If you're very rigid, you risk breaking wrists and ankles more seriously than if you use them to cushion your fall.[2]\n\nRoll out any time that you fall. You might scrape yourself up, but it'll hurt a lot less than if you're landing with a splat.\nBail out if you see something going bad. If you're going too fast and can't control your board, just jump off and land on your feet, or roll into the grass. Don't stick on a board that you've lost control of.",
                "Watch more experienced skaters to learn tips and tricks. Find some other skaters to skate with. It helps you to learn from their styles or different skill levels. If you don't know anyone, just talk to some other skaters at the local skate park. They are usually friendly, and will help you out. Experiment, make a higher ollie, read about how to do another trick, whatever your heart desires. Your teacher is more a friend than an instructor now, share skills with him, and anyone else you want to show off to.\n\n\nFor tips on how to do the moves, you can always watch a move in a video in slow motion and pay attention to the foot movement. Sequential photos are another great way to learn.\nThe more you practice, the better you will be. Don't get discouraged because you can't land a trick the first or second try. Just practice and have fun, and you will get the trick eventually.",
                "Start by popping the front up with your back foot on the tail. An ollie involves popping the board up into the air and landing on it safely. The first part of this trick is to get comfortable shifting your back foot for the tail of the board to hit the ground, so you can pop it up and into the air. Get used to this motion, it can't be stressed enough.\n\n\nAs you stand on the board, practice rocking back, popping the nose up into the air and staying balanced. You can even try it in motion if you work up the nerve.\nBefore you even try the first motion of an ollie, it might be a good idea to just stand beside the skateboard and practice popping it up into the air. Use your foot to stomp on the tail and see how much pressure it takes to pop it up in the air. This is also useful to pop it up to your hands and pick it up easily.",
                "Try to pop up the board while you're stationary. Stand on the board and flex your knees quite low, shifting your center of gravity down over the trucks. Shift your back foot back so it's on the tail. Pop the tail back, as you would while you're doing a manual, except all the way to the ground. Then pop it up into the ollie.\n\n\nDon't start in motion just yet. Before you can nail an ollie on the ground, it's quite dangerous to try one while you're skating. You'll probably wipe out.",
                "Pop the board up into the air and jump. To get the board to pop, you want to simultaneously slide your front foot backward just a little and leap into the air, bringing your knees up to your chest, while you stab down on the tail with your back foot.\n\n\nThis needs to be done in one swift motion, and it's somewhat difficult to get the hang of at first. You want to jump up into the air and off the board at the same time as you pop down with your back foot.[3]\n\nYou'll leap with your front foot just a little before you leap with your back foot. Imagine you're running sideways and trying to jump over a cone. You want to do that kind of motion.",
                "Drag your front foot forward to catch the board. After the board pops up in the air, drag your front foot forward to flatten the board back out and keep it under control. You'll need to start doing this pretty much as soon as you jump into the air.",
                "Push the board down by straightening your legs out. After you've straightened the board, push it back to the ground by straightening your legs and landing on the board in riding position. The most important thing to remember is to land with your feet over the bolts and knees bent, this improves your chances of rolling away successfully and keeps the board from breaking as often, as well as avoiding injury.\n\n\nNo shame in bailing out. If the board hasn't stayed straight, or it just doesn't feel right, don't try to land on it. Land on your feet instead.\nIn fact, it's probably a good idea to practice your first ollie by just jumping off the board and landing beside it.",
                "Try an ollie in motion. Once you can land ten stationary ollies in a row, try doing one in motion. Push off and start skating at a low to moderate speed, then crouch down and pop the board up just as you would when you're standing still.\n\n\nThis is the fundamental skill to learn, which most other popping style tricks are based on. For more information and links to specific trick articles, check out the next section.",
                "Try a pop shove it. Do an ollie as high as you can, then as you level off your feet, give a nudge with the front foot on the board so it spins 180 degrees. You may want to use a little \"scoop\" motion with the back foot to make it spin easier.",
                "Try a kick-flip. Do the same thing as a pop shove it, except when you nudge the board, kick the little area where the side of the board rises. Try out a few different motions until you get it to spin. This is not an easy trick, so practice and don't give up.",
                "Try to grind. Start with a fairly low rail (equal to or less than one foot.) This is not easy, so take it in steps.\n\n\nStart out simply rolling up to the rail, then jump off of your board and land with just your feet on the rail, letting the board roll away.\nNext, practice popping the board up as you jump, but don't worry about where it goes after that. Just make sure that your feet land on the rail.\nMake sure you roll up to the rail at a slight angle, not completely straight. This way, there's less risk of one truck getting caught on the start of the rail.\nNow it's time for the real thing. Ollie as high as you can, in the direction of the rail. Land with your feet on the bolts and the board balanced on the rail.\nIf the deck is sliding sideways on the rail, it's a board-slide. If you stay in the direction of the rail so your trucks lock in and grind it, it's a 50-50 grind.\nOnce you get to the end of the rail, turn the board around if you're in a board-slide (so it faces the right direction) and land over the bolts. If you're doing a 50-50 grind, lift the front wheels slightly (by pushing on the tail, again slightly) to the front of the board doesn't plummet down. An alternative is to ollie off.",
                "Head to the skatepark and learn to drop in. Dropping in takes guts, but it's worth it.\n\n\nStart with your tail on the coping (the metal on the top of the half-pipe) and your foot just behind the bolts, but far enough back to balance.\nPut your front foot over the bolts, and slam the board down. Don't hesitate, or you will fall. It takes confidence and power.\nBe sure to lean forward in this motion. If you don't, the board will slide out from under you. Your shoulders should always be parallel to the board.\nDon't worry about coming down on the other side, just hop off of your board at the top.",
                "Do some lip-tricks. Some good ones are a Rock to Fakie, Axle Stall, and Nose Stall. These look impressive, but are not that difficult to learn if you have several months of experience. When you go to the skatepark always be aware so you don't get hit. Trust me it hurts."

                "Treat sleep apnea conservatively. Sleep apnea is treated a number of different ways in addition to weight loss recommendations. Those diagnosed with sleep apnea should avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and sleep deprivation. Simple nasal sprays and saline solution rinses can help clear nasal passages as well.[5]",
                "Undergo mechanical therapy for sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first treatment that people who are suffering from sleep apnea undergo. CPAP outlines that patients must wear a mask that forces air through the nose and mouth while sleeping. The idea is to have the right amount of air pressure filtering through the air passages to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing as you sleep.",
                "Use a mandibular advancement device. These devices prevent the tongue from collapsing into the throat airway and can advance the lower jaw to open an airway further.",
                "Resort to surgery. People who have obstructive tissue such as a deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, or an over-sized tongue can be good candidates for various surgical procedures.\n\n\n\nSomnoplasty uses radio frequency to constrict the soft palate at the back of the throat and open the airway.\n'Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty' (surgical procedure), or UPPP/UP3, can remove soft tissue in the back of the throat surgically to open the airway.\n\nNasal surgery consists of several procedures that can fix obstructions or deformities like deviated septums.\n\nA tonsillectomy can remove oversized tonsils that are obstructing your airway.\n\nMandibular/maxillary advancement surgery consists of moving the jawbone forward to create space in the throat. This is a rather intense procedure that is reserved for only the worst cases of sleep apnea.[6]"

        "wikiHow to Treat Stomach Ulcers in Horses": {
            "intro": "While horses may look big and strong, they actually have rather sensitive stomachs. In particular, horses are prone to developing stomach ulcers. This article explains what causes ulcers, the symptoms, and the treatments dedicated to treating ulcers.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid things that cause ulcers. Diet, exercise, and lifestyle all play factors in whether or not a horse will develop an ulcer. A horse’s stomach is split into two parts--the the non-glandular part which immediately follows the esophagus, and the glandular part, which secretes enzymes like pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The glandular part is coated with mucus and bicarbonates, which protect it from the effects of hydrochloric acid or in common terms Muriatic acid! (Imagine drinking Muriatic acid). The ulceration of the non-glandular part of the stomach is the most common type of ulcer because it does not have the same protective lining as the glandular part. Causes of ulcers include:[citation needed]\n\nProlonged feeding of concentrates.\nProlonged starvation and low frequency of feeding (feeding only 3x/day).\nStress like prolonged and high intensity exercise, prolonged or frequent transport, prolonged confinement, depression, and no socialization with other horses.\nProlonged use of NSAIDS (Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs). These drugs block the production of chemicals in the stomach that inhibit acid production.\nStarvation in foals caused by poor mothering mares that lead delayed or infrequent milk suckling.",
                "Look for signs of stomach ulcers in foals. Foals may exhibit different symptoms than those of adult horses. Stomach ulcers are very prevalent in foals who have not suckled milk properly and they can actually lead to death. If you notice any of these symptoms, bring your foal to a horse veterinarian immediately. In particular, look for:[citation needed]\n\nColic or extreme abdominal pain\nTeeth grinding or bruxism\nExcess salivation\nDiarrhea\nPoor appetite\nEmaciation or poor body condition\nAttempting to lie on his back",
                "Look for symptoms of stomach ulcers in adult horses. Some of the symptoms that foals exhibit may also become apparent in adult horses. Whenever you observe these clinical signs you should suspect stomach ulcer, and immediately consult or bring your horse to a horse veterinarian. They can diagnose it definitively using an endoscope (a device that can see the inside of the horse stomach) and give proper treatment and advice. Look for:[citation needed]\n\nPoor appetite\nPoor body condition\nWeight loss\nMild colic\nMental dullness\nAttitude changes\nPoor performance\nLying down on back more than usual",
                "Rest the horse for a week. This will ensure that no reflux of acid will reach the non-glandular part of the stomach. During exercise and training, a lot of acids are refluxed, because exercise puts pressure on the stomach. Rapid movement that occurs during training can also cause acids in the stomach to splash. The stomach contains rapidly dividing cells. Resting the horse will ensure that the damaged lining will be repaired.",
                "Place the horse in a stall and make sure that his hay bin is always full. Horse stomachs secrete acid in a cyclical fashion. This means that the acidity will increase and decrease throughout the day--sometimes a horse’s stomach will have a pH of 5 or it can drop to as low as a pH of 1. When a horse has hay 24/7, his stomach will always be full. Hay causes the horse to chew more, thus creating more saliva; saliva protects against strong acids.\n\n\nThe chewed hay will float in the horse’s stomach and will form a protective layer that prevents the reflux of acids into the non-glandular part of the stomach.\nRoughage like alfalfa hay, for example, contain a lot of substances that act as antacids like calcium, magnesium sulfate, saponins, and mucilage proteins.",
                "Feed your horse before letting him exercise. After you have let your horse rest for a week, you can begin to reintroduce him to exercise. Thirty minutes before the exercise, feed him small amounts of alfalfa hay or 500 grams of alfalfa chaff. The alfalfa will create an alkaline layer that blocks acid splashing into the upper non-glandular section of the stomach.",
                "Give your horse proton-pump inhibitors. These drugs cause complete blocking of acid production, which in turn lets the stomach heal itself. These drugs are more potent than others and are generally given to the horse once a day.\n\n\nOmeprazole and pantoprazole are both proton-pump inhibitors. Omeprazole (dose at 0.7mg to 1.4mg/kg daily), is the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. Commercially available paste of omeprazole can be given once a day, and during transport.",
                "Give your horse histamine Type 2 (H2) receptor Blockers. These drugs cause partial blockage of acid production in the stomach, hence it is given more frequently. In general, you should give your horse this medication three or four times a day.\n\n\nCimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are variations of this medication. Dose of cimetidine (300 to 600mg 3 to 4 times a day). Ranitidine is effective in foals and is given once a day.",
                "Try giving your horse protective coatings. These drugs provide a protective lining in the stomach mucosa and aid in its healing process. There are two main kinds of prescribed protective lining, sucralfate and lecithin.\n\n\nSucralfate: this drug binds to the stomach mucosa and may promote healing. Dose for foals (1 to 2 grams in foals 4x a day), in horses (2mg/kg 2x a day).\nLecithin: contains phospholipids and essential fatty acids like linolenic acid (omega 6), and linoleic acid (omega 3). Lecithin binds to the lipid layer of the stomach, providing an additional layer of protections against acids, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids strengthens the cell membranes of the stomach lining.",
                "Try other substances that promote protective lining growth. Other substances that give a protective layer in the stomach include slippery elm powder, low protein whey powder, and psyllium husk. These substances can be given as slurry before feeding, or as top dressing in dry feed.",
                "Give your horse antacids. Sodium bicarbonate can be used up to 200grams per dosing to provide short term relief, and neutralize gastric acid, it is usually given after feeding whole grain rations.",
                "Give your horse probiotics. Probiotics include yoghurt products containing Lactobacilli spp. As a daily, these probiotic supplements can help as the beneficial bacteria competes with ulcer forming bacteria.\n\n\nProstaglandins can also combat bad bacteria. These are recommended in horses that have developed ulcers because they have high doses of NSAIDs."

            "intro": "If food or an object becomes stuck in the throat and blocks the flow of air, the flow of oxygen is cut off to the brain, and the person will eventually lose consciousness. It's always helpful to be prepared to treat an unconscious person who isn’t breathing with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). One of the most important distinctions is knowing the differences between performing CPR on an infant (under the age of one), a child (age one to age eight), or an adult.",
            "steps": [
                "Check for breathing. If the choking infant (younger than one year old) has become unresponsive, you should first assess the situation.[1] Quickly look around for food, toys, or whatever else may have caused the choking. Then check to see if the choking infant is showing any signs of breathing—chest rising or hearing breathing when you place your ear close to the infant’s nose and mouth.",
                "Have someone call 911. If someone other than you is around, have that person call 911 while you begin taking first aid steps for the infant. Note that if you’re the only person around and the baby isn’t breathing at all, you should begin CPR before calling 911 to first ensure that the baby receives circulation and oxygen.[2]\n\nIf you’re the only person around, but others are within earshot, then proceed through the next steps while periodically yelling for help. Ideally, someone else will be able to call 911 as you attend to the baby.",
                "Look for an obvious obstruction. With the infant laying flat, tilt the baby’s head back and open his mouth. If you can see the object, remove it, but only if the object is easily removed. If the object is lodged, you don’t want to risk pushing it farther into the infant’s throat.[3]",
                "Attempt to clear the airway if the baby is conscious. If the baby is unconscious or shows no signs of breathing, skip to the next step. This step should only be taken if the infant is conscious; if the infant is unconscious, begin CPR immediately. If the unresponsive infant shows signs of reduced breathing, then you want to attempt to clear the infant’s airway. Try the following methods:[4]\n\nSit, rest your forearm on your thigh, and place the infant facedown along the length of your forearm. The baby’s head should be angled slightly downward as well. Use the heel of your hand to thump the middle of the infant’s back five times with firm but not violent thumps. Watch to see if the object dislodges.\nRoll the infant face up onto your forearm—again with the head lower than the torso. Place two fingers along the center of the baby’s breastbone and quickly compress the chest five times. Check the mouth again to see if the action dislodged the object.\nRepeat steps attempting to dislodge the object as long as the infant shows signs of breathing and a pulse. If the object dislodges and the baby resumes breathing, then call 911 and watch the infant closely until help arrives. If the infant stops breathing entirely at any time in the process or becomes unconscious, move to the next step.",
                "Perform chest compressions. If the infant is unconscious, then you need to begin CPR. The method for giving an infant CPR is different than with a child or adult. Begin with chest compressions that will help maintain blood circulation to the brain. To perform chest compressions on an infant:[5]\n\nPlace the infant on a hard, flat surface—a table or even the floor will suffice.\nPut two fingers on the center of the infant’s chest. Imagine a straight line between the baby’s nipples, and place the fingers just below where this line would be.\nPress down with your fingers to compress the chest around 1.5 inches (3.8cm). The rate of the compressions should be around 100 per minute. However, ensure that the infant’s chest rises all the way back up between compressions.\nPerform thirty compressions, counting them aloud as you go.",
                "Check the infant’s airway. The compressions may have dislodged the object in the baby’s throat. After thirty compressions, check the infant’s airway again. Tip the baby’s head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with the other hand. Open the mouth to see if you can now remove the object—again, only if easily removable. Spend several seconds (no more than ten) feeling for breath and watching the infant’s chest to see if he or she is breathing without assistance.",
                "Perform rescue breathing if you are trained and comfortable doing so. If the unconscious infant still isn’t breathing, you may want to perform rescue breathing techniques. However, new recommendations by the American Heart Association state that if you are untrained in CPR, you can just do chest compressions, and do not need to perform rescue breathing.[6] To rescue breathe for the infant:[7]\n\nCover the infant’s mouth and nose with your mouth.\nUse your cheeks (not your lungs) to deliver a quick, gentle blow of air that lasts one second. Provide a second breathe the same way.\nWatch the baby’s chest to see if it rises, which will tell you if the breaths are getting around the blockage or not.\nIf air does not go in, reposition the head and try one more breath. If the first breath goes in, give a second rescue breath, and then do another set of chest compressions.",
                "Call 911 if you’re by yourself. You want to repeat the cycle of CPR (thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths[8]) for two minutes—about five cycles. If no one else has called 911 yet, this is the point where you should stop performing CPR to call emergency responders.[9]\n\nThe seconds can be precious. Continue giving the baby assistance as the phone rings, etc.\nFollow the 911 operator’s instructions once the call is answered.",
                "Repeat CPR cycles. Continue performing CPR cycles. Between chest compressions and rescue breathing, continue taking a few seconds to see if the blockage has been dislodged and if the baby has resumed breathing. Perform another cycle each time the baby shows no signs of life. Repeat until emergency responders arrive if necessary.[10]\n\nIf you are getting tired, see if there is another person trained in CPR to take over for you or help with two person CPR.",
                "Check for breathing. If the choking child (between ages one and eight) has become unresponsive, you should first assess the situation.[11] Quickly look around for food, toys, or whatever else may have caused the choking.

Grab your fist with your other hand.\nThrust the fist upward into the child’s abdomen quickly. Perform five times if necessary while watching to see if the object dislodges.\nCheck for breathing.

Performing chest compressions on a child is different than performing on an infant or an adult. To perform chest compressions on a child:[16]\n\nSet the child down on his back on a flat, hard surface (most likely the floor), and kneel down beside the child’s shoulders, so you don’t have to reposition between chest compressions and rescue breathing.\nPlace the heel of your hand on the child’s chest between his nipples. Use only one hand since two can provide too much force.\nPosition your upper body over your hand and use your body weight and your arm to compress the child’s chest. You want to compress two inches (five centimeters). Press quickly at a rate of around 100 compressions per minute. However, you want the child’s chest to rise again completely between compressions.\nCount the compressions aloud to a total of thirty.",

To perform a rescue breath on a child:[20]\n\nCover the area with your mouth completely to form a seal.\nDeliver a breath that lasts approximately one second into the child’s airway. If air does not go in, re-position the head before you try one more breath.\nProvide a second breath before returning to chest compressions.",

If you can see the object, remove it, but only if the object is easily removed. If the object is lodged, you don’t want to risk pushing it farther into the person’s throat.[25]",
                "Attempt to clear the airway if the person is conscious. If the person is unconscious or shows no signs of breathing, skip to the next step. This step should only be taken if the person is still conscious; otherwise you should begin CPR immediately. If the choking person shows signs of reduced breathing, then you want to attempt to clear the airway. Two methods are available based on how well you can move the person around:[26]\n\nBack blows are the easiest option for a person who you cannot easily move. Roll the person onto his side or back and use the heel of your hand to thrust against the person’s back between the shoulder blades. Repeat fives times, watching for the object to dislodge.\nIf you can lift the person, try abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) by placing your fist just above the person’s navel and quickly thrusting in and upward with both hands. Also repeat five times while watching for the object to dislodge.\nCheck for breathing. If the person stops breathing completely at any point or becomes unconscious, then proceed to CPR.",
                "Perform chest compressions. If the person is unconscious, then you need to begin emergency CPR to maintain circulation and provide oxygen. Performing chest compressions on an adult is different than performing on an infant or a child. To perform chest compressions on an adult:[27]\n\nRoll the person onto his back on a flat, hard surface (most likely the floor) and kneel down beside the person’s shoulders, so you don’t have to reposition between chest compressions and rescue breathing.\nPlace the heel of your hand on the person’s chest between his nipples. Place your other hand directly over your bottom hand to provide more leverage.\nPosition your upper body over your hands and use your body weight and your arms to compress the person’s chest. You want to compress two inches (five centimeters). Press quickly—a rate that allows you to perform 100 compressions per minute. However, ensure that the person’s chest rises completely between compressions.\nCount the compressions aloud to a total of thirty.",
                "Check the person’s airway. The compressions may have dislodged the object. After thirty compressions, check the airway again. Tip the person’s head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with your other hand.[28] Open her mouth to see if you can now remove the object—again, only if easily removable. Spend several seconds (no more than ten) feeling for breath and watching the person’s chest to see if she is breathing without assistance.[29]",
                "Perform rescue breathing if you are trained to do so. After thirty chest compressions, you want to provide two rescue breaths (remember the 30:2 ratio[30]). You can use mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose breathing, but ensure that you pinch the person’s nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing.[31] To perform rescue breathing on an adult:[32]\n\nCover the area (mouth or nose) with your mouth completely to form a seal.\nDeliver a breath that lasts approximately one second into the person’s airway. If air does not go in, re-position the head before you try one more breath.\nProvide a second breath before returning to chest compressions.",
                "Continue performing CPR. Unless the person begins showing signs of life and breathing on his own, then you should repeat CPR cycles (thirty compressions and two breaths) until paramedics arrive and take over.[33]\n\nIf you become tired, see if there is another person trained in CPR who can take over or assist with two person CPR."

        "wikiHow to Live with Someone Who Has PTSD": {
            "intro": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex disorder that is the reaction to a traumatic event. Traumatic events that can result in PTSD often include war, rape, kidnapping, assault, natural disasters, car or planes crashes, terrorist attacks, sudden death of a loved one, sexual or physical abuse, extreme bullying, death threats, and childhood neglect. The symptoms of PTSD can arise suddenly, gradually, or come and go over time. PTSD does not just affect the person with the condition; it also affects the loved ones who are involved in his or her life. If you are living with someone with PTSD, it is important to recognize how PTSD can affect your home life, learn how to deal with symptoms of PTSD that may arise, and help your loved one in as many ways as you can.",
            "steps": [
                "Be aware of the common symptoms of PTSD. Because symptoms of PTSD change how a trauma survivor feels and acts, this can dramatically change the family life and affect everyone in the family. Trauma causes symptoms that can make it hard to get along with others or cause withdrawal. In order to live with someone dealing with PTSD it’s best to be mindful of their symptoms, there are also ways to help your loved one, and remember some important aspects of dealing with the disorder.\n\n\nSome of the symptoms central to PTSD include re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoiding reminders of the trauma, and increased anxiety and emotional arousal. Additional symptoms include anger and irritability, guilt or self-blame, substance abuse, feelings of betrayal, depression and hopelessness, suicidal thoughts and feelings, feeling alienated and alone, and physical aches and pains.",
                "Give your loved one support during flashbacks. Re-experiencing the event can involve intrusive and upsetting memories of the event that your loved one experienced. This may also include flashbacks, where the sufferer feels like they are back in the trauma, or witnessing it as if it was happening in front of them. When your loved one is experiencing a flashback, give them space and keep them safe.\n\n\nDon’t ask a lot of questions of the person, simply be nearby in case they need you, and give them anything they need when the flashback is over. Individuals with PTSD often find it difficult to talk about their traumatic history. Give your loved one support without being too overbearing.",
                "Help your loved one to cope with flashbacks by practicing relaxation techniques. Your loved one with PTSD may also re-experience the event by feeling intense distress when reminded of the trauma. This distress can lead to a physical response (i.e. pounding heart, rapid breathing, nausea, muscle tension, and sweating). Symptoms like this can be helped by practicing relaxation techniques.\n\n\nOne very powerful relaxation technique that could be used is deep breathing exercises. Have the person breathe in for four seconds, hold their breath for four seconds, and then release their breath slowly over the course of four seconds. Have them repeat this exercise until they feel calm.",
                "Make your loved one feel safe in your relationship. After a traumatic experience, your loved one may have a hard time feeling safe, even in their own home. While you might not be able to promise that nothing bad will ever happen to them again, you can show that you are there to protect them and are fully committed to your relationship with them. Ways to make them feel safe include[1]:\n\n\nDiscuss plans for the future with your loved one to help them remember that their future is wide open and not limited.\nKeep your promises. Being reliable will help your loved one to begin to regain trust in people.\nCreating a routine that you both stick to. Routines can help them to feel that they have some semblance of control in their lives.\nTell them that you believe that they will recover.",
                "Try to understand why your loved one is withdrawn. Avoidance and withdrawal are two of the major symptoms of PTSD. These symptoms can lead to a loss of interest in favorite activities, a detachment from others, and emotional numbness. All of these things can be really hard on loved ones who are living with the person with PTSD. Remind yourself that your loved one’s withdrawal is not caused by a lack of caring, but by the pain that the person feels.[2]\n\nForgive your loved one when they decline to join in on family gatherings, but do not stop inviting them. Remain persistent.\nLet your loved one know that what they are experiencing is ok. While it might hurt you that your loved one chooses to decline your invitations to do things, you must let them know that you understand why they are feeling the way they are, and that you accept them for who they are.",
                "Challenge your loved one’s distorted thoughts. Your loved one may harbor negative thoughts about themselves or the situation. Persist in challenging them about their negative thoughts regarding themselves or the future. Keep your tone light and express your love and positive thoughts without condemning them.\n\n\nFor example, if your loved one feels like the traumatic experience is their fault, calmly reassure your loved one that it is not their fault. Remind them that they are being unnecessarily harsh on themselves.",
                "Help your loved one to fall asleep at night. People with PTSD may find it hard to fall asleep at night. While you cannot control the thoughts that pop into your loved one’s head, you can create a healthy sleeping environment for your loved one.\n\n\nPractice relaxation techniques with your loved one before they go to bed. This can include deep breathing exercises.\nSet the temperature to a level that your loved one is comfortable at. Cooler temperatures can help to induce sleep. Work with your loved one to figure out what temperature is most conducive for sleep. This is generally between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 to 22.2 degrees Celsius).[3]\n\nHave your loved one turn off all electronics for at least an hour before they get into bed.",
                "Help your loved one manage their irritability and anger. PTSD can make a person develop levels of irritability that they never experienced before the traumatic event. While your loved one will most likely go to therapy to work on their anger management, there are also ways that you can help your loved one control their irritability.\n\n\nHelp your loved one to distance themselves from the upsetting situation before reacting. When you see your loved one getting upset, take them aside and tell them to go take a walk, or go to another room and take several deep breaths.\nHelp your loved one to start journaling about their thoughts and emotions (especially anger). Journaling can help them express themselves without actually having to talk to anyone about their experience. Getting their feelings out on paper may help to reduce the likelihood of them feeling irritable when interacting with others.",
                "Try to avoid the things that could startle your loved one. PTSD can cause an extreme jumpiness and hyper vigilance. Try to avoid starting your loved one, as this could inadvertently trigger a flashback. For instance, try to avoid making sudden movements around your loved one.\n\n\nAnnounce when you are home, or call out to them when they get home so that they know that you are there.\nLet them know when you are going to do something that involves a loud noise, like running the blender, or hammering a nail into a wall.",
                "Be sure to give your loved one space. They are dealing with a lot and they may or may not be able to talk about their experience. You need to be tolerant of their needs during this time. Do not pressure your loved one into talking about what they are going through. Simply be there for them if they do feel like talking.[4]\n\nBe prepared for your loved one to want to be alone one day, but supported the next. Give your loved one what they need.\nOffer support in other small ways. These supportive gestures could include taking them somewhere they usually enjoy, making them their favorite dinner, or just spending some quiet time with them.",
                "Discuss the benefits of getting treatment with your loved one. Seeking help from a mental health care provider (a psychiatrist or psychologist) is a very important part of recovering from PTSD. Going to therapy as early as possible once the PTSD has appeared is preferable, as early treatment can mean a faster recovery.[5]\n\nPeople with PTSD can also seek help in a community-based center or clinic.\nThe longer symptoms are allowed to continue without the help of a mental health care provider, the harder it will be to change and recover from those behaviors.",
                "Collect information about treatment for your loved one. If your loved one has agreed to go to treatment, make it easier for them by gathering information on different therapists.\n\n\nYou can also set up an appointment for them once your loved one has determined which therapist they would like to talk to .",
                "Go to a counselor to seek help if your loved one refuses to go to therapy. If your loved one refuses to get treatment, go to a counselor yourself and discuss the challenges you are facing when dealing with your loved one’s PTSD. The counselor may be able to give you some tips on how to handle your loved one’s symptoms and refusal to get help.\n\n\nTell your loved one that you went to see a therapist. Telling them about your experience will normalize going to a psychiatrist, which may make them feel better about seeking help themselves.",
                "Let your loved one know that you are willing to participate in family counseling. If your loved one is having a hard time accepting the need to go to therapy, tell them that you will go to therapy with them. Therapy for families of people suffering from PTSD can be found in many community clinics.",
                "Take time to take care of yourself. While your main concern may be to take care of your loved one, it is incredibly important that you spend some time taking care of yourself. If you are constantly thinking about how best to help your loved one, you are sure to get tired. When you are tired, you are more likely to lose your patience, which can make matters worse. Because of this, make sure to set some time aside each day to relax and recharge.",
                "Spend time with other people. While you are supporting your loved one, it is also important to talk to others who can support you during this difficult time. Talk to people you trust, like other family members or friends, about what you are going through.\n\n\nSimply expressing your emotions can make the situation seem more manageable.",
                "Join a support group. Aside from talking to family or friends, you may also find it helpful to talk with people who are not involved in your specific situation, but have gone through what you are now going through. Support groups are good places to share your experiences and learn from others who may have insights into ways that you can make your situation more positive.[6]\n\nTo find a support group, run an internet search for support groups for families of people with PTSD in your area. You can also look at community bulletin boards, or talk to a therapist about where to find support groups.",
                "Take time to take care of yourself. Family member frequently devote themselves totally to those that they care for, and in the process, neglect their own needs. Pay attention to yourself. Watch your diet, exercise, and get plenty of rest. Take time to do things that feel good to you and that keep you healthy.\n\n\nMake time to do things that you love each day. Whether that is going to see a movie, reading a book, going on a hike, or simply relaxing in a bath, set aside some time to do things that make you happy each day.\nTry doing yoga or meditation, both of which can help to center you and keep you refreshed.",
                "Try to maintain family routines. These family routines could include gathering together for dinner, game night, or a recreational outing. Maintaining these family traditions can help both your loved one, and the rest of your family feel like there is a semblance of normality.",
                "Set up an appointment with a therapist for yourself. If you feel like you are having trouble coping with your situation, do not hesitate to seek professional help. Talking to a therapist may help you to come up with strategies regarding how to cope with your loved one’s PTSD, as well as ways to keep yourself happy and healthy.\n\n\nYou can also call a support line that is designed for caregivers living with someone who has PTSD. Call the National Caregiver Support Line at 1-855-260-3274.",
                "Understand that PTSD does not just affect the person who is suffering from the condition. Families may also experience various reactions to their loved one who is suffering from PTSD. It can be difficult to cope with a loved one who is constantly pushing people away, or experiencing traumatic flashbacks. These symptoms can create common reactions that family members and other loved ones experience.\n\n\nKeep in mind that these reactions are normal, and that living with someone with PTSD can be very difficult.\nThese reactions are described in the following steps.",
                "Keep your feelings of sympathy. People often feel very sorry that someone they care about has had to suffer through a terrifying experience and that their loved one still suffers from PTSD. However, too much sympathy can be a bad thing leading a family to “baby” a trauma survivor. This can send the message that the family does not think the trauma survivor is capable of overcoming the ordeal.\n\n\nFor example, if you do not expect your loved one to pursue treatment and go to therapy appointments, they may feel like you don’t have confidence in their ability to recover.",
                "Be prepared for some conflict. Because irritability is one of the basic symptoms of PTSD, conflict is often inevitable. A short fuse and readiness to defend or fight rather than back down could result in more angry outbursts towards family members and others.",
                "Try not to be offended by your loved one’s detachment. After a traumatic experience, many people with PTSD will become disconnected from their loved ones as they cope with what has happened. This can be very hard for you and other family members but try to give the person space.\n\n\nRemember that they are not distancing themselves because they want to hurt you, but rather because they are dealing with what has happened to them.",
                "Try to banish feelings of shame or guilt. Family members can often feel guilt or shame after a traumatic event for many reasons. They may feel guilty because they feel responsible for caring for their loved one. Family members may also feel shame with dealing with their loved one, as they may feel like they are failing. Remember that dealing with a loved one with PTSD is not easy, but that you are doing all that you can to help them.",
                "Understand that negative feelings towards your loved one with PTSD is normal. These negative feelings can include anger and resentment towards the traumatized person or towards those who traumatized the individual."

        "How to Work on a Container Ship": {
            "intro": "Container ships play a vital role in global commerce, helping companies move cargo on major waterways throughout the world. The continuing expansion of international trade is putting increased demand on the global container fleet and its seamen. Many jobs aboard container vessels are physically demanding and require personnel to remain at sea for extended periods of time, but entry-level merchant mariners are well-paid, have ample opportunity for advancement, and have the opportunity to travel to major cities throughout the world.",
            "steps": [
                "Be physically fit. Jobs on container ships are extremely physically demanding, so you must be prepared to be on your feet for long hours, lift and carry heavy items, and perform various other physical tasks, depending on the kind of job you accept.",
                "Be prepared to be at sea for an extended period of time. In addition to being physically strong, you should be mentally prepared to work long hours, spend most of your time in confined quarters with the other crew members, and be away from your family for weeks or even months at a time.\n\n\nYou may end up at sea for longer than expected if there is bad weather, a mechanical problem, or even a strike at one of your ports.",
                "Get a passport. A job on a container ship will likely require you to travel all over the world. It's best to have your passport well in advance of your job search so you don't have to worry about it.",
                "Understand the roles on the ship. Most jobs on a container ship fall into three departments: the engine room, the deck, and the galley. Crewmen in the engine department are responsible for repairing and maintaining all mechanical and electrical components of the ship. Crewmen on the deck are responsible for navigation, security, and maintenance, depending on their rank. Crewmen in the galley are responsible for preparing and serving meals and cleaning.\n\n\nIf you have experience as a cook, engineer, mechanic, firefighter, nurse, or doctor, you may be able to transition into the maritime industry without first performing entry-level jobs.",
                "Decide which entry-level job is right for you. If you don't have any experience working at sea or any special training, you will need to start your career in an entry-level position. All of these positions offer the opportunity to advance to higher level positions once you have the appropriate level of experience. Some of the most common entry-level container-ship jobs include:[1]\n\nOrdinary seaman (OS): This is an entry-level deck job. An OS will learn fundamental seamanship during a specified training period. Ordinary seamen will grease lashing gear, chip rust, and paint fixtures. As they gain experience, new deckhands are given additional responsibilities. Eventually, an OS can expect to be designated as an Able Bodied Seaman, or AB. AB duties include lookout watches, handling tow lines, and making security rounds.\nWiper: New engine room personnel start as wipers and perform a wide range of functions, including basic maintenance, cleaning, and inventory. A wiper usually moves into a position as a qualified man of the engine department, or QMED. QMEDs perform a range of functions, including maintaining and repairing the engine and auxiliary-power systems.\nSteward utility: New galley hands start their maritime careers in utility roles, which include dish washing, laundry, and housekeeping. These crewmen often later become stewards, which involves helping with meal preparation and supervising other galley personnel.",
                "Apply for a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC). The first step towards attaining the credentials that you will need to work on a U.S. container ship is to apply for a TWIC, which is issued by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). You must submit an online application and then visit a TSA office to present identification and immigration documents, get fingerprinted, and have your picture taken.[2]\n\nYou will have to pay a fee of $128 when you submit your application. Discounts are available for individuals with a hazardous materials endorsement on their license or with a Free and Secure Trade card.\nYou will not be granted a TWIC if you have been convicted of certain crimes, including espionage, treason, terrorism, and murder.",
                "Obtain a Merchant Mariner's Credential (MMC). Everyone working on a U.S. container ship must receive an MMC, which is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The MMC is a photo ID that lists a crewman's qualifications, grade, and endorsements, which will dictate what kind of jobs you are allowed to hold on a container ship. Depending on the endorsements you apply for, you will have to pay a fee of $45-$140 for your MMC. To apply for a Merchant Mariner's Credential, you must do the following:[3]\n\nSubmit proof of U.S. citizenship, permanent resident status, or foreign citizenship. Foreign citizens are only granted MMCs by the United States Coast Guard if they are enrolled in the United States Merchant Marine Academy.\nBe at least 16 (with parental consent for minors).\nPass a background check. If you have a criminal record, the Coast Guard will consider your eligibility on a case-by-case basis.\nEither currently hold or be in the process of applying for a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC).\nPass a physical exam. Requirements are different for entry-level and qualified individuals, so make sure you submit the appropriate form.\nPass a drug test.\nSubmit proof of previous experience at sea and successful completion of the appropriate examinations for your desired endorsement and grade. This is not necessary for entry-level endorsements.",
                "Earn your STCW credentials. A certificate in Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) will allow you to work on vessels that operate in the oceans worldwide. If you have an MMC but not your STCW credentials, you will only be permitted to work on inland waters in the United States or in the Gulf of Mexico within 12 miles of the shore.[4]\n\nEntry-level crewmen must complete a five-day Basic Safety Training class that covers basic firefighting techniques, survival skills. basic first aid, and personal safety and social responsibilities. Higher level positions will require additional training.\nThe cost of the complete five-day program is $1025 at New England Maritime, but the cost may be different at other institutions.[5]",
                "Consider a bachelor's degree. If you would like to start working in a higher level position, consider attending a four-year maritime academy. When you graduate, you will hold a bachelor's degree and a license to serve as a Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer.[6]",
                "Do an apprenticeship. There are apprenticeship programs available for individuals who want to work their way up from entry-level positions to qualified positions quickly. This is a great option if you are hard-working and career-driven, but have no experience working at sea.[7]\n\nCheck Seafarer's International Union and Workboat Academy for opportunities. You may be able to find other organizations that offer apprenticeship programs as well.",
                "Join a union. Once you have the proper credentials, you might want to consider joining one of the many shipping unions in the United States. Your union can help you with job placement, and can also be a great way to network with other people in your industry.[8]\n\nYou do not need to be a member of a union to get a job on a container ship. If you encounter long waiting lists, you may be better off looking for a non-union job.",
                "Apply with shipping companies. If you decide not to do an apprenticeship or join a union, look for your first job on a container ship by searching through online job boards and classified ads. Apply for positions by submitting a resume that outlines your skills and experience, as well as a cover letter that explains why you would be a good fit for the job.\n\n\nWith a quick online search you will find a variety of job boards that are devoted to maritime positions.[9] Also check major job boards like Monster and CareerBuilder.\nYou should also visit the websites of all of the shipping companies you can think of. They may have job openings posted on their websites that you did not see on job boards.",
                "Try asking around. If you are in a busy port city, you might be able to find a job simply by visiting the ports and asking captains if they have any job openings. Have your credentials with you in case one of them says yes.",
                "Work your way up. Once you have a job on a container ship, you will need to decide if you want to advance in your maritime career. If you enjoy the work and would like increased responsibilities, you will need to gain experience and fulfill the necessary requirements to obtain additional licenses and endorsements to your credentials.[10]\n\nThe precise requirements for licensing and endorsement will depend on the kind of job you want to hold. Check with the U.S. Coast Guard to find out what examinations and other requirements you will have to fulfill in order to meet your career goals."

        "wikiHow to Write Sad Stories": {
            "intro": "If you're a fan of heartbreaking tales, you may want to write your own sad stories. It can be hard to write sad stories as it's easy to come off as melodramatic. You do not want to use sad events just for the sake of sounding tragic. Focus on building an interesting story with strong characters. This way, sad events will affect readers more. Do some prewriting to think of sad topics you understand. Structure your story following the basic elements of storytelling. Then, write and revise your work.",
            "steps": [
                "Free write about sadness. If you want to write sad stories, you'll have to start by seeking inspiration. Consider what makes you sad. For about 10 minutes, free write on the topic of sadness. Talk about the kind of situations that make you sad.\n\n\nThere are a lot of changes that come in life that can make people sad. Friendships and other relationships ending can cause sadness. The death of a loved one can also make someone sad. Sadness can also be caused by more minor events. Losing a family pet can be sad. Having to move to another city can be a cause of sadness. Consider what you think sadness is. What thoughts and emotions do you associate with sadness?\nAs you write, talk about your own personal experiences with sadness. For example, when in life did you feel the most sad? Why? You may be able to use experiences from your own life in a short story.",
                "Seek inspiration. The best way to become a better writer is to read more. If you want to know how to write sad stories, you'll have to read a lot of stories with unhappy themes and plots.\n\n\n\nRead sad stories. Ask your friends and teachers for recommendations for sad stories. As you read, do so actively. Pay attention to how writers build their stories and characters. How do the stories start? How do they end? Why do you have an emotional response to these stories? Ask yourself these questions as you read.\nPay attention to what works in these stories. When writing a short story, you only have a short period of time to get your reader's attention. As you read short stories, pay attention to opening lines. How does the writer get your attention? Where does the story start? Many short stories may start when some of the important actions or events have already occurred. Authors may recount such events in flashbacks or imply them through means like character dialogue.",
                "Learn how to begin a story. If you want to write a story, you'll need to know basic story structure. Stories are made up of exposition, rising action, a climax, falling action, and a resolution. The first parts of the story come with exposition and rising action.\n\n\nYour exposition comes at the beginning of the story. This is where you explain who the main character is and what he or she is doing at the beginning of the story. Exposition should be brief and grab the reader's attention.[1]\n\nA story's rising action is the series of conflicts that move the story forward. No story can exist without a problem that needs resolving. In a sad story, there should be an element of tragedy to that problem. For example, maybe your main character is caring for her sick dog. The rising action could include her taking the dog to the vet, finding out the sickness is worse than she thought, and struggling with the setbacks and challenges of her dog's medical needs.[2]",
                "Outline your story. Once you've figured out basic story structure, write a short outline for your story. Write out how your story will begin, what rising action you'll include, the climax, and how the story is resolved.\n\n\nAn outline can be brief. It's not necessary to use full sentences in an outline. You just need to have some sense of the basic events that will occur. You can separate your outline into the five elements of story structure: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution.\nAn outline should use numbers and letters for structure. Big headings, like \"exposition,\" can be marked with a roman numeral. You can use letters or regular numbers to elaborate on aspects of that heading. For example, \"I. Exposition, a. introduce Susan.\"\nTo help you see how to write an outline, let's return to this article's example. You could begin the outline with something like this: \"Exposition, a. Introduce Ada, crying in art class, b. Sad to be reminded of her father's cancer, c. Returns home alone (her mother is at work) to help care for her ailing dog.\"",
                "Find a good opening line. An opening line is a vital part of a short story. A good opening line should grab the reader's attention instantly. Readers should go into the story curious, wanting to continue reading.\n\n\nA good first line should establish a strong voice and offer some hint as to what is to come in the story. If you're writing a story centering around themes of sadness, it's important to hint at this in your opening line.[3]\n\nIf you're stuck, read a few opening lines from your favorite sad stories. You can also Google search something like, \"Most memorable opening lines.\" Read through a variety of opening lines and examine how they function. Why are they successful? Why do you want to keep reading?\nTake a look at this article's example. In this story, Ada has to eventually accept her dog's death. Let's say her father died of cancer and it's difficult for her to deal with loss. Write an opening line that conveys a sense of coming loss, while also emphasizing past sorrows. For example, \"Ada did not mean to start crying during Mr. Cheny's lecture, but she couldn't help but feel that loss was following her everywhere.\"",
                "Create close relationships within your story. Readers are more inclined to be emotionally moved by strong relationships. This makes sense. Everyone has people in life they are close to. When a story deals heavily with relationships between characters, a reader may experience a stronger emotional reaction.\n\n\nShow how your characters are close. They can finish each other's sentences, help each other without question, and comfort each other during bad times.[4]\n\nIn this article's example, there are three main characters: Ada, her mother, and her dog. You could write scenes of Ada tenderly caring for her dog, showing how much she loves him. You could also show that's she close to her mother. Ada and her mother could joke lovingly with each other. A brief flashback to Ada's father's funeral could reveal Ada helping her mother cope in the aftermath.",
                "Build up to the main sad event. As you progress through your story, engage with rising action. Build up to the sad event. People are unlikely to be moved by sadness without buildup. If you're not emotionally invested in a character or a situation, you're unlikely to feel sad when reading a story.\n\n\nEach scene in a story should move it forward in some way. Refer to your outline when in doubt. What is your climax? How can you get your characters to this climax? In this article's example, the dog could have a seizure and need to be rushed to the vet. Ada learns the dog's cancer has spread to the brain. Do not just focus on the actions. Pay attention to the emotional story at play. Ada will eventually argue with her mother. You can show her mother gently trying to help Ada brace for the worst case scenario and Ada resisting.[5]\n\nAs you write these scenes, think about the heart of your story. What is the main point or realization for your characters? Each scene should build up to this point. In our example, Ada may have to accept death is part of life. Try to emphasize inevitable death and decay in each scene.[6]",
                "Write your climax. Once you've written the falling action, focus on your climax. This is the height of action in your story. Try to write a climax that is intense without feeling forced or melodramatic.\n\n\nRemember the character's hopes and dreams at this point. This can help you see what is at stake here. In this moment, what is the character fighting for? What will happen if he or she fails?[7]\n\nThe best stories have a moment of discovery. This should be somewhat universal. Your character will discover something about herself or her situation that can point to a universal theme or message.[8]\n\nIn this article's example, the climax is when Ada and her mother fight about having the dog put to sleep. On the surface, what's at stake is the dog's life. On a deeper level, Ada's sense of purpose is at stake. Helping the dog gives her a sense of control over the inevitability of death. A larger realization here could be that accepting death is part of life. Perhaps Ada's mother could say something along these lines during their fight.\nLevels can benefit sad stories in many ways. In addition to making sad moments feel more intense, readers crave theme and character development. A reader may be more moved by a sad story if he or she feels they learned something along the way.",
                "Choose an appropriate ending. Once you've written your climax, it's time to end your story. A story's ending should offer some kind of resolution to the action. A reader should feel satisfied by the ending, even if it's unhappy. You should not leave your reader with any lingering questions or concerns.\n\n\nYou need to build up to your ending with falling action. This is what leads to your conclusion. The main character should make peace with his or her fate. All scenes after the climax should lead to a resolution, serving to lessen the tension rather than build it up. In our example, Ada could have a good cry and then tell her mother she's ready to accept her dog's death.\nA sad story does not necessarily have to have a sad ending. However, it may feel inauthentic to have things suddenly turn around for your character. If you want to give a sad story a happy ending, make sure you build up to this point. In our example, do not have it suddenly turn out the dog is okay after all. This is not realistic. Instead, maybe it could end a few months in the future. While Ada misses her dog, she has moved on with a new puppy.",
                "Avoid melodrama. Melodrama is a common pitfall in sad stories. You do not want your readers to feel like you're trying to force sympathy for your characters. Avoid overwriting tragic descriptions or emotional dialogue. This is often where melodrama creeps in.\n\n\nMelodrama can sometimes be hard to spot, especially if you're invested in a story. In the first draft, you may be desperate to get everything out on the page. It's okay, and even helpful, to overwrite in your first draft. However, when you read your work over for revision, be very strict with yourself.\nEliminate any bit of description or dialogue that isn't absolutely vital. Often, less is more when writing a sad scene. If you're describing Ada's dog dying, maybe you could describe this in only one or two sentences. This allows the audience to experience the moment on their own. A certain perspective will not be forced on them.[9]\n\nThinks of your audience's larger perspective, as well. In our modern world, sad stories are all too common. People are at a point where they may be somewhat numb to tragedy that feels generic. There are many stories on the news about death and disease. Zooming in on the emotions of a particular character can help you avoid melodrama. Yes, losing a pet is sad, but why is your character specifically sad? What unique brand of sadness does she feel?[10]",
                "Focus on writing a quality story first. People are often resentful of work that's tragic for the sake of tragedy. People appreciate good storytelling, character development, humor, and dialogue. Remember, your story and your characters come first. The tragedies they experience come second.\n\n\nReally get inside your characters' heads. Establish backstories for your characters that are unrelated to the tragic events they face. Give characters believable personality traits, likes, dislikes, and other quirks. A character should not be defined solely by bad events.\nMake tragedy feel organic to the story. Do not have the protagonist's mother suddenly drop dead, despite having shown no previous signs of illness. This will feel like a cheap ploy to garner sympathy. If you plan on killing off a character, offer some hints first. Maybe that character is nervous after a doctor's appointment, for example.",
                "Add some humor. A story that's too heavily invested in tragedy can rub readers the wrong way. Many incredibly sad stories offer a great deal of levity along the way. For example, John Green's bestseller The Fault In Our Stars includes a lot of humor while telling a very sad story. The film Steel Magnolias is famous for its fusion of laughter and tears. Look at these works for inspiration on how to use humor.",
                "Remind the reader of the good times during sad moments. As you revise, you'll want to increase the sadness in the story. Comb through your work and look for ways you can increase the emotional intensity. One way to make sad moments sadder is to remind readers of better times.\n\n\nWhat makes sad moments upsetting is how much they contrast to happier times. This sharp contrast is often jarring. It can strike an emotional chord with readers.[11]\n\nWhen describing a sad scene, add a throwback to a happier moment of your story. For example, say in an earlier scene Ada's dog could make a gurgling noise that sounded like, \"Hello.\" This made Ada and her mother laugh. In a later scene, when the dog is on his deathbed, it could make that noise again. A previous happy noise is now tainted with a sad moment.[12]",
                "Make your audience love your characters. Spend some time reviewing a character's good qualities. People will be more moved by tragedies if the characters involved made a positive impact on others. You can add a few sentences as a character is dying, for example, briefly reminding the reader of the positive impact he had. In our example, you could write something like, \"Riley wagged his tail at Ada, still the loving and loyal dog he'd always been.\"[13]",
                "Draw connections between tragedies. A good way to help enhance sadness in a story is to link your tragedies. Make connections between different sad and traumatic moments. This adds extra emotional impact.[14]\n\nIn our example, you could easily draw a parallel between Ada's dog's death and her father's death. Ada could feel sad that, once again, she's failed to stop the inevitable. This will make readers feel for the character. She has gone through a lot."

            "intro": "Belize is a small English-speaking nation located in Central America along the Caribbean Sea between Mexico and Guatemala. It is home to natural beauty and a tranquil environment that is sought after by many retirees and travelers. While Belize is a beautiful tourist destination, many people decide to stay in Belize long-term as permanent residents or become citizens. While some red tape and patience is required, getting citizenship in this country is not incredibly difficult.",
            "steps": [
                "Research available options. There a few different ways to become a citizen or resident of Belize, and they each have different sets of application procedures and eligibility requirements.\n\n\nPermanent Residency\nQualified Retired Persons Program\nCitizenship",
                "Apply for citizenship by descent. If you have family members who are Belizean citizens, you may qualify to apply for citizenship by descent before you move to Belize.\n\n\nCitizenship is granted to individuals born in Belize and to the children and grandchildren of citizens of Belize.\nYour Belizean parent or grandparent does not need to be alive at the time of your application for you to receive citizenship, but you will need to be able to prove that they were legal Belizean citizens.",
                "Marry a Belizean. If you marry a citizen of Belize, you are eligible to become a Belizean citizen as well. [1]\n\nBelizean citizens can file for citizenship for their foreign born spouses as soon as their marriage is legalized.[2]\n\nMarriages are investigated to make sure they are not fraudulent immigration scams.\nAll children from this marriage are automatically eligible to become Belizean citizens, whether they are born in Belize or in another nation.",
                "Apply to become a naturalized Belizean. If you do not qualify for citizenship through marriage or descent, you will need to go through the citizenship application process. This is a long-term process that has a specific set of requirements that must be met.\n\n\nBelize requires the applicant to have lived in Belize as a permanent resident for a minimum of 5 years before they can apply for citizenship.\nThe citizenship application is usually processed within 6 months, but may take up to a year, or more.[3]",
                "Enter Belize on a tourist visa. When you decide to move to Belize, you will first need to obtain a tourist visa to remain in the country for over 30 days. If you have received citizenship status through marriage or descent, this is not applicable to your situation.\n\n\nAll visitors, besides cruise ship passengers, must present a valid passport before entering the country. Your passport must not expire within three months of your arrival date.\nYou can stay in Belize for up to one month without a visa.\nIf you decide to stay longer than a month, you must go to the Immigration Department in Belize City or Belmopan to receive a visa extension and to pay for a new tourist visa. [4]\n\nAll prospective Belizean residents must enter the country on a tourist visa until they have completed one year of residency.",
                "Renew your tourist visa. Tourist visas are intended for short stays, and can be extended up to one year. They do carry certain requirements and can be renewed.\n\n\nCheck to see if your current country of residence requires a specific Belize visa to enter Belize. [5][6]\n\nThere is a flat rate fee for a tourist visa that increases after the sixth month of your stay. [7]\n\nIf you are driving or boating into Belize from either Guatemala or Mexico, you will receive a temporary importation permit for your transportation. [8]\n\nYou cannot legally work in Belize with a tourist visa so ensure that you come to the country with enough funds to sustain yourself.",
                "Apply for permanent residency. Permanent residency is the first step in becoming a citizen in Belize if you are not the relative or spouse of a Belizean citizen. Applicants for permanent residency must live in Belize for one year prior to applying.\n\n\nTo become a permanent resident, you must first enter the country on a tourist visa. You will then apply for residency and renew your tourist visa every 30 to 90 days until your residency is denied or granted.\nDuring this one-year period, you may not leave the country for more than 14 consecutive days.\nTo apply for permanent residency you will need to complete Permanent Residency Application form, take an HIV and STI test, provide proof of a clean criminal record from the police, and two recommendations from individuals who have known you for at least one year. [9]\n\nThere are fees associated with applying for permanent residency. The fees range from $250 to $5000 USD and vary based upon your home nationality. [10]\n\nOnce you receive residency, you will pay $62.50 USD for a residency card.",
                "Apply for the Qualified Retired Persons Program. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you may also apply to be a Belizean resident through the QRP program. This is a shorter process and is an attractive option for older individuals and retirees. [11]\n\nTo qualify you must be at least 45 years old and be able to show that you have adequate financial resources to live in Belize, because you cannot legally work in Belize as a QRP.\nYou must provide financial documents that demonstrate that you have the resources to deposit at least $2,000 USD each month.\nTo maintain your QRP status, you must spend at least one month out of the year in Belize. You can live in any other nation you desire in the remaining 11 months if you wish.\nQRPs are considered non-residents for banking purposes so they can set up a bank account with a local or offshore bank in Belize.\nQRP status is not the same as citizenship, it is a separate program that is akin to residency. [12]",
                "Apply for citizenship. To receive nationality status (i.e. citizenship), you must become a permanent resident, and have been a legal resident of Belize for a minimum of five years. If you become a citizen through descent or marriage, these requirements will not apply to your case.\n\n\nAfter five years of residence, you can now apply for citizenship.\nThere is a provision available to register an applicant’s minor children at the same time an individual applies for nationality. [13]\n\nIf you achieve nationality, any of your children under age 18 are entitled to become a Belize citizen, regardless of where they were born. [14]\n\nYou must apply to be a citizen in Belize, you cannot apply remotely.",
                "Collect the necessary documents. While you are compiling your citizenship application, you must prepare certain documents, pay certain fees, and understand application procedures.\n\n\nYou must be prepared to swear an oath of allegiance, have a basic understanding of the Belizean Constitution, and recognize Belize's sovereignty.\nApplications for citizenship must be made in person while in Belize. [15]\n\nYou will need your birth certificate, identification forms like a Social Security card, to fill out an application form, provide financial statements, a police record proving you have no prior criminal convictions, a medical test proving you do not have HIV or any STIs and to pass background checks.[16]\n\nThere are fees associated with the citizenship application, just as there are fees associated with permanent residency and tourist visa applications.",
                "Renounce or maintain other citizenships. While there are a few ways to become a citizen of Belize, there are some restrictions to keep in mind.\n\n\nYour home nation may require you to denounce your citizenship or have limitations in place for citizens with dual nationalities. Be sure to know the laws of your home country about holding dual citizenships. [17]\n\nBelize allows its citizens to hold dual nationality status with other nations. This means that if you are a Belize citizen you can also be a citizen of another country, if that country also allows you to hold dual nationality status.\nHowever, if you are a Guatemalan national you must renounce your Guatemalan citizenship to become a Belizean citizen.",
                "Enjoy the benefits of citizenship. There are quite a few benefits to becoming a citizen, rather than remaining a permanent resident.\n\n\nYou can vote in Belizean elections as a citizen.\nYou are eligible to hold a Belizean passport.[18]\n\nYou can join the Belizean armed forces.\nYou become a member of CARICOM. The Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, allows you to travel freely between member nations in Latin American and the Caribbean.

            "intro": "Epilepsy is a medical condition that originates in the brain and causes recurring seizures. Having a seizure can put you at risk of head injury and other complications, so it's important to be mindful of safe practices at home and in the outside world. Integrating good practices into your life will enable you to have the same opportunities and experiences as everyone else.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn to recognize seizure symptoms. Signs of a seizure can differ in patients and in the way the episodes unfold. The most common types of seizures include convulsions and loss of consciousness. Other symptoms might include arms and legs jerking, mouth trembling or a blank gaze.\n\n\nSeizures are generally categorized as either partial or primary generalized. Identification is based on cause and point of origination.[1]\n\nPartial seizures or simple focal seizures begin in one section rather than the entire brain. Often, the person is aware of what is happening to them.\nComplex focal seizures affect a larger part of the brain. The person might be confused and have difficulty understanding what's happening to them.\nSecondary generalized seizures begin as focal and spread to both sides of the brain. The person loses consciousness and convulses.\nGeneralized seizures can come on quickly. Both sides of the brain are affected. Seizures are accompanied by unconsciousness, convulsions, rigidity of muscle and jerky movements.",
                "Make a seizure response plan. Carry the plan with you at all times. You can print out the form and fill it in.[2] You can also use a small notebook for the plan if you like. A Seizure First Aid app for your smartphone is available.[3]\n\nInclude the names and numbers of your doctors, pharmacies and two emergency contacts.\nDescribe the types of seizures and how they’re manifested. Include their length and how often they occur. Note triggers for the seizure.\nProvide a first aid plan for treatment. Include how long someone should stay with you, keeping the mouth clear and other details specific to you.\nList medications, including amounts, when they’re taken and how they’re administered. Refer to other treatments you receive such as VNS.\nStipulate when emergency services should be called. Be specific in describing the circumstances such as a seizure that lasts more than five minutes.[4]",
                "Apply first aid to the person undergoing a seizure. The primary focus of epilepsy treatment during a seizure is to make sure the person doesn't get injured. In most cases all that’s required is making the person safe and offering comfort. [5]\n\nReassure the person and stay with them until you’re absolutely certain that the seizure has stopped.\nStay calm. It will help the person having the seizure to stay calm. It will also help others on the scene not to panic.\nHelp the person to be comfortable. Help them to sit or lie down. Provide a pillow to protect their head.[6]",
                "Protect the person suffering from seizure from accident. A person suffering a seizure is unable, to some degree, to control their body. Falling or thrashing movements are fairly common. The setting in which they’re having a seizure should be quickly appraised for potential dangers. Minimize the harm a seizure victim can do to themselves.\n\n\nMove dangerous objects away from the person having the seizure.\nSteer the person away from potential dangers such as a street or a hot stove. Lead them as gently as possible to a safe area.\nDon’t forcibly restrain a person having a seizure. It could lead to injury.\nDon’t place anything in the person's mouth while the seizure is in progress. It may lead to broken teeth. They may choke on the object.\nHelp the person to breath properly. You may need to turn them on their side with the mouth pointed downward to prevent choking.",
                "Call emergency services if necessary. Although in most cases the help you offer is to protect the person suffering a seizure from hurting themselves, there are some situations that will require you to call for medical help.\n\n\nIf you’re in a public place, have someone else call while you stay with the person who is having the seizure.\nCall for help if it’s the first time the victim has had a seizure or if the cause of the seizure isn’t known.[7]\n\nCall emergency services if the seizures are repeating rather than stopping.\nIf the seizure continues for 5 minutes or more, call emergency services.\nIf the seizure victim is unconscious for 10 minutes or more, call emergency services.\nCall for emergency help if the person undergoing the seizure requests that you do.[8]",
                "Talk to your doctor about how you'll treat your epilepsy. Usually, medication will be tried first to lower the occurrences of seizures. Selecting the most effective anti-seizure medication might take time and experimentation. In many cases, once the right medication is found it can be quite effective. Some patients are able to stop taking the medication eventually with no further epileptic episodes.[9]\n\nThere are many types of epilepsy (over 40) and seizures. There are numerous drugs designed to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures.\nYour doctor will diagnose your type of epilepsy and treatment options will follow.\nAntiepileptic drugs are quite successful in preventing seizures as long as they’re taken as prescribed. About fifty percent of patients are able to control their epilepsy over long periods of time.\nTake your medication regularly. Make it a routine that’s so consistent the chances of forgetting to take medication are nil.\nSpeak to your doctor about identifying triggers, like fatigue, that signal an oncoming seizure.",
                "Consider Vagus Nerve Stimulation. VNS sends continuous short electrical impulses to the brain through the vagus nerve in the neck. This method can be an alternative if other treatments aren’t working.\n\n\nA battery is implanted under the skin and is the source of the charge.\nThe doctor will program the battery to deliver an electric impulse every few minutes.\nThe patient will wear a magnet on a wrist band or on the belt and has the ability to produce extra electric stimulation if needed by waving the magnet over the implant.\nPatients self-administer the electric stimulation when they feel a seizure coming on.\nIn some cases VNS is effective in eliminating or reducing seizures. In others, it’s ineffective.[10]",
                "Change your diet. A ketogenic diet can help to reduce the occurrence of seizures.[11]Ketogenic diets are sometimes recommended for children when medications aren't successful.[12]\n\nKetogenic diets are low in carbohydrates and high in fat content. The body breaks down fat for energy (instead of carbohydrates).\nKetogenic diets require the dieter receive close supervision to ensure they receive proper nutrition. Side effects from the diet also have to be monitored.",
                "Talk to your doctor about surgical options. In some cases an underlying condition of the brain is responsible for seizures. Under the right circumstances, surgery can successfully remove areas of the brain responsible for producing seizures.\n\n\nIf seizures begin in the same area of the brain, surgery might be a successful option.\nIf the area of the brain can be removed without doing harm to key functions, such as speech or eyesight, then surgery is an option.\nSurgery is specialized and complicated and requires tests that may take weeks to be completed.\nElectrodes may have to be implanted in the brain prior to the surgery to find the source of the seizures since the source will be removed.\nIf no further seizures occur after surgery, the patient has a good chance to live seizure free.\nIn some cases, surgery is not effective.[13]",
                "Make your home safe. A seizure could come anywhere in the house and at any time. Your seizures may be controlled by medication. It’s still important to prepare for the unexpected by taking a few precautions that will make your home safe.\n\n\nPlace fire alarms on all levels of the house. Use fire retardant materials for your furniture. These precautions help to address the possibility of a seizure while cooking or smoking.\nInstall soft floors. Use cushioned flooring, non-slip linoleum or carpets rather than hard surfaces such as ceramic.\nChoose non-coarse rug material to avoid rug burns in the event of a prolonged seizure.\nCover all hard edges of furniture, or purchase furniture with rounded edges.\nUse safety glass to avoid injury by shattering glass during a fall.\nCover radiators and pipes that could cause burns. Be sure that your heaters are fixed to the wall and not free-standing.\nUse a low-level bed in your bedroom to cut down on injuries from falls.\nIf you sleep face down purchase a safety pillow which has air holes to prevent suffocation.[14]",
                "Take special precautions in the kitchen. The kitchen poses a particular threat because of appliances such as stoves which are sources of high heat. Care must be taken to avoid burns incurred during a seizure in the kitchen.\n\n\nPans and pots on burners should have handles pointed inward so that you can’t knock them over.\nUse a wheeled cart to transfer hot plates, platters and pots to the dinner table, rather than carrying them.\nInstall heat-resistant work surfaces so that you can slide hot pots and pans, rather than lift them.\nConsider using a microwave for your cooking to prevent fires from food cooking too long, and to avoid hot surfaces that could be the source of an injury.[15]",
                "Make your bathroom safe. The bathroom, like the kitchen poses a special set of risks for someone who falls during a seizure. Make changes to your bathroom with an eye to eliminate the risk of drowning.\n\n\nUse doors that open either way so that someone can reach you if necessary. You can use an “Occupied” sign on the outside of the door to allow for privacy.\nConsider flooring made of rubber, or a non-slipping surface rather than a hard surface.\nA shower is safer than a bath because water drains away.\nUse toiletries made of plastic rather than glass or ceramic.\nIf you do choose a bath over a shower, it’s best to have someone in the house in case you have a seizure while in the tub.\nA monitor which allows someone to listen while you’re in the tub is a good precaution.\nRun a shallow tub and begin with cold water to prevent injury if falling into the tub while the water is running.[16]",
                "Sleep on your back. Protect yourself from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), a phenomenon in which a person with epilepsy dies suddenly, usually in her sleep.[17] Though it is not clear why this happens, research shows that in 73% of SUDEP cases, the person was sleeping on her stomach. As a precaution, sleep on your back.[18]\n\nConsider a wristwatch, bed alarm, or even a service dog to detect seizures that may occur while you are sleeping.[19]",
                "Take extra steps if you live alone. If you live alone, you will need to make some additional adjustments to ensure your safety.\n\n\nIf you wander during seizures, make sure you lock your doors so that you don't go outside.[20]\n\nConsider signing up with a medical alert hotline, such as Lifeline. You will be provided with a pendant that can detect if you fall and alert emergency services.[21]\n\nMake sure your floor is always clear of any obstacles.[22]\n\nPlace a chair or some other barrier in front of appliances that could burn you if you fell onto them during a seizure, such as the stove or radiator.[23]",
                "Know your rights when it comes to work. The American with Disabilities Act prevents discrimination against people with disabilities including epilepsy. You should be able to live a normal productive life and not be hindered from seeking or maintaining employment.[24]\n\nPotential employers can’t ask you if you're epileptic.\nYour employer should provide a safe environment to accommodate your disability as long as those accommodations are reasonable.\nSpeak to another employee about your disability so that you’ll have someone who can care for you if you have a seizure. Provide your colleague with appropriate guidance literature and instructions about how to care for you.\nDon’t work to the point of fatigue as that could bring on a seizure. If your shifts are too long, ask your supervisor to cut them back.\nAvoid high places and machinery with moving parts at work.",
                "Decide whether or not you should drive. Driving can be an essential part of every day life, depending on location. In most states, people who have not had a seizure in three to five years are allowed a license without the obligation to provide a medical report.[25] Keep in mind that your decision affects everyone you encounter on the road.\n\n\nStop driving if seizures reoccur. You’ll need to speak to your doctor and your ability to drive will have to be evaluated.\nIf you’ve had a seizure due to an unusual occurrence and have lost your license because of it, you could appeal the decision. You’ll probably have to provide evidence from your doctor that you’re taking medication that he prescribed.[26]",
                "Learn to travel safely with epilepsy. Whether you travel by car, plane or train, you and traveling companions should understand the type and frequency of your seizures. Research your path and destination to know the availability of medical help, accommodations to meet your needs, and flexibility in altering travel plans if a seizure occurs.\n\n\nIf you’re seizure free and able to drive safely, confirm there are no problems with the legality of driving.\nTake frequent breaks if you’re driving. You’ll want to avoid fatigue.\nDon’t drive at night if you’re photosensitive.\nIf you’re flying, the Aerospace Medical Association recommends you travel with a companion who can care for you in the event of a seizure.\nBring a Seizure Plan with you. Also carry a letter from your doctor confirming you’re cleared to fly.\nCarry your medicines and label them with specific directions in case someone who isn’t familiar with your condition must care for you.\nRequest a seat in the front of the plane where you’re more visible to flight attendants so that you’ll receive immediate attention if needed.[27]"

        "wikiHow to Be a Water Fight War Lord": {
            "intro": "Tired of getting soaked in a water fight before you can inflict damage on your foes? Here is how you can start winning water fights.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a weapon before the fight starts. You have a choice here, you can choose a large weapon and run slow, or a little weapon and run fast. It's usually easier (and more fun) to choose a large weapon, as this will give you more ammunition, range, and power in your shooting. A good large weapon is the Water Warriors Orca.\n\n\nWeapons can be more than water guns. For example: Water hose, sponges, water balloons, water drenched rags, etc.",
                "Choose a backup weapon. No matter what size your primary weapon is, have a backup, just in case. The easiest backup is just an inexpensive water pistol that can fit in your pocket.",
                "Carry extra ammo. If you chose to have a small weapon, you can omit this step. However, the extra ammunition can change the tide of a battle. To carry extra ammo, simply carry two water bottles full of water. Use water bottles with squirt tops to speed up the refilling.",
                "Hide ammo in the battlefield. If you have access to the battlefield beforehand, hide ammo in places where only you'll be able to find it. Try hiding 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles full of water in bushes, underground, in trees, or wherever else you can hide them. Don't let the enemy know where they are.",
                "Dress appropriately. Try to wear colors that can blend in with your surroundings as much as possible. If you are fighting at night, where a dark, dark blue. If you chose to use a large weapon, try to wear \"cargo\" pants so that you can carry your extra ammo in the \"cargo\" pockets and backup gun in the pockets.",
                "Try to wear clothing that water brushes off. Raincoats can provide good protection but are sometimes too heavy. A light windbreaker is better.",
                "If you aren't planning on hiding, wear as little as possible. Water comes off of skin easily, so opt for going shirtless or wearing a swimsuit.",
                "Map out the battlefield. If you have access to the battlefield beforehand, look around it. Remember where any good hiding spots are and where your ammo is hidden. Look for good sniping spots, easy-to-climb trees, etc. If you have time, you can even draw and label a map, and share it with your teammates.",
                "Practice shooting your primary gun. Before the battle, get to know your gun. Know how far it shoots, if it has more than one nozzle, how much water it holds, how many pumps it takes, etc. Practice angled shots to learn how far up to angle your blaster to range your opponents at a given distance. Practice shooting targets. You can use stood up paper plates, styrofoam cups, people, etc. as targets.",
                "Practice with your secondary gun. Now that you know your primary gun, you need to know your backup gun. Know everything about it. Practice switching from your primary to your secondary gun while running. If your primary has a neck strap, just let go of it and pull out your secondary. Remember to do it while running. Again, practice shooting targets with this.",
                "Know when to use your backup gun. You should use your backup gun when you are reloading or pumping your primary gun, you ran out of ammo for your primary gun, or you dropped, lost, or gave your primary gun to a teammate.",
                "Know when it is safe to pump or reload. You should only reload or pump when you are hidden or guarded by teammates. It is not safe to do it out in the open. If you are running away and need to pump before you can shoot again, just use your backup.",
                "Strategize your shooting. If your opponent has a good chance of dodging your shot, don't waste the time and ammo on a full shot. Instead, use brief tap shots. You can recover more quickly from this using just one or two pumps, and you can be ready to shoot again faster.\n\n\nRe-pump after every shot. Most pressurized blasters only need 1 or 2 pumps after a quick tap shot but if you let it run out of pressure it can take 20 or more pumps making you an easy target.\nShoot your enemies when they're weakest. Sneak up on them when they're refueling or pumping and won't be able to retaliate.",
                "Know how to snipe. Sniping isn't always shooting from far away, it is just shooting from a concealed location. A good tactic if you have a big gun is to hide in a bush or tree and wait for someone to pass. When they do, just shoot them with your biggest nozzle and run away fast.\n\n\nChoose your hiding places carefully when sniping. While shooting from high up in a tree can give you a great view of everyone else, it also makes it harder to escape. Plan your escape route when choosing a hiding spot.",
                "Work with your teammates. Work together to come up with a battle plan. For example, have the person with the longest-range gun take out opponents while the rest of the team ambushes.\n\n\nChoose people who are easy to work with and enjoy victory (preferably friends).",
                "Know how to use water balloons. Water balloons should usually only be used as a last resort. They are too hard to transport, and they sometimes don't break on impact. However, if you are hidden in a tree, you can throw them across the battlefield (with a slingshot if you can't throw very well) at a formation of enemies, taking out multiple people with one shot.",
                "Know how to shield yourself. Hide behind anything you can. Try to let only your nozzle and eye (covered in eyewear) be visible to others. If you are being shot at, you can use your gun as a shield."

        "How to Consolidate Financial Statements": {
            "intro": "Many large companies are partially or entirely made up of smaller companies that they've acquired throughout the years. After their acquisitions, these smaller companies, or subsidiaries, may have remained legally separate from the large corporation, or parent company. However, when reporting financial information, the parent company is required to submit financial statements that combine their information with that of their subsidiaries. These documents are called consolidated financial statements and allow the health of the group to be assessed as a whole, rather than piece-by-piece.[1] Consolidated financial statements can be created easily using the following steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine which holdings to report as subsidiaries. For the purpose of consolidated statements, a company is only considered a subsidiary if the parent company holds a controlling interest in that company. Generally, this means that the parent company owns over 50% of the shares of the subsidiary. This is because this share value would give them majority voting power in the subsidiary. However, there are situations where a company can be considered a subsidiary even when the parents owns a smaller percentage of their shares, such as:\n\n\nThe parent has majority voting rights by agreement with the subsidiary's board.\nThe parent has power to govern the policies of the subsidiary under agreement or law.\nThe parent has the ability to remove and replace the majority of the subsidiary's board.\nThe parent has the ability to cast the majority of votes during a meeting of the subsidiary's board of directors. [2]\n\nIn contrast, a parent may own more than 50% of a subsidiary's shares and not retain control. In this case, they are known as an \"unconsolidated subsidiary\" and not shown on consolidated statement.[3]",
                "Gather your paperwork together from all the companies. When you consolidate financial statements, you'll need all of the financial information for each company being considered. This will include information for the parent company as well. Specifically, you'll need access to the books (the record of all transactions) for each company, as books are not kept for the consolidated entity.[4]\n\nIt's easiest to start with the financial statements of the companies being considered if these have already been prepared. This will allow you to simply combine larger line items and go back through the books only to eliminate duplicate items.[5]",
                "Coordinate fiscal periods. In order to consolidate financial statements, you'll need to be sure that all companies' financial reports refer to the same fiscal period. Generally, if there is a mismatch in fiscal periods, you should modify subsidiary's timeline match that of the parent. This should either be done at acquisition or can be done through an adjustment to the subsidiary's financial statements.[6]\n\nFor example, if a subsidiary considers August 31 as its year end and the parent company's year end is December 31, then prepare financial statements for the first subsidiary running from January 1 through December 31. This may involve significant adjustment.",
                "Set up a spreadsheet. This should in a program that you can easily manipulate, like Microsoft Excel. Be sure to create separate pages for each combined financial statement you plan to create. At this point, just start by creating one for the consolidated balance sheet and one for the consolidated income statement.",
                "Add financial information for each company side-by-side. Set up your spreadsheet so that you can see where you'll be adding the information from different companies together. This will help you organize your information later. You'll also want to label the rows with what type of financial information you plan to input there.\n\n\nFor example, for the consolidated balance sheet, label your rows with common titles such as “Cash” or “Accounts Payable” and “Inventory.”",
                "Leave every third and fourth column blank for credit or debit consolidation adjustments. You'll need an area to record adjustments from duplicate transactions as you move forward with the process. Simply be sure to label these columns individually as credit and debit as you would in bookkeeping and label them collectively as \"duplicate adjustments\" or something similar.\n\n\nFor one subsidiary and one parent, simply fill the first two columns with their financial information and leave the next two blank for these adjustments. Leave the fifth column blank too for the eventual calculations of the final, adjusted values.\nFor multiple subsidiaries, follow this same pattern but separate the subsidiaries. In this case your spreadsheet columns should be laid out as follows:\n\n1.Parent financial information\n2.Subsidiary 1 financial information\n3.Adjustments (subsidiary 1)-debit\n4.Adjustments (subsidiary 1)-credit\n5.Consolidated financial information after subsidiary 1 adjustments\n5.Subsidiary 2 financial information\n6.(and on) repeat of process for other subsidiaries",
                "Check your financial statements again. Before combining them it's best to check the financial statements you will be using to ensure that they are for the same fiscal period. If not, you'll want to adjust them now. Going back and adjusting for this later will be much more work. In addition, check your financial statements for any missing information and seek to correct this before beginning to consolidate them.",
                "Create a consolidated balance sheet. Consolidate financial statements by creating a balance sheet that reflects a sum of net worth, assets and liabilities. This is done by simply adding together the separate values from the balance sheets of the parent company and the subsidiaries. The balance sheet will include assets like cash, receivables, and land, as well as liabilities like payable accounts and loans.[7][Image:Consolidate Financial Statements Step 10.jpg|center]]\n\n\nFor example, if the parent has $30,000 in cash and the subsidiary has $15,000 in cash, the consolidated balance sheet would show $45,000 in cash.",
                "Create a consolidated income statement. This document will include all revenues earned and expenses incurred by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Like the consolidated balance sheet, this is done by simply adding the values from the companies' independent income statements together. Included values are measures of money earned, including sales and net income, and also measures of expenses like cost of goods sold and wage expense.[8]\n\nFor example, if the parent company incurred $45,000 in income expense and the subsidiary incurred $20,000 in income expense, the consolidated income statement would show $65,000 in interest expense.",
                "Review the consolidated statements for duplicate values. After the statements have been consolidated, you'll need to check for instances that don't make financial sense. These situations arise when, for example, when money or assets have flowed between the parent and the subsidiary, or when the part of the value of the subsidiary is now reported twice by the parent. In general, the consolidated report should read like the financial statements of one company. Check for the following problems:\n\n\nThe consolidated company owning parts of itself (intercorporate stockholdings)\nThe company owing itself money (intercorporate receivables and payables)\nThe company selling items to itself for profit (intercorporate sales)[9]",
                "Eliminate intercorporate stockholdings. Intercorporate stockholdings refer to the situation where stock in the subsidiary is owned by the parent and is therefore not reportable as stock outstanding in the consolidated statement. Note that this is not true for subsidiary stock held by parties outside of the parent corporation or subsidiary.[10]\n\nAdjustments are made on the consolidated balance sheet by debiting the subsidiary's common stock, additional paid in capital, and retained earnings and crediting the consolidate stock of subsidiary account for the book value of the intercorporate shares.[11]",
                "Account for intercorporate receivables and payables. These refer to situations where, after consolidation, a company can appear to owe itself money. This arises from situations where a parent company owes money to or receives money from a subsidiary for products or services. This results in unnecessarily high values for some of the combined accounts.[12]\n\nAdjustments for this situation are made on the balance sheet by debiting consolidated accounts payable or crediting consolidated accounts receivable by the book value of the duplicated entry.[13]",
                "Delete any intercorporate sales. By transferring inventory between parents and subsidiaries, either party may technically realize a profit, even though no sale has been made. This results in overstated inventory, net income, and retained earnings for the consolidated company.[14]\n\nCorrect this imbalance on the balance sheet by debiting retained earnings of the consolidated entry and crediting consolidated ending inventory by the amount of the sales.[15]"

        "wikiHow to Shovel Snow": {
            "intro": "Have you ever awakened to find that your driveway is covered with snow? Although it seems pretty straightforward, there's a subtle art to this task. Choose the right equipment, take steps to reduce the risk of injury, and use appropriate techniques to clear away snow effectively.",
            "steps": [
                "Wear proper boots. You will need boots that keep your feet warm and dry and provide good traction. Appropriate soles will help you maintain balance and reduce the risk of injury.[1]\n\nWear your boots in combination with wool socks to keep your feet as warm and dry as possible.[2]",
                "Use an ergonomically correct snow shovel. Ergonomic shovels have a bend in the handle and help you to keep your back straighter while shoveling snow, reducing the risk of back injury.[3]\n\nYour shovel should have a long enough handle so that you can keep bending to a minimum while using it. Select a shovel that is right for your height.\nYou may wish to choose a plastic shovel as opposed to a heavier metal one.\nThere are two basic types of shovel: digging and pushing. It is far easier to push snow than it is to lift it, so if the snow is not too heavy try to push the snow rather than lift it.[3]\n\nConsider a shovel with a smaller blade to lighten the load and reduce the risk of spinal injury. The blade is the part that actually shovels the snow.",
                "Use a shovel with a non-stick surface. This will help to make shoveling less tiring by causing the snow to slide off easily.\n\n\nSpray a silicon lubricant on the shovel before using to prevent snow from sticking to the surface.\nA non-stick surface can be produced at home. Simply coat the blade of the snow shovel with shortening or vegetable oil.[1]",
                "Consider any health risks. If you are out of shape, have back problems, or heart conditions, it may actually be dangerous for you to shovel snow. After a snowfall, hospitals are inundated with heart attack victims and patients with wrenched backs. Hire a local teen, borrow a snow blower from a neighbor, or contact a professional snow and ice removal service instead.",
                "Dress appropriately. You need to dress warmly, but not so warmly that you are sweating heavily after several minutes of work. Dress in light layers that are easy to remove and do not restrict your movement. Thermal underwear is a great option for keeping you warm while you work in the snow.\n\n\nBe sure to remove clothing as you heat up while shoveling, as sweat can turn clammy on your skin and actually make you colder. Your skin should remain warm (not hot) and dry.\nWear gloves that will prevent blisters and keep your hands warm and dry.\nYou can also wear hand and foot warmers (like Hot Hands or Yaktrax Handwarmers/Footwarmers) in your gloves and shoes to prevent your hands and feet from getting too cold.\nYou lose a large amount of body heat through your head. Wear a hat and earmuffs to retain that body heat and keep yourself warm.\nIf it is very cold you may consider breathing through a scarf but be careful that it does not obstruct your view.[1] A cold-weather face mask is also a good option.",
                "Stretch. Warm muscles will be more efficient and less likely to get injured. Focus on stretching your extremities (arms and legs) and back in particular.",
                "Spread sand or salt on slippery ground. Some areas can be uneven and cause you to trip, slip or fall, causing injury. Before shoveling snow, spread sand or salt on any particularly slippery locations where you might have to stand while shoveling snow. This will create foot traction and reduce the risk of injury.",
                "Maintain good posture. Remind yourself to keep good posture and maintain the natural curve of your spine. Keep your back straight as you change between the squatting and upright positions.[1]",
                "Lift correctly. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart for balance and bend at the knees rather than at the waist or back. Keep the shovel close to your body rather than extending your arms all the way. Tighten your stomach muscles and then lift with your legs as if you are doing a squat.\n\n\nUse your shoulder muscles as much as possible.\nScoop small amounts of snow at a time so that it will not be too heavy.[1]",
                "Find the right place to put the snow. You do not want to twist your body when lifting snow as this can injure your back. Face the pile of snow front on, keeping your body as straight as possible. Make sure you have a place in front of you to dump your shovel loads. If you have to dump the load on the side, then move your feet rather than twisting your body.\n\n\nChoose a close location to dump loads so that you do not have to carry the snow far.\nIf clearing a certain area then dump the first loads farthest away from you so that the last shovel loads will have to travel the shortest distance to be dumped.\nDo not throw snow over your shoulder! If you must lift snow then move forward it rather than throwing it backwards.[1]",
                "Complete areas with deep snow in parts. Never try to remove deep snow all at once. Rather remove one or two inches (2.5-5cm) at a time, resting in between. This will reduce the weight of the loads and reduce the risk of injury.[1]",
                "Take frequent breaks and drink plenty of water. Shoveling is extremely hard physical work and you need to pace yourself to avoid ill effects. In the cold, you're not as likely to feel thirsty, but dehydration can set in quickly while completing so much physical work. Take your time.\n\n\nStretch while taking breaks to keep your muscles loose. Especially focus on your extremities (arms and legs) and back.[1]",
                "If you feel any pain of any kind, stop immediately and seek medical attention or assistance. Pain can mean a heart attack or injured back, which can occur during snow shoveling activities.[1]",
                "Have a cup of hot chocolate. Although optional, it's traditional in most snowy locations, and helps replenish your fluids. If you do not like hot cocoa, help yourself to some tea, broth, or even just water.",
                "Stretch again. Stretch when you are finished to prevent your muscles from tightening up and causing you pain. You can also relax your muscles by taking a hot shower.",
                "Start early in the day. Fresh snow weighs less than older snow so you should clear snow as soon as it has fallen. As snow sits on the ground it compacts and becomes wet, making it heavier. It can also then turn into ice and become very difficult to remove.\n\n\nWait until the snowplow has come by before finishing the driveway. A snowplow will usually \"plow in\" the driveway at least a bit, pushing more snow onto the edge of your driveway. It can be easier to deal with just clearing the driveway once.\nUse extra care when shoveling snow pushed onto your driveway by the plow. Plows pack the snow, making it much heavier than undisturbed, freshly fallen snow.\nOne shovelful of snow can weigh 20 pounds (9kg) or more![1]",
                "Have a plan. You will need to consider what is the most efficient snow removal plan. You will also have to avoid piling snow where you'll have to just remove it again, so do not block access to snow that still needs to be cleared.\n\n\nIf you are clearing a rectangle, it is better to work from the center out. First clear a strip of snow around the perimeter of the rectangle. Then, starting in the center, push snow towards the cleared area. From there, lift the snow out of the area.[4]",
                "Clear cars first. Use a brush to get snow off cars before clearing around the car to prevent extra work.",
                "Avoid lifting snow by pushing it instead. Pushing snow is much easier than lifting and can reduce the risk of injury. If you begin early and if the snow is not too deep, then it is better to simply push it off driveways and sidewalks. This is a good way to clear away snow while it is still falling, to reduce accumulation.",
                "Place your hands in the correct positions on the shovel. Spread your hands far apart on the handle, with one hand close to the blade. This will provide more leverage while lifting snow.",
                "Begin shoveling. If you need to dig (to get to your car, for instance), dig using a steady, easy motion. If you are \"pushing\" (as you might when clearing a driveway), hold your shovel at a slight angle and begin making passes back and forth width-wise along your driveway. You should rarely need to move your shovel above waist height.",
                "Don't forget your mail carrier. Make sure you clear around your mailbox every time it snows. If your mail carrier cannot easily reach your mailbox, then they cannot deliver your mail!",
                "Salt and sand as needed. Be careful with salt, as it can hurt your lawn, landscaping, and your watershed. It can also damage driveways and other paved areas. Use salt only if the temperature is warm enough (above 0 degrees F/-17 degrees C).\n\n\nSand provides traction, but if more snow falls on top, it will become useless.\nSalting the ground before or during a storm can actually increase the amount of snow on your sidewalks and driveways because dry snow sticks to a salted paved area but does not stick to an unsalted paved area."

        "How to Get Bad Smells out of Carpet": {
            "intro": "Many people enjoy the softness of carpet, but it can quickly become dirty. Because carpet is so absorbent, it tends to hold onto the pungent smells from spills, accidents, and smoking. If your carpet smells bad, don’t assume that you need to purchase new carpet. You may just need to do a bit of extra cleaning. With a few common household products, you can get bad smells out of your carpet.",
            "steps": [
                "Treat soiled areas. Before treating your carpet, remove any dried on spills, blot away wetness, and dab soap on noticeable stains. You want your carpet to be in its best state before treating the smell.",
                "Sprinkle baking soda onto the carpet. The baking soda will work to neutralize the odors that are trapped in the carpet. You should create a thin coat of baking soda, so get a large box of baking soda for each room that you plan to treat. If it clumps in spots, use your hand to spread it out.[1]",
                "Let the baking soda sit. The recommended wait time is several hours, but if you have really bad carpet odors, then you may want to let it sit overnight.[2]\n\nKeep pets and children away from the area.",
                "Vacuum up the baking soda. Monitor your vacuum cleaner bag or canister because baking soda can quickly fill it. Empty it out as necessary.[3]",
                "Apply a deep treatment. If baking soda alone doesn’t work, you can make your own deep cleaning treatment with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of hydrogen peroxide, ¼ cup (59 milliliters) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of liquid soap, and 1 quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the ingredients together in an open container. Test it on a hidden area of your carpet before using it on the whole carpet.[4]\n\nUse gloves when handling this treatment.\nDO NOT put a lid on the treatment once it’s mixed.",
                "Pour or spray it on the carpet. Spraying is better because it provides an even coat, but remember to leave the nozzle open and avoid leaving unused treatment in a closed spray bottle. When pouring be careful not to saturate the carpet.[5]\n\nRemember to wear your gloves, especially if you pour the treatment.",
                "Allow it to sit for 24 hours. The treatment needs time to work, so leave it untouched. While you want to ventilate the room, keep it secure from pets and children.[6]",
                "Use a towel to soak up excess liquid. If any wet areas remain, use an old or white towel to remove it. Let the remaining wetness air dry.[7]",
                "Mix white vinegar and ammonia. White vinegar and ammonia will break down the smoke smell in the entire room, including in the carpet. While it won’t completely remove the odor from the carpet, it will start the removal process.[8]",
                "Place your mixture in bowls. Leave enough room at the top of your bowl to prevent it from sloshing over the sides. Use 2-3 bowls per room. Set the bowls out in the room with smoke-scented carpet.[9]",
                "Allow your treatment to sit for 24 hours. The white vinegar and ammonia will absorb and break down the odor, even though it isn’t applied to a surface. Once you’re finished with the treatment, remove and dispose of your vinegar-ammonia mixture.[10]\n\nKeep pets and children away from the vinegar-ammonia treatment.",
                "Treat with baking soda. As with general odors, sprinkle with baking soda and allow it to sit overnight before vacuuming it up.[11]\n\nKeep pets and children away from the area during treatment.\nYou can also try a commercial carpet cleaner, which will consist of scented granules.",
                "Pour distilled white vinegar into a steam cleaner. White vinegar is an effective acidic cleaner. It kills bacteria and removes odors from tar and resin.[12]\n\nYou can also opt for a commercial cleaning product. Some are targeted at smoke smells.",
                "Run the steam cleaner over the carpet. Follow the instructions for your machine. If you absolutely can’t rent a steamer, you can try saturating the carpet with white vinegar. The smell from the vinegar will evaporate away.\n\n\nBe sure to have a fan on, and, if possible, open a window to help prevent mildew from the wet carpet.\nYou can rent a carpet steam cleaner from a hardware store or supermarket.",
                "Allow the carpet to dry. Leave your fan on while the carpet dries. Avoid walking on the wet carpet.",
                "Soak up any remaining wetness. Use a paper towel to clean up the urine spot. If the spot is dry, then wet it with clean water and dab the area with a paper towel.[13]",
                "Apply a green dish detergent. Green dish detergents are recommended for spot cleaning recent pet urine accidents. Put a dollop of green dish detergent on a wet paper towel. Blot the area with the soapy towel to clean up the urine.[14]",
                "Coat the spot with baking soda. While the carpet is still wet, pour a layer of baking soda over it. The baking soda may get damp, but that is okay.[15]",
                "Allow it to sit overnight. The baking soda and soap will need several hours to work. If you’re working on a small spot, cover it with paper towels while it treats.[16]",
                "Spray white vinegar onto the dried urine spot. Don’t remove the baking soda. It’s normal for the area to foam as the baking soda and vinegar react to each other. This reaction between the two substances helps remove the bad smell.[17]\n\nYou can also clean the area with a mixture of water, white vinegar, and baking soda. Simply mix one cup (237 milliliters) of water, one cup (237 milliliters) of vinegar, and two tablespoons (30 milliliters) of baking soda into an empty spray bottle. This cleaner has a shelf life of 2-3 months.[18]\n\nIf the smell still lingers, hydrogen peroxide can be applied to the urine spot; however, you should test it on your carpet in a hidden area first as it can discolor carpet.\nProducts that use enzymes to break down the smell are commercially available and require no extra cleanup.",
                "Allow the white vinegar to sit for five minutes. Monitor the vinegar as it treats the carpet. Make sure that your pets and/or children are kept away from it.[19]\n\nIf you’re using hydrogen peroxide, it should sit for 10-15 minutes.[20]",
                "Soak up the cleaning agents with a soft cloth. Wipe away the remaining baking soda and blot the area dry. Once it’s dry, smell the carpet to determine if the smell remains. If it does, then you may have to use a carpet steam cleaner.[21]\n\nIf your carpet pad is soaked with urine, then you may have to replace it to get rid of the smell.",
                "Use a carpet steam cleaner. If you have a lot of set-in pet odors, you may need to treat the entire carpet with a carpet cleaner, such as a Green Machine or a Rug Doctor. You can use a commercial odor removing cleaner, or you can mix your own cleaner with white vinegar and water. Run the cleaner over the entire carpet and then let it dry. You may need to make several passes to get out the odor.\n\n\nIf you have set in odors, an enzymatic cleaner can help deactivate the odor-causing bacteria. You simply soak the carpet in your cleaning and let it dry, so they’re easy to use.",
                "Address the causes of the mold smell. If you’re smelling mold, then you likely have a high humidity level in your house. Treating the smell won’t be enough to keep your carpet smelling good because the mold spores will continue to thrive. Instead, change your habits to minimize humidity. Run a fan during showers, open a window to let shower or cooking steam out, and use a dehumidifier.[22]",
                "Use a wet-dry vacuum to remove excess water. If your carpet is wet, a wet-dry vacuum can help limit mold growth by removing the wetness that facilitates it.",
                "Mix 1 cup (237 milliliters) of white vinegar into 2 cups (.5 liter) of warm water. For mold smells, dilute your vinegar with water. Make sure that the water is warm rather than hot.[23]\n\nDon’t warm your water on the stove.",
                "Spray your mixture onto the carpet. Coat the entire carpet in the room. The carpet should be damp enough to react to baking soda.[24]",
                "Sprinkle baking soda on top of the dampened carpet. While your carpet is still damp, sprinkle on your baking soda. The baking soda should react to the diluted vinegar.[25]\n\nDepending on the size of your room and the quality of your sprayer, you may find it more convenient to work in small sections of your room.",
                "Allow the vinegar-water-baking soda mixture to dry. This may take several hours or overnight, depending on how much you applied and if you use fans to help the carpet dry.[26]",
                "Vacuum up the remaining baking soda. Dump the baking soda in your outside trash can.[27]",
                "Turn on a fan. To prevent a return of the moldy-mildew smell, hasten the drying time. Depending on the weather, open a window as well to prevent the room from being stuffy.",
                "Consult a professional if the smell returns. If you have water damage or mold, you may need the help of a professional. Mold is a serious issue that can quickly get expensive, so the earlier you get professional help the better it will be for your home.[28]"

        "wikiHow to Prune a Fruit Tree": {
            "intro": "Pruning stimulates tree growth, enhances fruit production, and gives a tree a proper shape. Wait until your tree is dormant to prune it. Always get rid of diseased, damaged, or dead branches. Discourage the growth of multiple trunks and inward-facing branches. Ensure your fruit tree gets adequate light to all its branches and avoid thick tangles of branches that inhibit fruit growth.",
            "steps": [
                "Prune fruit trees in the winter. In the winter, your fruit tree is dormant (and therefore not producing any leaves or fruit). This makes it easier to target the areas you want to prune and promotes the best production possible.[1]\n\nMost fruit trees are best pruned during winter.",
                "Prune your trees in the summer. Some fruit trees need to be pruned during the summer. Cherry trees and apricot trees, for instance, should be pruned in summer.[2] Plus, summer pruning increases the speed of the tree’s branching, and redirects the tree’s energy into growing only the most desirable branches.[3]\n\nSummer pruning, however, comes with certain risks. It could slow down the fruit’s ripening process and expose fruit to sunburn.[4]\n\nGenerally, untrained trees do not need summer pruning.\nSummer pruning is appropriate for trees with visibly dead or damaged limbs, or leaves that are visibly sagging under the weight of excess fruit or leaves.\nTo determine if your tree needs summer pruning, consult a botanist. Botanists are specially trained experts who know a lot about plants. They can help you determine whether or not summer pruning is appropriate for your tree.",
                "Prune young trees right after you plant them. After planting a new, young tree, trim the main trunk down to between 24 and 30 inches (61 and 76 centimeters) high. Trim any side growths down to no longer than two buds. This will equalize the tree’s top with its root system.[5]\n\nIf you’d like a taller tree that is good for sitting under in summer and fall, make this initial pruning cut at a higher point on the young tree.[6]",
                "Trim young trees that aren’t growing well. If you have a young tree that is not growing well, prune it heavily for its first three years. Heavy pruning during the first few years means a lower fruit yield at first, but in the long run your fruit trees will be strong and productive.[7]",
                "Trim healthy young trees less frequently. If your young tree is growing well, allow it to continue doing so. Trim it irregularly or not at all.[8]\n\nIrregular pruning does not have a universally constant definition. It refers instead to the practice of trimming the tree to a lesser extent than you would a normal, mature tree. You might trim it once each winter, or not at all.\nThere are some physical signs that your young fruit tree is ready for pruning. Look for healthy growth characterized by a strong framework of permanent branches. Absent this framework of branches, prune your young fruit tree more often.",
                "Use a heading cut to create a nicely shaped tree. Cut above an outward facing bud at a 30-degree angle. This will encourage the branch to grow up and out in a direction that will give your tree a red wine glass-like shape. If you cut above an inward-facing bud, the branch will grow incorrectly inward toward the tree, which you don't want to happen.[9]",
                "Make a thinning cut. A thinning cut is used to thin out the tree branches and allow more sunlight to reach the limbs. Perform a thinning cut by clipping a branch as close to the collar of the tree as possible, taking care not to leave an exposed node.[10]\n\nPerform thinning cuts on branches that are at least 50% smaller than the diameter of their parent branch.[11]",
                "Perform a bench cut. A bench cut is used to thin out the center of the tree and get rid of strong upright shoots and branches. To perform a bench cut, identify horizontal branches, then cut the branches and shoots coming out of their top side (especially those close to the trunk).",
                "Choose the right tools. Use sharp shears on young trees with branches that are 1/2 inch (1.27cm) in diameter or smaller. Use pruning saws or long-handled loppers for pruning mature trees.[12]\n\nIf you don’t have pruning tools of your own, you might be able to rent some from your local hardware store – a good option for a tool you might use for only a few hours each year.",
                "Sanitize your tools to prevent infection. After pruning a particular tree, dip the blades of your shears or pruning saw in a solution of one part alcohol and one part water for at least 60 seconds before moving on to the next tree. This will prevent disease from spreading to other trees. Alternately, you could use a solution of water and commercial cleaning solutions like Pine-Sol, chlorine bleach, or Lysol. Just mix one part cleaning solution with a volume of water five times that of the cleaning agent and dip your pruning tools in it for at least 60 seconds.[13]",
                "Select which branches to prune. Always cut dead, damaged, and diseased branches (the “three D’s”). Additionally, cut any suckers – short, new branches sprouting from the trunk. Watersprouts – branches that grow straight up from an outward-facing limb and typically appear in spring – should be pruned, too.[14]\n\nRemove competing and downward-growing branches. Downward-growing branches generally do not produce a very high fruit yield.\nGenerally, do not prune branches that are growing out of the trunk at about a 45-degree angle. Anything growing at a much smaller or larger angle should be pruned.[15]",
                "Develop a single leader. If the trunk of the tree splits into several parallel and competing trunks, your tree will have trouble growing and will be more difficult to prune. Prune your tree in such a way that discourages direct upright growth, except from the central trunk. Only the uppermost bud of the leader should be allowed to remain during pruning sessions.[16]\n\nThis system is appropriate for most trees, and crucial for apple, pear, cherry, and European blue plum trees.\nFor a few fruit trees – peach, nectarine, apricot, and Japanese plum trees – pruning to a central leader is unnecessary.",
                "Ensure all branches receive adequate light. Try to prune the top of the tree more heavily than the undergrowth. This allows more sunshine to reach the shaded branches, encouraging them to produce fruit.[17] Additionally, cut branches that are too close together. Every branch should have six to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of space around it. If you have a cluster of close branches, prune the thinnest of the bunch.[18]"

            "intro": "Being a TV reporter or news anchor is an exciting and fast-paced profession. However, if you're in it for just the glamour and the glory, then you may have to rethink your priorities. Being a TV reporter or news anchor not only requires hard work, rigid deadlines, and the ability to talk to the most difficult people, but you may also find yourself spending six hours in 20 degree weather waiting for a hostage situation to break. If you think you have the guts, stamina, and dedication to be a TV reporter or news anchor, then follow these steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Be an articulate speaker. Your voice is key in this field. You should concentrate on projection, enunciation, and inflection. All of these things will help you deliver your “script” in a compelling nature. Be authoritative in your speech. This will give you credibility with your audience. Read newspapers and magazines aloud. Listen to the best journalists in the field when they speak and try to emulate them.[1]\n\nYou'll have to speak loudly and slowly enough for people to understand you, but quickly enough to cover everything you have to say in a given amount of time.",
                "Look good on camera. This doesn't mean that you have to look like a movie star or a Victoria's Secret model. You don't even have to be classically handsome or beautiful. You do, however, have to look appealing on camera, and have that special quality that makes people want to watch you doing whatever you do. This is a mixture of charisma, confidence, and that special something that will make people respond to you even if you're covering a story about a local bake sale.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it can go the other way -- you may be incredibly attractive but may come off as lackluster on camera. Don't think that your looks are a golden ticket to the profession.",
                "Have killer people skills. If you want to succeed in the world of TV reporting or news anchoring, then you have to be able to talk to anyone about almost anything. If you're reporting, you may have to talk to people live, on site, and on camera, even if they aren't comfortable, and your job will be to make them comfortable. If you're an anchor, then you'll have to introduce people to your audience and talk to them in the studio, and use the same skills to make them open up and feel at ease.[2]\n\nYou may not realize that many reporters and news anchors have to write and investigate their own stories, but this may actually be a large component of your job. If this is the case, then you'll need to be able to talk to a variety of people who can give you access to the information you want.",
                "Be free from bias. Tough one, eh? If you want to be an honest TV reporter or news anchor, then you'll have to learn to put your prejudices aside. Even if you lean a certain way politically or feel biased against certain professions, people, or regions, you'll have to do your reporting as objectively as possible. You won't be able to let the people you interview see through to your personal beliefs, or you won't be giving people the honest, unbiased news that they really want.\n\n\nIf you're prejudiced against certain people, they will be much less likely to open up to you.",
                "Have stellar writing skills. Though being an articulate speaker is crucial, being a strong writer isn't far behind. Even if you're just reading what you have to say and improvising as you go along, or if you have to write your own stories, writing skills will get you far in the field. Writing skills will also help you communicate with others if you have to develop your own stories, and your writing should make you sound as professional as possible.[3]",
                "Have ridiculous stamina. If you're the kind of person who needs a nap after working for two hours, then the life of a TV reporter or news anchor is not for you. You may have to work 12 hour shifts, get up at 2 a.m., or spend hours just standing in the same spot during unusually cold or hot conditions waiting for a story to break. And you have to have the ability to work a 10 hour shift, only to be told that a major story just broke and to work 5 more hours until you take care of business.\n\n\nYou will have to be flexible. This is not a job for people who want to work 9-5 and then go home and kick their feet up. Think you can do it?",
                "Get a bachelor's degree. Most TV stations require that you have a college degree, preferably in broadcast journalism. Getting a degree in English or Communications is also a big help. Some schools that have top broadcast journalism programs are Brigham Young University, University Missouri Columbia, Northwestern University, Syracuse University and Arizona State University.\n\n\nTaking a wide variety of liberal arts courses, such as political science or art history, will help you get more experience with a variety of subjects and will make you a more well-rounded reporter or anchor.",
                "Get relevant experience at your undergraduate institution. When you're in college, you'll have to do more than just get your bachelor's degree if you want to take your career to the next level. Join your school newspaper and get some practice writing stories, investigating leads, and understanding the hard work needed to provide your audience with a good story. If you have a local college TV station, try to involved there, eventually ending up as an anchor or reporter if you can.\n\n\nIf your college does not have a local TV station, go for the local radio station. This will still give you some experience with interviewing others and speaking in an articulate manner.",
                "Get some internship experience. You can do this over the summer, between undergraduate semesters, or even after you graduate from college. Getting an internship at a local paper can help you make connections and have a better understanding of the way a news station runs. You may not end up doing much more than answering phones and getting coffee, but if you want to get ahead, you'll have to do it -- with enthusiasm.[4][5]\n\nGetting this experience will help improve your resume greatly. This is the kind of thing that will back up an impressive resume reel.",
                "Consider getting a master's degree in journalism. Though a master's degree in journalism isn't required for you to become a TV reporter or a news anchor, it can help you get a leg up in the profession. Most journalism master's programs, such as the one at Columbia University, are only one or two years long. You may have to pay out of pocket for this degree if you can't get funding or a scholarship, so choose wisely. A journalism degree can help you not only get an appreciation for the field of reporting, but it can also help you get a leg up in the application process.[6]\n\nAdditionally, going to journalism school can help you make valuable connections that may lead to jobs in the future.",
                "Learn how to write for TV. You of course learn some of this in school. Writing for TV is very different from writing a term paper. You need to learn how to write to the images your audience will see on TV. It’s called writing to video. Also, you should keep writing simple and stay away from legalese and clichés. You have only one shot to get the attention of folks at home.\n\n\nThough news anchors most often read from their notes or from teleprompters (while improvising along the way), most reporters have to write their own copy for when they go in the field.",
                "Create a resumé tape. A resumé tape is a reel that shows a sample of your reporting/anchoring skills. It usually starts with a slate – a brief showing of your name and contact information. The slate is usually followed by a montage, which is a short segment of compelling live shots, samples of reporting and anchoring. The montage is then followed by three of your best stories.\n\n\nThe best way to get your first resumé tape is to do one in school; otherwise it can be quite expensive.",
                "Apply for jobs. When you apply for work, you'll need to send both your resumé tape and an actual resumé. The resume will include any relevant experience and education, such as any volunteer or part-time work you've done in the field. You'll also list any major news stories you've covered as well as your roles in presenting them. You can also include your technical experience and proficiency with digital communication devices or systems, since most stations are tech savvy.\n\n\nDon't just apply to the stations that are hiring. Send your tape and resumé absolutely everywhere that you can send it without being a nuisance. You never know when an opening will appear, and having your tape on the right person's desk at the right time can increase your chances of getting that job.",
                "Be willing to move anywhere to get your foot in the door. You won't find your first job three blocks from your house. Jobs are so competitive that you can’t be choosy when landing your first job. Sure, you may want to hold out for San Diego, California but if Biloxi, Mississippi offers you your first job, you should probably say yes. Send your tape and apply everywhere you can, and be prepared to step out of your comfort zone.\n\n\nRemember that the more experience you have, the more command you'll have over where you can live and work. You may not have much control over your first job or two, but once you build up a reputation, you'll have more success in applying for work at stations in more coveted locations.",
                "Start at a small market television station. Everyone has visions of taking over the NBC Nightly News anchor desk, but the truth of the matter is a tiny portion of people who get into the TV news business will ever make it to a top 10 market. It’s a good idea to start your career in a small local market because you can learn all aspects of the business. You will likely do everything like: report, produce, anchor, shoot video, edit and maybe even run the teleprompter with your foot!\n\n\nYou’ll also get the opportunity to make your mistakes. Audiences are much more forgiving in Mobile, Alabama than they are in New York City.",
                "Prepare to get little pay at the beginning. The average reporter job in a small market gets paid between $15,000 and $18,000 a year. Not what you expected? Contrary to popular belief, most TV personalities are not rolling in dough. Television news is a field where the supply outweighs the demand. Basically there are more people who want to be on TV than there are available positions. That’s part of the reason why pay is not competitive.\n\n\nAlso, if you start at a small market station, you will get small market pay. It’s the nature of the business. If making a lot of money in your career is important to you, don’t get into TV news!\nThe anchors in the 25 biggest markets make around $130,000 a year, but these are very prestigious positions.[7]",
                "Work at bigger stations. Once you've put in at least 3-5 years at a small station and have found some success, you can start moving up in the ranks. Apply for work at larger stations, or even medium-sized stations, and see what you can do. Apply everywhere, not just places that have openings, and use your great experience as a way to back up the fact that you'll be an amazing candidate for the job.\n\n\nDon't think that working at the bigger stations, however, will let you be more flexible and to set your own hours more. Quite the contrary. The more prestigious your position, the more rigorous its demands will be.",
                "Find your niche. When you begin, you'll be working as an anchor or a reporter for whatever field is available. But as you advance in your career, you may have more say about what field you'll be reporting in. You can work as a featured news reporter, in consumer news, or in health news, for example. This can depend on your personality and what you like doing the most. If you're more funny and relaxed, then the quirky human interest stories may be more your speed; if you're more serious, then you may cover more intense topics like homicide.\n\n\nIf you don't want to be negatively impacted by the news you share, then you may consider working in consumer, medical, or features news. They may be a little less exciting, but they'll also be less emotionally draining.",
                "Forget about holidays at home. The truth is you will hardly ever get holidays off. You will most likely be working. Established main anchors at TV stations will most likely get holidays off, which means you will be stuck at work. If you constantly move markets every couple of years to increase your salary and experience, you will always be the new kid on the block, which means you won’t have seniority. So, you can kiss Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, Fourth of July, and Labor Day goodbye.[8]\n\nAlso “sweeps” months (when stations monitor how many people are watching) will be off limits for vacation time. These months include: February, May, July and November.",
                "Be prepared for a demanding schedule. You may be placed on the morning shift, the evening shift, a split shift and the weekend shift at any given moment. New reporters especially have very little say in the hours they work. Working overtime is very common and few stations pay overtime.[9]\n\nNot only will your schedule be demanding, but it may change at a moment's notice. You'll need to not only be available, but to be flexible.",
                "Advance your career. There are a number of ways to advance your career, and this doesn't always mean working at bigger and better news stations. You can go \"network hopping,\" which means moving from one station to the next to gain more responsibilities and to build your reputation. However, if you've had enough of this rigorous lifestyle and have built up enough prestige, then you can consider getting into the talk show forum route, work as a syndicated columnist for a major paper, or even turn to being an author, a public relations specialist, an editor, or a college professor.[10]\n\nJust remember that it can take a decade or longer to move past the traditional route of a TV reporter or news anchor.",
                "Keep it professional. Unfortunately, unlike in most other professions, if you make a big mistake in the field of reporting or anchoring, it may be on permanent record. You don't want to be the reporter who is famous for cursing on national television or who muttered an objectionable and offensive term in front of hundreds of viewers. If you make a mistake like that, you may not be forgiven.\n\n\nIf you're also known for public outbursts, you'll need to get that under control before you get behind the camera.",
                "Be persistent. Persistence is a valuable skill any reporter/anchor should have. You'll not only need this skill to land that first job, but you'll need it to move up in the ranks and to really work hard to get that dream job you'll be fighting for. If you investigate your stories yourself, then persistence is a valuable quality that you'll need to make sure you can follow leads, look elsewhere when you get a dead end, and to keep trying until you succeed."

        "How to Dye Hair Bright Red Under Black Hair": {
            "intro": "Deep black hair with vibrant red color underneath is a very popular look. If you want to do a multi-color dye job at home, be prepared to set aside five or six hours to complete the entire process. The black top layer is dyed first, and then the red layer is dyed afterward. Dyeing your hair black is fairly straightforward, even if you’ve never done it before. However, the red layer takes quite a bit more work, since you have to bleach your hair before you add the red dye. Make sure you are well-prepared for this process before you begin.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid washing your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing it. Your hair may feel a little greasy beforehand, but try to tough it out. The natural oils present in unwashed hair will help to protect your scalp and roots from the hair dye, especially when you get to the red layer.[1] The hair dye will also penetrate your hair better and the results will be more vibrant if your hair isn’t squeaky clean when you color it.\n\n\nIf you must wash your hair before you dye it, use shampoo only and skip the conditioner. Hair dye has a hard time attaching itself to recently conditioned hair.[2]",
                "Use a high quality semi-permanent or permanent black dye. Skip the grocery store aisle and pick up your dyes at a beauty supply store. These dyes are usually salon-grade products and will produce better results. Opt for liquid formulas over mousse formulas for this – liquid black dye will result in a darker and more opaque black than a mousse formula.[3]\n\nIf you’ve never dyed your hair before, use a semi-permanent black dye the first time. If you’re more experienced, feel free to use permanent color.\nIf you are a natural blonde, you may want to dye your hair dark brown first, then black. Sometimes black dye on naturally blonde hair can result in a greenish tinge.",
                "Decide how thick you want the black top layer to be. How much black and how much red you want is a completely personal choice – there is no “right” way to create this look. As a general rule of thumb, you can start by putting your hair in a half-ponytail. Scoop it all up, starting at your ears, and hold it back in the same place you’d put a ponytail.\n\n\nFor a slightly more subtle result, pick up a little more hair after you have it in a half-ponytail.\nMake sure to evaluate the different thickness options before you begin dyeing. It’s best not to make any impulse decisions when you’re in the middle of the process.",
                "Separate the top layer from the bottom with clips. Use a hand mirror or have a friend help you so that everything looks even after you separate the top layer from the bottom. Clip your hair firmly into place to avoiding having to deal with wispy pieces falling down while you’re coloring it.\n\n\nMake sure that you clip back all of the face-framing pieces of your hair. These pieces need to be dyed black so that the red layer will appear to be “underneath” the black layer.[4]",
                "Use tin foil to protect the bottom layer of your hair from black dye. Line a sheet of foil up directly beneath the top layer of your hair. It should hang down over the bottom layer. Make sure the foil extends down at least half the length of your hair. Curl the edges of the foil over the sides of your hair. Clip the foil in place on each side, so the foil will stay in place.[5]\n\nThe foil should be right beneath the top layer, protecting the uppermost part of the bottom layer.\nIf you feel confident that you can apply the black dye without getting it on the bottom layer of your hair, you can skip the foil.",
                "Prepare the dye and your work area. Follow the instructions that came with the dye for mixing and developing it. Wear gloves the entire time and keep a towel secured around your shoulders to protect your skin. To protect the dye from staining your face, apply a thick lotion or a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline before you begin.",
                "Pull a chunk of hair out of the clips and apply the dye. Start in the front of your hair and work with one section of hair at a time. Pull a chunk of your hair out of the clip and apply the black dye to the section, taking care to saturate your hair with the dye from root to tip. Use bobby pins or hair clips to pin the finished sections out of the way so you can easily get to the rest.[6]\n\nYou can twist each completed section into a mini-bun and pin the sections like that, if you like.",
                "Finish applying the black dye to your top layer. Pin the sections up as you finish them so that they are kept away from the bottom layer of your hair. Follow the directions included with the box of dye and leave it on your hair for the recommended length of time. Keep a towel wrapped around your shoulders in case the dye drips onto your skin.\n\n\nAs soon as you finish applying the dye, set a timer for the time span the product recommends.",
                "Rinse out the black dye. Before you rinse the dye out, gather the bottom layer of your hair and secure it in a low ponytail. This will keep it out of the way as you finish with the top section. You will need to lean forward and put your head under the water stream to rinse out the dye. Once you’re leaning forward, remove the clips and bobby pins and start rinsing your hair.\n\n\nDon’t get the bottom layer of your hair wet and keep it out of the way.\nIt may be easier if you have a friend help you with this part.\nRinse your hair until the water runs clear.",
                "Dry your top layer of freshly dyed black hair. Squeeze out the excess water, then put a towel in between the top layer and the bottom layer. Flip your hair over and it will fall on the towel without touching the bottom layer of your hair. Squeeze out as much water as you can and towel dry it gently. Blow dry the top layer of your hair as you normally would.\n\n\nKeep the bottom portion of your hair in the low ponytail throughout this process.\nAfter your black layer is completely dry, clip the hair up again so that you can move on to dyeing the bottom layer.",
                "Prepare the bleach. Most of the bright, unnatural dye colors available are semi-permanent dyes. Unless you have natural light blonde hair, you will need to bleach the bottom layer of your hair before you dye it red for the color to show up. If you apply red semi-permanent dye to your hair without bleaching it first, the color will be nearly undetectable.[7] Consider seeing a professional for bleaching, especially if you’ve never done it before.\n\n\nBleaching is not as easy as dyeing your hair. Far more chemicals are involved and these chemicals can burn your skin and severely damage your hair.",
                "Bleach the bottom layer of your hair. Begin with completely dry hair – never bleach damp or wet hair.[8] Read the directions that came with your bleach product carefully. Follow them exactly. Wear the gloves provided and be extremely careful while you apply the bleach and when you rinse it out. Rinse the bleach out with lukewarm water until the water runs clear.\n\n\nMake sure you are working in a well-ventilated area, since bleach fumes are quite strong.",
                "Towel dry the bottom layer gently. Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to remove any tangles. Let your hair air dry about halfway before moving on to the red dye. You don’t want to apply the red to completely dry hair, but it shouldn’t be soaking wet either.[9]",
                "Dye the bottom layer with red semi-permanent dye. Read and follow the directions for application. Place an old towel around your shoulders before you begin to protect your body. Once you’ve got the red dye on your hair, leave it on for as long as you can.\n\n\nSemi-permanent dye is not damaging to the hair, and the longer you leave it on, the brighter the red will be. Try to leave it on your hair for at least three hours.[10]",
                "Rinse out the red dye with cool water. You should still have your top layer securely clipped on top of your head. Follow the directions that came with the dye for rinsing it out. You may need to rinse it out with your head turned sideways beneath the faucet to avoid wetting the rest of your hair. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.[11]\n\nGently towel dry your hair. Allow it to air dry or take down the top layer and style your hair as you normally would.\nYou may want to avoid sleeping on a light-colored pillowcase for a few days to avoid staining.",
                "Protect your hair color from fading. Vibrant hair dyes fade easily. Do everything you can to preserve your color for as long as possible. Use sulfate-free hair products. Look for shampoos and conditioners that advertise as being “color-protecting.” Wash your hair less frequently and always do so in cold water.[12]\n\nAvoid getting your hair wet in a swimming pool, since chlorine can wreak havoc on vibrant colors.[13]",
                "Use a deep conditioner one to two times per week. Bleach dries hair out and, if you aren’t careful, it can damage it and cause significant breakage. Once you start bleaching your hair, you must take very good care of it to maintain its health. Get a good deep conditioner and apply it one or two times per week.",
                "Use a deep-conditioning mask once per week. Hair masks are similar to deep conditioners because they are highly moisturizing, but they usually include proteins and other ingredients formulated to strengthen your hair. A weekly deep-conditioning mask can help to rehydrate dry hair and restore hair cuticles that have been damaged by the bleaching process.\n\n\nLook for products that contain ingredients like glycerin, vitamin E, shea butter, proteins, Argan oil, keratin, avocado oil, Moroccan oil and coconut oil.[14]",
                "Avoid heat-styling your hair as much as possible. Heat opens the hair cuticle and lifts the color out, so limit your use of blow dryers, flat irons and curling irons. When you are using these tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray on your hair first. It will create a barrier between your hair and the heat.\n\n\nAfter bleaching, your hair is going to be much drier than before. This means it can burn more easily. Use heated tools with care.[15]",
                "Reapply the red semi-permanent dye when the color starts to fade. Vibrant colors will begin to fade within a few weeks, unfortunately. However, to revive the red color, you won’t need to repeat the bleaching process – at least, not for a while. Simply apply the red dye to your faded hair and rinse it out as you did the first time.[16] Depending on how well your hair originally took the red dye, you may need to touch up your color as frequently as every other week.[17]\n\nDo not bleach your hair every time you need to touch up the color. This will severely damage your hair.\nPay attention to the condition of your hair and only repeat the bleaching process when it’s healthy and strong enough to withstand the harsh chemicals."

        "How to Deal With People Who Have Anger Problems": {
            "intro": "Someone is agitated and up in your face, or is angry at you for the hundredth time and you want to know how to handle the situation. Yes, it is difficult to know exactly what to do in every type of anger-filled situation involving a family member, friend, co-worker, or stranger. Managing emergency situations and ongoing chronic situations involving people with anger issues require varied approaches and skills. It is possible to become well-equipped to manage these situations, and expand your understanding about anger. Doing so will prepare you for when the need arises.",
            "steps": [
                "Exercise self-control. Remaining calm is one of the first rules to follow when in an emergency situation. If someone is extremely angry, you need to treat the situation as if it is an emergency.[1]\n\nBeing calm will help you make on-the-spot decisions. This can be difficult, so remember to breathe. Your body will be telling you it’s an emergency, but you need to tell yourself you are going to be okay.\nThe person is angry, so you need to show him the opposite emotion: calm. If you match his anger with your anger, then negative emotions will escalate. Don’t allow him to antagonize you into a negative reaction.\nTake a step back to get some space. Hold both hands up in a peaceful way in front of you to gesture that you do not want any trouble.",
                "Establish safety. Determine if the situation is safe. There is no reason why you should put yourself in harm’s way. Many lives have been changed forever due to mistakenly participating in volatile situations. Self-preservation is a primal instinct.[2] Pay attention to it.\n\n\nAt the first sign of a threat to your safety, leave the area as quickly as you can.\nIf you are forced to stay, or sense that you can handle the situation, you will need to shift into problem solving mode.",
                "Clarify triggers. Clarify what situation has triggered the person's outburst. Every situation is going to be different. Anger runs on a spectrum, from irritation to rage.[3] If you are more familiar with the angry person, then you may be more aware of what triggers this person’s outbursts. Clarifying what the person is angry about will allow you to make the next decision on how to handle the situation.\n\n\nListen to what the person has to say and do not interrupt him. Interrupting or talking over the person will only escalate the situation.",
                "Resolve the problem. It is time to take action to resolve the problem. You need to address four things: define what went wrong; generate alternatives for how it can be fixed; select an alternative; and implement your plan.[4] This is the type of discussion that can take place immediately, or you can make plans to discuss it at a later time.\n\n\nBe clear and tell the person that you are not going to fight with him.\nAssure the person that whatever the problem is, it can be resolved.\nYou may need to suggest that the person take a break or a walk. Or, you may want to do the same and come back later to discuss the problem. Cooler heads prevail. The goal is to create some distance from the negative emotions.\nApologize if and when appropriate. You will need to use your judgement as to when to say this. If you say it too soon, it may make the person angry.",
                "Get help. Enlist the support of others. If the situation escalates and you have tried unsuccessfully to calm the situation, then you will need to call for reinforcements. It takes courage and strength to admit that help is needed, but it is necessary.\n\n\nCall the police to restore order or report a crime if one has occurred. It is their job to protect and serve. You need to be willing to ask for their help.\nFamily members or friends may be able to help resolve the matter at hand.\nIf you are dealing with this type of behavior in your home, then contact a domestic violence hotline in your area for advice and assistance.[5]\n\nIf this situation occurs in the workplace, contact your Human Resource Representative to discuss your options.",
                "Assess behaviors. Identify the person’s underlying emotion to help you choose which action to take. Anger, is a useful emotion. It is known as a “cover” or secondary emotion that can mask underlying emotions.[6] If we think about it, anger can be used to display all sorts of underlying emotions including but not limited to: hurt, frustration, and fear, with anxiety topping the list as a common driver to anger. You get to discover which is operating during a conflict.\n\n\nHumans, from an early age, learn to cope with things that happen around them and to them. If they learn to respond in an angry way, then they will use that coping skill over and over. Children carry their coping skills into adulthood. Even though they may cause problems, some people will refuse to change.\nChildren who grew up in a chaotic home have few childhood coping skills except to become hyper-vigilant – always on guard, always externally focused on others, always on edge waiting to see what is going to happen next. [7]",
                "Mediate. Serve as your own mediator (a person who intervenes between two parties to bring about an agreement or reconciliation). Do your best to create a mediation-like environment. In the most successful mediation sessions all parties get their emotional needs met, the truth can be revealed, and the conflict can move toward resolution.[8] Make that your goal.\n\n\nIf you sense the person is getting out of control, then find a way to remove yourself from the situation. You may say things like, “I can see that we aren’t going to resolve this today so I’m going to leave now,” or “We can’t resolve this problem if we can’t talk calmly, so I’m going to take a break and we can discuss this later.”\nYou may be shocked by what is said to you; but maintaining an honest and empathetic stance will help you to understand. Ideally, you can set ground rules from the beginning that there will be no name calling.If the situation doesn't allow that, then you can say, \"We don't have to resort to name calling to get this problem solved. Let's focus on the problem.\"[9]\n\nRemember that you can take a break from the interaction to allow for a “cooling off period.\" This may help the person calm down and approach the situation in a more positive way.[10]",
                "Exercise caution. Approach each situation carefully. People exhibit varying degrees of anger. Some reactions can be mild, and some extreme. Don’t be the one to escalate the problem.\n\n\nAnger can be an impulsive reaction to a stimuli rather than a well-thought out response. You will need to investigate what triggers an anger response in the person with whom you interact. In some cases, a person could be diagnosed with a condition such as Intermittent Explosive Disorder.[11]\n\nThere are times when people just want to vent about a situation and don’t need you to do anything other than listen and say, “I know what you mean.”",
                "Neutralize the anger. Approach an angry person with the goal of neutralizing his anger. Establish a reliable way to disarm and diffuse the situation. For example, say things like, “I know you’re angry about this and I’m sure we can work it out.” If you are caught in a situation with someone who is angry, then there is definitely a conflict that needs to be resolved. You are basically creating a negotiated solution to the conflict.[12]\n\nIf someone is having an anger outburst and you are not, then you will be the one in charge of maintaining control. You can say things like, “It sounds to me like we can solve whatever this problem is, peacefully.” Seek first to understand, then to be understood.[13]\n\nListen to the person who is angry by paying attention to what he says. Without interrupting him, say things such as, “I hear what you’re saying. Let me see if I’m on target here. You’re upset because ____.” Be an excellent listener. Everyone likes to be heard. Wait until the person is finished talking before you comment, and do not interrupt the person. This shows the person that you respect him and want to hear what he has to say.",
                "Maintain self-control. Respond in a way that shows that you have self-control. You may be the only one exercising self-control. It may be difficult to maintain your composure in difficult circumstances; but focusing on a positive outcome will carry you through.\n\n\nBe flexible and remain composed even if he is emotionally “all over the place.” This will help you remain focused on identifying the underlying issues and guide the interaction toward a peaceful conclusion.\nGet him to buy-in to the idea of resolving the matter. Say things like, “I know this is a difficult situation, but I’m confident we can work together to figure this out.” This sets up a positive outcome simply by letting the other person know that you are a willing and optimistic participant.\nAlways be positive when an agreement is reached. Tell the person you are happy an agreement was reached. Ask the person if he is happy about how things turned out and if there was anything that could have made it better.",
                "Consider consequences. Remember that you are human and so is the person who is mad. Keep in mind the bigger picture - the consequences of an unsuccessful outcome – and that may be just the thing you need to keep the conversation on a positive path.\n\n\nFor a person to grow and change he needs an environment that fosters genuine interactions (openness and self-disclosure), acceptance (being seen with unconditional positive regard) and empathy (being listened to and understood. This would be your role in the process of helping someone deal with his anger issues. [14]\n\nBe realistic about the outcome. You may not be able to resolve every conflict. It doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. It's good to remain guardedly optimistic.\nThere will be times when you will have to assert yourself to get your point across, or to shut the conversation down. Remaining unruffled will be the key. For example, you may have to say, \"I understand what you're saying, but I'm going to have to stop the conversation for now. What we're doing isn't working. Perhaps we can find a solution later.\"",
                "Get educated. Take steps to increase your knowledge about anger. The first step in understanding any human behavior is to learn about it. It will give you a strong base of ideas and strategies from which to pull when you are dealing with someone with anger issues.\n\n\nAccess educational material on-line from reputable sources like the American Psychological Association[15] and the American Psychiatric Association. [16]\n\nSubscribe to newsletters from groups that cover subject matter related to anger and other areas of interest.",
                "Express good intentions. Show the other person that you have good intentions by remaining consistent in what you say and do. Many people go through life with a feeling of mistrust toward others. People who guard their emotions are usually those who have been hurt repeatedly in life. It’s not easy to forget when someone violates your trust, but holding onto doubt will likely cause you to suffer.[17]\n\nIt takes time and effort to build trust. Repeated positive interactions are the goal. Simply asking how someone is doing, or remembering that he has a tough assignment coming up at work or school lets him know you care enough to remember.\nThink of ways you can show the person that your actions are inspired by goodness. Be kind. Do things like making the person his favorite meal, or tell the person you appreciate the things he does for you.\nIt takes courage to be vulnerable. Remember a person with anger issues may struggle with this notion. You can show your vulnerability by sharing your own struggles to help the other person feel more at ease.",
                "Expand your emotional vocabulary. The ability to express emotions varies from person to person. Frustration and anger grow when you can’t find the words to express the emotions you are feeling.\n\n\nOnce you expand your vocabulary you can help others do the same.\nSuggest and encourage the person to take classes in non-violent communication. The goal of these classes is to learn to express your feelings and needs with greater clarity and compassion.[18]\n\nGather lists that itemize numerous emotions to help identify the emotions a person is feeling. You can refer to that list to help determine if you or another person's emotional needs are satisfied, and when they are not. [19]\n\nStrong emotions like anger are designed to help you respond to and cope with stress in your environment, but can become bad for us if not handled with care.[20]\n\nResearch has shown that if people have twenty words for anger (irritation, fury, rage, hostility), then they will perceive twenty different states and will better regulate their emotional states as a result.[21]",
                "Demonstrate trustworthy behaviors. Keep your word, tell the truth, be transparent, and give without strings attached. Use these simple wisdoms to show that you are the type of person who can be trusted. [22] Helping others overcome emotional upheaval can be difficult, but in the end you will find greater happiness.[23]\n\nSuccessfully managing situations with difficult and angry people, builds skills that can be used at home, at work and in public. You will be well-equipped to handle each situation with confidence."

Consider using old ammunition boxes or stout wooden crates to store your sharp hand tools.\n\n\nYou can also store them upright in a rigid plastic bin, such as an old dustbin. This will prevent any contact with the blade.\nIt’s best if you don’t jumble bladed tools together to avoid blunting the edges.",
                "Modify your shed's walls to create tool storage space. There are a variety of ways, beyond shelves, to utilize the walls of your shed for storage. Consider these solutions:\n\n\nYou can nail lengths of Velcro wrap to the shed wall and use these to attach your tools directly to the wall.\nDrive some hooks into the shed wall at a height just slightly above your knee. Take some bungee cords or ratchet straps with hooks on the end, hook them to the wall with fairly strong tension, and make elasticated wall storage that will hold your tools flat against the walls.\nPeg board is a terrific way to store items on walls. Get some hooks to hang your tools from the pegboard, and you can hang boxes from them for smaller items like screws.",

Sheds are usually filled with all sorts of useful smaller objects that defy categorization, such as the fitting for a hose pipe, different sizes of screws, and tulip bulbs.\n\n\nOne way to store smaller items is to glue the external lid of a jelly jar to the internal roof of your shed. Just reach up and unscrew the jar lid to access the contents.\nAvoid nailing through the roof as this will ruin the water seal. You can also nail or screw jars to the underside of shelves.\nClear jars help you see what’s inside.\nGlue old cans or short sections of water pipe to the walls to make easy storage for small items like gardening gloves.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Organize a Messy Garden Shed Step 8Bullet4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Organize-a-Messy-Garden-Shed-Step-8Bullet4.jpg/aid5063184-v4-728px-Organize-a-Messy-Garden-Shed-Step-8Bullet4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nCut the spout and the top few inches off an old plastic milk jug.

Perhaps you are storing chemicals in your shed such as weed killer, pesticides, or white spirits.\n\n\nYou might also be storing petrol, diesel, oil or paints: all of these things are toxic.\nSome of these items are flammable; others like petrol can give off very noxious fumes, especially in a confined space like a shed.\nIt’s very important that none of these chemicals are allowed to contaminate the water supply or the ground.",
                "Store your chemicals properly to stay safe. If you have any of the aforementioned chemicals in your shed, you can take some steps to ensure that they are stored properly. Here’s some basic advice for storage of chemicals in your shed:\n\n\nAlways keep chemicals in the original container.\nStore substances such as petrol in containers intended for that purpose. Petrol is corrosive and can wear away at containers not designed for storing petrol, leaking into water and ground and causing a hazard.\nStore chemicals out of reach of pets and children, in a cool dry place out of sunlight.\nOnly buy as much as you need for the year.\nChemicals in powder form should be stored away from, or above, liquids to stop drips and leaks that can cause chemical reactions.\nAvoid keeping chemicals past their expiry date.\nDispose of chemicals safely and never down drains or into water."

            "steps": [
                "Try a benzoyl peroxide cream or cleanser. Benzoyl peroxide is a popular product in acne products. It kills the acne-causing bacteria and helps to open up your pores, so applying it around your nose will help get rid of the acne. Look for products that contain benzoyl peroxide, which can be in concentrations of 2.5% to 10%. Products include cleansers or spot treatments.[1]\n\nBenzoyl peroxide may dry out your skin or cause stinging, burning, and redness at the site of application. Use it only as directed on the package.",
                "Use an acne product with salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is another acne medication. You can find salicylic acid in over-the-counter cleansers and spot treatments to use for your nose acne. Available products contain between 0.5% to 5% concentration of salicylic acid.[2]\n\nSalicylic acid can include skin irritation and stinging. Use only as directed.",
                "Try an over-the-counter retinoid product. Differin gel (adapalene) is a retinoid gel that is available without a prescription It is especially good at opening pores and treating and preventing blackheads, which are common in nose acne. Note that retinoids can be irritating and dry out your skin, especially when you first begin treatment. Make sure you follow the instructions on the packaging and use as directed.",
                "Wash your face daily. To help prevent acne on your nose and the rest of your face, wash your face daily, twice a day if you can. You should also wash after any sweaty activity. A lot of sweat can increase acne.[3]\n\nWash your face gently with light circular motions. Don't wash your face too much. More than twice a day is not recommended.",
                "Try pore strips. You can apply a pore strip to your nose after washing your face, then allow the strip to dry and harden. As the strip dries, the comedonal plugs (dirt in your pores) are attracted to the adhesive on the strip. When you remove the strip, you will see small pieces of dirt stuck to the strip that have come out of your pores.[4]\n\nYou have to apply the strip to wet, clean skin or it will not work properly.\nMake sure that you wait until the strip is completely dry to remove it. Then pull it off slowly.",
                "Use makeup that won't cause acne. Some cosmetics can irritate your skin and cause acne. If you have trouble with acne on your nose, consider going without makeup or use as little makeup as possible. When choosing foundations, go for oil-free and noncomedogenic makeups that won't clog your pores.[5]\n\nThe chemicals and oils in makeup, even hypoallergenic makeup, can be clog your pores and cause breakouts.\nAlways remove all makeup before going to sleep. This helps reduce clogged pores.",
                "Wear sunblock on your face. You should make sure to protect your face, especially your nose, from the sun. Too much sun exposure and tanning beds can damage your skin, and damaged skin is at a high risk for acne. If you are going to be out in the sun, wear sunblock. You can choose to wear a separate sunscreen or buy a daily moisturizer with sunblock in it.[6]\n\nSome acne medications make your skin extremely sensitive to UV rays. Take caution in the sun if you are using these medications, which list sensitivity to the sun on the labels.",
                "See a doctor. Try these at home methods for at least three to four weeks. If the acne on your nose is showing no improvement, make an appointment to see a dermatologist. If you have moderate to severe acne, see a dermatologist before you try any of these methods to get a professional recommendation.\n\n\nWithout that professional advice, you could cause more problems than you solve/ Your dermatologist may recommend other approaches to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples on your nose. Nothing can replace having a trained physician physically examine and look at your unique skin.\nA dermatologist may recommend prescription medications, or alternative treatments such as microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or light or laser treatments. They may also help immediately remove blackheads with a special tool called a comedone extractor.",
                "Choose a noncomedogenic cleanser. A noncomedogenic cleanser will not clog your pores. This kind of cleanser is recommended if your face is prone to acne. Choose a mild, non-abrasive cleanser.\n\n\nTry a gentle, water-based cleanser such as Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Eucerin. These are especially helpful if you have oily skin.",
                "Cleanse your face. Wet your face with lukewarm water and then pour a small amount of the cleanser into the palm of your hand. Massage the cleanser onto your face for about two minutes. Make sure to use small, gentle, circular motions.[7]\n\nTo help get rid of nose acne, pay special attention to your nose and all its curves. Get the cleanser into creases of your nose.",
                "Rinse off the cleanser. Next, splash your face with lukewarm water or use a washcloth soaked in warm water to remove the cleanser from your face. Keep splashing your face with water or rinse the washcloth in warm water and repeat until you have wiped all the cleanser off your face.\n\n\nAvoid scrubbing your skin. This can lead to irritation, redness, and breakouts.[8]\n\nUse a cotton towel to pat dry your face after you have removed all of the cleanser.",
                "Moisturize your face. Apply a noncomedogenic moisturizer, such as products from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Olay. You can also try store brand moisturizers, but make sure you read the label to check that it is noncomedogenic.\n\n\nUse this method twice a day and after heavy sweating.[9]",
                "Use a spot herbal treatment. A number of herbs can act as astringents, which help to dry out tissues and act as anti-inflammatory agents. You can apply an astringent directly onto pimples on your nose using a Q-tip or a cotton ball. Use these astringents sparingly because they dry out the skin. The following herbal astringents can be used to dry individual pimples:\n\n\nBlack or Green tea[10]\n\nLemon juice\nChamomile tea[11]\n\nYarrow tea\nSage tea\nApple cider vinegar[12]",
                "Make an herbal mask. Facial masks can help clean, tighten, and heal the skin and minimize pimples. Astringent herbs tighten or tone the skin while the antibacterial herbs help kill off bacteria. You can treat just your nose or your entire face. Start by making a mask with one tablespoon of honey, which is antibacterial and astringent, along with one egg white, which is also an astringent.[13][14]\n\nAdd one teaspoon of lemon juice, which is another astringent.\nAdd ⅛ teaspoon of any of the following essential oils with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties: peppermint, spearmint, lavender, calendula, or thyme.\nSpread the mixture over your nose. If you want, use a q-tip to spread the mixture over specific problem areas. Allow the mixture to dry for 15 minutes, then rinse off completely with lukewarm water.\nPat dry and apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer.",
                "Use a sea salt mask. You can also dry out pimples on the nose by using sea salt. Take one teaspoon of sea salt and stir it into three teaspoons of hot water. Stir to dissolve the sea salt. if you don’t want to use a full mask, take a q-tip and dip the tip into your mixture and apply where needed. Just make sure you avoid getting the mixture near your eyes.[15]\n\nLeave the mixture on for 10 minutes. Don’t leave it on any longer. Sea salt draws water out and can dry your skin too much.\nRinse off completely with cool or lukewarm water. Pat dry.",
                "Make an exfoliant. Vigorous exfoliation using a harsh exfoliant product often does more harm than good. Exfoliation can cause micro-scarring and more obvious scarring, and it can often make acne worse. The scrubs you buy which perform the exfoliation may pull off skin that is not yet ready to fall off. Instead, you can make your own gentle exfoliants to spot treat the acne on your nose. Use these treatments two to three times a week.[16][17]\n\nTo make a honey-baking soda exfoliant, mix ¼ cup of honey with enough baking soda to make a paste. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected area. You can also use a q-tip. Gently work the mixture into your nose for two to three minutes and rinse with warm water.\nGrind ¼ to ½ cup of rolled whole oats in a food processor. Add enough olive, jojoba, vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil to make a paste. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas or use a q-tip. Gently work the mixture into the area for two to three minutes and rinse with warm water.\nFor a sugar-olive oil exfoliant, mix a teaspoon of sugar with ½ cup of olive oil. Using gentle, circular motions, apply this mixture to the affected areas or use a q-tip. Gently work the mixture into the area for two to three minutes and rinse with warm water.",
                "Wash your face. Before you steam clean your face, you need to clean it first. Otherwise, you might cause even more pimples. Wet your face with lukewarm water. With your fingertips, apply cleanser to your face.\n\n\nRinse your face with lukewarm water. Make sure to remove all the excess cleanser. Pat dry using a clean towel.",
                "Choose an essential oil. You can add an acne-fighting essential oil to your steam. This can give your nose some extra cleansing. You can try tea tree oil, orange oil, lavender oil, rosemary oil, or peppermint oil.\n\n\nYou may want to use the same oil that is in your cleanser or try a different oil completely.",
                "Fill a bowl with steaming water. Heat one quart of water until it boils. When the water starts to boil, remove it from the heat. Then, pour the water into a heat proof bowl and add a few drops of your chosen essential oil.[18]\n\nIf you don’t have any essential oils, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of the dried herb for each quart of water.",
                "Hold your face over the steam. Opening your pores using steam can help clear your skin and help the astringents effectively dry out the pimples on your nose To steam your face, begin by covering your head with a large towel. When the water has cooled a bit but is still steaming, hold your face over the steaming pot. Make sure to stay at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) above it.[19]\n\nClose your eyes. Remain over the steam for 10 minutes with the towel over your head. This helps open your pores.\nNever put your face too close to hot water. This can cause scalding and damage blood vessels.",
                "Repeat this process. After 10 minutes, remove your face from the steam. Cover your face with a cold washcloth. After holding the cold cloth on your face for 30 seconds, return to the steam. Repeat this 3 times, ending with the cold treatment each time.\n\n\nThe idea is to contract and expand surface capillaries, which can tone your skin and improve circulation.",
                "Rinse and dry. When you are finished, rinse your face with lukewarm water. Gently pat your face dry without rubbing your skin. Then, apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to your face.[20]\n\nYou can do this steam treatment twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, to try to get rid of the acne around your nose."

        "How to Give Dawah": {
            "intro": "Giving Dawah — inviting people who are non-Muslims or drifting away from Islam to Islam — is an important task and part of practicing Amr Bil Ma’ruf Wan-Nahyi Anil-Munkar (calling to good and forbidding the evil). However, the actual job of teaching and preaching Islam is not for the unqualified and uneducated. Proper training and experience is needed to give Dawah. So, how can you effectively and properly give Dawah?",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure you have the right intentions before giving Dawah. You should have pure and good intentions. Oftentimes, many Muslims decide to tell the world about Islam but do it in a way that causes more damage than good, putting themselves in unfortunate situations.\n\n\nDon't give Dawah if your intention is to show off that you are a very knowledgeable person; make sure your intention is to please Allah[1].\nGiving Dawah is essentially a special mission to invite people to worship Allah according to the way that He wants to be worshiped. You are delivering a message of truth and showing others how to follow it.\nThe purpose of Dawah is not only to spread the knowledge of Islam but to grow closer to Allah yourself. Take the act of inviting others to Islam as a way to bring yourself closer to Islam as well.",
                "Take a short Dawah course to learn how to give Dawah to a variety of different individuals. You can often find organizations or community groups that come together to teach about Dawah. Most of these courses are free.\n\n\nSome organizations, like Mission Dawah, offer online training or training apps. You can find courses that come in audio, video, or written format for your convenience.\nConferences dedicated to teaching how to give Dawah are often held, so be on a lookout in your local area for those. There, you can meet others wishing to give Dawah and learn from educated and experienced teachers and preachers.",
                "Learn how to answer frequently asked questions about Islam. If a Dawah course is not doable for you, there are many materials and resources that talk about common questions people may ask about Islam and how to answer them. Search local Islamic centres for books or the internet to learn what others are asking about Islam. Some questions you might be asked are:\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the words Islam and Muslim?[2]\n\nWho is Allah?[3]\n\nWho is the Prophet Muhammad? And why do Muslims believe he is the last prophet?[4]\n\nWhat do Muslims believe about Jesus?\nWhat does Islam say about homosexuality, abortion, and marriage?[5]",
                "Integrate Islam into your life as much as possible. This means you live and breathe Islam both mentally and physically. You should continue to present yourself as a Muslim as well as bring Islam material into your daily interactions and environments.\n\n\nMaintain the physical appearance of a believer by growing and maintaining a beard and wearing your hijab.\nBring Islamic materials to your workplace or where ever you go. This makes giving Dawah easier, as it may spark conversations or questions from others.\nBring halal meat to your workplace and share them to others to generate conversations.\nPray at your workplace or wherever you are. Let people know prayer is very important to you. You may need to arrange a place or room with your employer and employees in order to pray.",
                "Pray to God and ask for guidance and a sound mind for you to be able to share your faith according to His holy will. For God to answer your prayers, you must live a righteous life and repent any unlawful things you may have done.\n\n\nTruthfulness is one of the most important qualities to have when calling people to Islam. Having this mindset will lead you closer to Allah and also prepare you better for Dawah.",
                "Begin by getting to know the person. Talk to them about themselves, their family, their work, and show that you genuinely care about them. Each person is unique and getting to know them will help you plan the best way to give Dawah to them.\n\n\nTry to find out as much as you can what they know about Islam. Some good opening questions are: How did you first hear about Islam? What do you know about Islam? Or bring up some recent news involving Islam.\nDo not speak too much about Islam at one time -- let them set the pace. It is best to give Dawah in small doses. Depending on who you are talking to, you can continue the conversation or give literature for them to go through on their own. Giving Dawah is about simplicity.[6]\n\nJust be friends with them. Sometimes introducing or reminding someone of the Islam faith is just to be a good friend and show through example. This is especially effective if you know of a Muslim that is straying from Islam.",
                "Ask them if there is anything they do not understand about Islam. You can ask, \"What do you think is wrong with Islam?\" or \"What do you think Islam is?\" Then clear each misconception with as much knowledge and clarity as you can offer. Or point them to the right direction to obtain these answers.\n\n\nMany people will have confused Islam traditions and teachings with ideas that they are already familiar with outside of Islam. For example, people who are familiar with the Christian Bible and its many interpretations may draw the same interpretations when they hear that the Quran mentions Adam and Eve. Some believe that, because of the Bible, society sees women as lesser than men and then have the misconception that women are also oppressed or dominated by men in Islam. Point them towards the Quran and outline the differences between the Quran and the Bible and what these differences mean.\nIn the media and popular culture, many Islamic traditions are the subject of heated debates. The hijab worn by Muslim women is a popular debated topic. You should clarify these misconceptions and lead them to view these concepts of Islam in the framework of Islamic thought which sees the wearing of the hijab as honouring purity of both thought and body.",
                "Say thank you. Thank the person for giving you the chance to share about Islam to them. You might even want to try saying thank you if someone asks you a rude question or insults Islam, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. By saying thank you in response to abusive statements, you show others that Islam is, indeed, a good faith. It may also surprise them and make them more open to listen to you.\n\n\nFor example, someone might ask, \"Why do Muslim women cover their heads? Isn't this a sign of subjection of women?\"[7] Tell them, \"Thank you for asking me about my religion\" and continue with \"You have an interesting question concerning Islam and I congratulate you for seeking correct knowledge about our faith.\"",
                "Be polite and don't argue or debate with who you are giving Dawah to. Arguing and debating is against the teachings by Allah in the Quran; \"He who gave up disputing while he is right, a palace of high rank in Paradise will be built for him\" (At Tirmidhi). Although your intentions may be good, arguing could lead to disputes and it is best to spread the knowledge in a peaceful way. In Islam, backing down is better than debating.\n\n\nStop looking for \"loop holes\" in others' beliefs or putting them down for their beliefs. Belittling others is against the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.\nBe more inviting and less defensive. Being defensive or argumentative pushes people away from Islam. It may also hurt people such as your family or friends and even you, bringing in frustration caused by these disputes. In the end, God knows your intentions and will work his will.",
                "Speak the truth. Islam believes that truthfulness is one of the pillars the world's survival depends on. Since speech or speaking is an exclusive human trait, lying is seen as losing your humanity. So when giving Dawah, not only is it important that you do not lie, but also preach that you cannot lie and the faith of Islam is all about truth. You can give examples from the Quran and Sunnah of what lying means and what its consequences are.\n\n\nSome examples of lying are lying when buying and selling, lying about visions and dreams, telling lies as jokes, or being hypocritical.[8] Allah also warns against speaking about everything you hear as you may hear both truths and lies, and speaking about everything could count as lying.\nDo not tell lies about Allah and His Messengers: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1229.[9]\n\nWhen you make a statement about Islam, justify it and reference the Quran or Hadith if necessary.\nIf you do not know the answer to a question, say \"I don't know\". Don't lie about your knowledge or spread misinformation. The best way to go about this is to be truthful and direct the person to another source that may contain an answer to their question.",
                "Don't worry if non-Muslims do not accept Islam. The purpose of Dawah is not to convert or convince others to Islam. The decision should be made by the person's own free will.You're duty is to convey the message of truth. Allah guides whom He wills.\n\n\nAsk them, even if they do not accept Islam, what they think of Islam now. This can aid you in future attempts at Dawah or even continue the conversation.",
                "Hand out materials such as a CD, book, or brochure of other more experienced Da'ee (caller of Islam). One of the easiest ways to give Dawah is to spread the message through another Da'ee, especially if you are still working on acquiring knowledge.\n\n\nYou can also give a translated version of the Quran. The Quran is your most effective tool in telling others about Islam, as it is the most powerful book at your disposal.\nGive out leaflets or brochures of upcoming conferences to people or to your local Islamic centre.\nIf you plan to do Dawah in public to strangers, giving material is the best way to engage others in conversation.",
                "Do charity work to help others and also show how Islam has affected your life. Get involved in your local area by helping the old or disadvantaged, or with organizations that help with the environment, community, animals, and much more.\n\n\nEngaging in charity work or sadaqah is a very important virtuous deed in Islam and shows Allah and others your faith in Islam. There are no preliminary requirements in order to give sadaqah and you can should give it freely without any limits or expect anything back.[10]\n\nPeople touched by your charity work will most likely have a more open mind about you and Islam. This makes the message of Islam much easier for others to accept.",
                "Provide materials to your Islamic community by recording lectures, or posting videos. This is especially needed if your community is lacking materials to give to members who have strayed from Islam or cannot attend meetings regularly. It will also bring you closer to others in your local community.\n\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad encourages that knowledge be shared and not withheld. There will be people in your community that are not willing to share the knowledge.[11]\n\nDo non-direct dawah by using the internet. For example, post Islamic tweets on Twitter."

            "intro": "Managing your personal hygiene is important not only to look and smell your best on a daily basis, but also to prevent the onset and spread of infectious diseases. Taking the proper precautions can help you avoid getting sick and passing illnesses on to those around you. Read this article to learn how to manage personal hygiene to both improve your overall appearance and ward off infections.",
            "steps": [
                "Shower daily. This is the best way to get rid of any dirt, sweat, and/or germs that your body may have accumulated throughout the day, and prevents hygiene-related diseases.[1] As a plus, showering daily helps you feel, look, and smell your best throughout the day.\n\n\nUse a loofah, sponge, or hand towel to gently scrub your entire body, removing dead skin cells and dirt. Remember to replace these items regularly as they can easily harbor bacteria.\nIf you don't want to wash your hair every day, then invest in a shower cap and wash your body with soap and water.\nIf you don't have time to shower, then use a hand towel to rinse your face and underarms at the end of the day.",
                "Choose a daily face cleanser. Remember that the skin on your face is more sensitive than on other parts of your body. You can either use your face cleanser in the shower or wash your face separately at the sink.\n\n\nTake your skin type into account when choosing a face cleaner. If you have very dry skin, avoid products that has high alcohol content, as this will further dry out your skin. If you have very sensitive skin, opt for hypo-allergenic products that contain less harsh chemicals.\nIf you wear a lot of makeup, find a cleanser that also specializes in removing makeup. Otherwise, buy a separate makeup remover and remove all makeup before washing your face at the end of the day.",
                "Brush your teeth every morning and evening. Regular tooth-brushing helps prevent gum disease, which has been linked to other illnesses elsewhere in the body like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.[2] It is especially important to brush teeth after eating sweets or acidic foods that cause tooth erosion.\n\n\nTo keep your gums extra strong, carry around a travel-sized toothbrush and toothpaste and brush your teeth in between meals.\nFloss your teeth every night to prevent the gum disease gingivitis.",
                "Wear deodorant. Antiperspirant helps control excessive sweat, while deodorant covers up unpleasant body odor caused by sweat. Consider using a natural, aluminum-free deodorant to reduce potential health risks associated with conventional deodorants.[3]\n\nIf you choose not to wear deodorant on a daily basis, then consider wearing it on the days when you plan on sweating excessively, or for special occasions. Apply deodorant before playing sports, going to the gym, or attending a formal occasion.\nIf you don't wear deodorant, then rinse your underarms with soap and water throughout the day to remove unpleasant odor.",
                "Wash your clothes after wearing them. In general, shirts should be washed after every use, while pants and shorts can be worn a few times before they require washing. Use your best judgment to determine how often to wash your clothes.\n\n\nRemove any stains from your clothing before wearing them.\nIron out wrinkles, and use a lint-remover to remove unwanted lint and hair from clothing.",
                "Trim your hair every 4-8 weeks. Whether you're trying to grow your hair out or prefer to keep it short, trimming it will keep hair healthy, get rid of split ends, and give an overall cleaner, healthier appearance.",
                "Clip your fingernails and toenails regularly. Not only will this keep your hands and feet looking their best, it will prevent hangnails, breakage, and other potential damage to your nails. Short nails can't trap dirt under them the way long nails do. How often you clip your fingernails will depend on your personal desired length. To decide, take into account what you use your hands for on a daily basis. If you spend a lot of time typing on a computer or playing the piano, for example, short nails are probably the best option for you. If you prefer longer nails, that's fine too, but be sure to trim them every so often to prevent breakage.\n\n\nUse an orange stick to remove dirt from underneath the fingernails to prevent bacterial infections.",
                "Wash your hands with soap and water. This is one of the most important ways to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.[4] Wash your hands after using the restroom; before, during, and after preparing food; before eating food; before and after caring for someone who is sick; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling animals and/or animal waste.\n\n\nConsider keeping a hand sanitizer with you at all times in case you can't reach a bathroom to wash your hands.",
                "Clean the surfaces in your home regularly. You should wipe the kitchen counter, floors, shower, and dining tables at least once a week using either soap and water or conventional household cleaning products. If you live with other people, consider coming up with a system of chores and alternate cleaning jobs every week.\n\n\nConsider using eco-friendly cleaning products that contain less harsh chemicals than the conventional brands.\nAlways wipe your shoes on a doormat before entering the home. Consider taking your shoes off and leaving them at the door before entering the home, and asking guests to do the same. This will prevent the spread of dirt and mud throughout the house.",
                "Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. This is extremely important if you want to avoid spreading germs to those around you. Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water after you cough or sneeze.",
                "Don't share razors, towels, or makeup with other people. Sharing personal items like these with other people increases the likelihood of spreading Staph infections.[5] If you do share towels or clothing, be sure to wash them both before and after lending them to others.",
                "If you are a woman change your tampon/pad regularly. Women who use tampons should change them at least once every 4-6 hours to reduce the likelihood of getting toxic shock syndrome (TSS).[6] Women who use pads should change them every 4-8 hours. If you plan on sleeping more than eight hours, then wear an overnight pad instead of a tampon while you sleep.",
                "Keep up with doctor's visits. Seeing your doctor regularly can help catch illnesses and infections early, making it much easier to treat them. Visit your primary care physician, dentist, gynecologist, cardiologist, or any other physician you may be seeing on a regular basis. Visit your doctor when you are feeling sick or think you may have an infection, and be sure to keep up with routine check-ups."

        "wikiHow to Overcome Loneliness When Surrounded by People": {
            "intro": "Loneliness is one of the most challenging feelings to overcome. For those of us that suffer from loneliness, it is emotionally crippling and can lead us into depression. In fact, the most frustrating part of loneliness is that even though we might be surrounded by people, we still feel alone and disconnected. Luckily, though, there are many things we can do to overcome loneliness. Don’t give up, there are people who care about you. You will be able to get through your loneliness if you stick with it.[1][2]",
            "steps": [
                "Recognize that being lonely and being alone are two different things. Being lonely is a feeling that transcends your outward environment and current social activities. While someone can be surrounded by people in a crowd and still feel lonely, someone else might be all alone and not feel lonely at all.\n\n\nLoneliness is a feeling of disconnectedness you have inside.\nBeing alone is when no one is around you.\nYou can be surrounded by people and still feel lonely.[3]",
                "Try to better understand your loneliness. Think about your likes, dislikes, and where you feel comfortable. You might feel lonely in certain crowds, but you might feel deep connections with people at small gatherings. The only way to move forward is to find out exactly what situations you are uncomfortable in. Consider the special circumstances of your unease and loneliness.\n\n\nDo you like small gatherings of friends?\nHow do you feel in bars, clubs, or other social events where you’re out in a public establishment?\nDo you feel okay in large gatherings if you know everyone?[4]",
                "Examine your past. There might be hurtful experiences in your past that contribute to why you feel so lonely. One of the first places you should start is by examining yourself to figure out if this is true. If so, you’ll have a better idea of why you feel this way and you’ll be able to move forward.\n\n\nMaybe you were abused or neglected by the people who were supposed to take care of you.\nMaybe you were bullied or left out by your classmates.\nMaybe you are feeling inadequate because of physical or mental disabilities, your gender, race or social background.[5]",
                "Seek help from a professional. Find a mental health professional to talk about your feelings. A psychiatrist, counselor, social worker, or psychologist can help you examine your past and determine what might be causing your loneliness and discomfort. This might be one of the last things you want to do, but if loneliness is crippling you emotionally and detracting from your quality of life, you should consider seeking help.[6]\n\nThrough therapy, you can acquire new tools, skills, and outlets to help you feel better. Counseling can also provide you with some much needed support.",
                "Be true to yourself. Don’t let the urge to conform to other people’s expectations make you into a different person. Focus on your inner-self rather than on outer stimuli and influences. Be proud of the person you are, and more people will want to connect with you.\n\n\nTell yourself that your own opinions are important.\nConstantly reinforce your own uniqueness and personality.\nDon’t fear being different just so others approve of you.[7]",
                "Open up to close friends or relatives. Pick a really close friend or relative and talk to them about your problem. You’ll find that people who care about you will go out of their way to make you feel better, feel supported, and feel more connected. After all, having a solid support system is one of the most important things in feeling connected to the people around you.\n\n\nYour friend or relative will know how you feel and might be more understanding if you’re in a situation where you feel lonely.\nThey might offer advice or perspective on how you feel.\nThey’ll try to make you feel loved and supported.[8]",
                "Find others like you. One reason you might be lonely in a crowd is that you’re surrounded by people who are extroverts, much more social than you, or even share drastically different worldviews or interests. A good way to overcome this is to find others like yourself with whom you can relate and socialize. Try to:\n\n\nTalk to many different people briefly in order to find people more like yourself.\nMaster the art of the quick interview. Try asking people about where they grew up, where they live, where they went to school, or what they do for a living. These are easy ways of finding people you share something in common with.\nDon’t trap yourself in the idea that no one is like you.[9]",
                "Listen to others. Sometimes our loneliness is compounded by the fact that we feel too stressed and too drained talking and entertaining others. Instead, try to listen to others. Many people who are extroverts and like to socialize also like to talk about themselves. View this as an opportunity. They’ll enjoy you listening to them, and you’ll create your own niche as someone who listens to others.[10]",
                "Master the art of conversation. Practice conversing with different people and getting yourself used to socializing. This way, when you’re in a crowd, you’ll be more at ease when it comes to talking to people and forming connections.\n\n\nTalk to people about things you have in common, like where you grew up, schools you went to, or friends you share in common.\nTalk to people about current events like the weather, sports, or things happening in your community.\nAvoid steering a conversation toward your own interests at the expense of others.[11]",
                "Force yourself to socialize. You might be lonely in a crowd because you’re not used to socializing in large groups. One way to overcome this is to make yourself socialize. Practice makes perfect. The more you socialize, the easier it’ll be, and the more comfortable you’ll be talking to other people and making friends.\n\n\nFocus on deep conversations, rather than chit-chat and superficial discussion. If appropriate, ask people what they think about something you are interested in.\nSocialize with people you know and care about.\nStart in environments you feel comfortable in.[12]",
                "Understand that it's the quality of friend that matters, not quantity. Remember that just because you have a lot of friends or are in a crowd, doesn’t mean that lots of people will cure your feeling of loneliness. Use being in a crowd to meet different people and identify people you can form quality relationships with.[13]",
                "Avoid people who make you feel bad. Sometimes we feel lonely or alienated from a group because of the people we’re around – sometimes we view them as friends – are mean to us, make fun of us, or are not supportive of us. Don’t spend time with these people. Leave the group and find another group of people (or individuals) who do appreciate you for being you, who are positive, and who are supportive.[14]",
                "Surround yourself with friends. Identifying good friends and enjoying their company in a crowd or at a party is important to not being lonely in a crowd. Your friends will not only offer you support and make you feel connected to the crowd, but they can act as a bridge to meeting new people.[15]",
                "Be persistent when it comes to finding people you like to associate with. If you don’t connect with one individual or group, look for others. Don’t give up. There are a lot of different people out there. You might find that you feel completely out of place with one group, but totally connect with another group.[16]",
                "Embrace the fact that everyone is different, and enjoy it. Sometimes you might not be able to find others who are like you. Instead of withdrawing into yourself, try to view this as a good thing and try to get to know people who are much different from yourself.\n\n\nYou’ll potentially grow as a person.\nYou might discover that people you share much in common with people you thought are different than you.\nYou’ll come to appreciate and enjoy diversity and differing opinions much more.[17]",
                "Rise above labels such as being “shy” or “different.” Being shy or different is no reason to feel lonely in a crowd. If you embrace these labels and use them as an excuse for your loneliness, chances are, nothing will ever change. Studies have shown that people often avoid socializing with people who seem to be shy or withdrawn. Instead:\n\n\nTry to see yourself as a social person.\nView being shy as something that you can overcome.\nRealize that there are people like you out there, too.[18]"

        "wikiHow to Deliver a Foal": {
            "intro": "The birth of a foal is always exciting, no matter if you've waited for days on end for your mare to finally foal. If the mare is healthy and she foals in a clean place, there will be no problems. However, if something does go wrong, it is best if you are there to give assistance or to get a veterinarian to help. This article is how to not only be prepared for foaling, but to know what to do if things go wrong.",
            "steps": [
                "Find a place where the mare should foal. This can range from out on pasture or in a small enclosure like a shed, corral or box stall.\n\n\nA foaling stall should be at least 14' by 16' or larger to minimize the risk of the mare lying too close to the wall during her labour.\nIf the mare has to foal in a stall or shed, it must be thoroughly cleaned.\n\nTake out all old bedding and scrub down the entire stall (floor, walls, everything) with disinfectant. Then sprinkle the floor with lime before putting on new bedding.\n\nStraw is best as bedding, because it won't stick to the foal as easily as wood chips or sawdust will, nor will it get into his/her nostrils and get sucked into his/her air passageways, nor get swallowed by the mare when she cleans him/her off.\n\nWood products may carry a bacteria called Klebsiella which can cause uterine infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove all obstacles from the stall, from feed tubs to buckets or anything else that may get in the way of the mare during her labour.\nClean the mare's udder, belly, rear and upper legs or any place that a foal would nuzzle when trying to find the udder, with warm water and chlorhexidine to reduce contamination to the foal.\n\nThis is especially useful if there has been any cases of E. coli and other foal-hood diseases on the farm. Washing her just before foaling also greatly reduces risks of diarrhea and septicimia in the foal.\n\n\nPick up all manure several times a day so the mare has no chance of getting dirty.\nA level grassy pasture is a good place to consider, especially if the mare is foaling during the time of year where the pasture isn't muddy or full of snow or both.\n\nMake sure the pasture is free of brush, rocks, old nails, machinery, ditches or even puddles of water.\n\nFoals have been known to drown in tiny pools of water, and get stuck on their backs in a dry ditch. Foals can even die if they have their backs under a fence and can't get up; mostly because the mare choose to foal right beside the fence.\n\n\nConsider the advantages and disadvantages of foaling out on pasture:\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\nLess risk of infection\nMore natural environment where mare can seek her own privacy and be less upset and nervous\nBetter exercise and muscle tone for the mare\nMore natural bowel movements than a confined mare would have on grass hay and grain because she won't be as constipated when giving birth.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nDifficult for you to keep constant watch on her\nFoaling on pasture not advisable in bad weather or in winter.",
                "Be prepared if the mare decides to foal early. Usually mares that foal for the first time may start labour earlier than those mares that are more experienced.\n\n\nMares that foal in the spring or summer may have a shorter gestation period than those who foal in winter months (January, February or March). Most vets believe that the time of year is the largest factor affecting length of pregnancy in all mares.\nSome mares are set on their own schedules, and this can be more reliable than her age, how many other foals she's had, and the time of year.\nIllness or infection can cause a mare to foal earlier or later than normal, if the fetus has been nutritionally deprived due to poor placental attachment in the uterus.\n\nIf she's 3 or 4 weeks past her due date, have your vet check her out to make sure there's nothing wrong.",
                "Sometimes it may help to get a foaling prediction kit to determine when the mare is really about to foal. Things like test strips for checking the mare's milk before foaling, TV or security cameras installed in the stall to monitor the mare 24/7, Baby Buzzer (Locust Farms, Kirkland OH), the Birth Alarm (Kincardine, ON) or the Foal Alert (Foalert Inc., Acworth, GA) are some things to try out if you don't want to be spending nights in the barn waiting for the mare to pop.",
                "Give the mare privacy. It is best to observe her quietly from a place where she cannot see nor hear you. A mare can get easily upset of people are always hovering around her, and naturally would rather have her foal where it's quiet, secluded and peaceful. This is why most mares like to foal at night.",
                "A month before the mare foals her udder starts looking fuller and larger especially at night when at rest.",
                "Around 2 weeks prior to foaling udder remains larger, filled with milk, and will also look shiny.",
                "A few days before foaling, the muscles on each side of the tail head around the hooks (pelvic bone) sink in. That's because the muscles are relaxing and drooping away from the base of the tail.",
                "The vulva starts to look loose and relaxed and even swollen. Often it will look larger and more floppier than normal.",
                "Secretions from the teats may start.\n\n\nThis is called \"waxing,\" and is often the most common signs that a mare is near, within 24 to 36 hours of foaling. Waxing is a congealing of secretions from the teats that are forced out to the end of the teat. There are always exceptions, though.\n\nSome mares may not even start waxing or bag up until right after birth. Others may have a huge bag for weeks and be waxing for days as well.\n\nThe funny thing is, the most predictable thing about mares is that they're always unpredictable!",
                "Mares that begin labour process will show changes in her attitude or behaviour. She may try to find a place in a far corner away from the rest of the herd, or stand with a faraway look in her eye.\n\n\nShe may also become restless, pacing around, then eating a little, then pacing again.\n\nIf you suspect she's in early labour, check on her every 10 to 15 minutes.",
                "Mild uterine contractions prepare the dam for delivery. The uterine contractions help get the foal positioned properly for birth so the head and front legs are aimed at the birth canal, towards the rear of the dam.\n\n\nPelvic muscles relax more fully, the tail rises, and her sides above her flanks appear more caved in. This is the time that the foal is shifting position.",
                "The dam will be more nervous and restless than initially in during the early labour stage.",
                "As active labor comes about, the mare will be switching her tail, pacing more, pawing, or nosing at her flank.\n\n\nThis is the time to bandage up her tail, using a clean bandage or nylon stocking or pantyhose to prevent the foal from picking up dirt on his way out of the birth canal.\nAlso supply fresh bedding (making sure it's soft and deep enough for her and her foal) and, if there's time, gently washing her teats, udder legs and buttocks with soap and water and a mild disinfectant if they're dirty.\n\nLeave her be, but still keep checking on her (without her seeing or hearing you).",
                "The mare may be getting up and down once the contractions come faster and more intensively. She may give birth laying on her side, or up on her feet, depending on how she feels.",
                "The water sac will appear first, amber-coloured. The sac may have burst inside her, with instead amber-coloured liquid streaming out from her vulva.",
                "The birth of the foal usually doesn't take long, often within 5 to 30 minutes after the last stage of early labor began and the water bag showed.\n\n\n\nCows can safely be in active labour for longer than 20 to 30 minutes but it's different for a mare. If she's taking longer than 30 minutes to foal, assistance is needed immediately.\n\nMares at this point are pushing so strongly that they can kill their foals or push only part of it through her uterus.\n\nEither the foal is presented wrong (dystocia), or it's too big and not coming through the birth canal readily.\n\n\n\n\nFoals in normal presentation come front-fee-head first. A clear whitish membrane filled with fluid will appear then in a moment, the feet should be visible within.\nThe foal's nose should appear tucked between them.\nUsually the feet are not even; this is because foals often come through the birth canal one shoulder at a time.\nOnce the shoulders come, then the rest will follow.",
                "For large foals or hard birth,s you will need to pull the foal, if you can. If the large foal is presented normally but unable to fully get through the birth canal, loop obstetrical/calving chains on the foals forelegs, and pull with the contractions.\n\n\nPull out and down (if she's standing), or out and toward the mare's hocks, keeping in line with the birth canal.\n\nIf it's an exceptionally hard pull, you may need to have one person on each leg of the foal.",
                "Call the veterinarian if you suspect your mare is having trouble foaling due to dystocia.",
                "Get the mare up, if possible. Put a halter on her and pull on her head or tap her hindquarters to encourage her to get up.",
                "Don't wait for the vet to arrive. No matter if it's a simple problem that is easy to correct or a more serious and complicated problem, you will have to try to correct it while you wait for the vet to arrive.\n\n\nMost serious malpresentations will result in a dead foal.",
                "Wash your hands, glove up and lube up. Cleanliness is a priority when handling the birth of foals.",
                "Reach in through the vagina and determine what presentation the foal is in. These are the following types of malpresentations, from the simple to the more complex:\n\n\n\nOne foot turned back: The foot may be flexed at the knee or at the fetlock, and will be easy to correct, by simply pushing on the leg that has already appeared, at the same time pulling on the missing one. If you can't find the missing foot, however, you will need vet assistance or try to get it back up yourself.\n\nWash up and lube up again, then go in and push the foal's nose back into the uterus and try to reach farther in to find the missing leg. Once you have gotten the leg flexed up enough that you can grasp the hoof with your hand, cup the hoof in your hand and bring it in and up so that it is under the foal's neck and over the pelvic rim.\n\nOnce the foal's back to normal, you can start pulling on the foals legs. Check and double check that the nose is in the right place and not pushed back too far.\n\n\n\n\n\nNose but no feet: Usually a foal in this position is one that is already dead. Push the foal back in the uterus far enough that you can manipulate both legs into the birth canal. Then pull the foal out.\n\nHead turned back: Only attempt this if your vet cannot get there within the next 20 minutes. Push the foal back into the uterus with one hand and find the head with the other. The head may be turned back or down to one side. Try to get hold of the lower jaw and pull the head up into position. Often foals with this malpresentation die by the time they come out.\n\nBelly presentation (Three or Four Feet at Once): This is a rare condition, and may only be discovered until you've already started pulling on the foal, thinking it is just a large foal. This type of dystocia is pretty well impossible to correct. A Caesarean section may be the only option to get this foal out, or if it's already dead, the vet will have to cut the foal in pieces.\n\nRotated transverse foal: This position, though rare (but more of a problem in draft mares) is where the foal is upside down and the head is turned back, often twisting in and upwards so much so that it is impossible to correct. Each part of the foal's body is also often in the uterus. The uterus can be tipped so that the foal cannot be reached from the birth canal. A C-section is the only way to safely deliver this foal.\n\nBackward presentation: The foal can still be delivered, but more quickly so that he won't suffocate or inhale any of the surrounding fluid before he's completely out. You need at least two people to help you with this: one to hold the mare up, and another or two to help pull out the foal. Put OB chains on the rear legs of the foal, one half-hitch above the fetlocks and another below the hock joints, and pull with all your strength when the mare strains. Don't stop when the mare stops, as you need to get this foal out as quickly as possible to have it come alive. Get him breathing as soon as possible once he's out.\n\nBreech: This presentation is much worse than a normal backwards presentation. This is because nothing protrudes as the mare is in labour, and when you reach in, all you feel is rump and tail. You need to get both back feet up so that you can get the foal out. To do this you will need to try to reach the hock and flex it as much as possible. Reach for the cannon bone and slide your hand to the foot. Cup the foot in the palm of your hand and bring it up over the pelvis into the birth canal. Repeat with the other leg and foot. Then follow the procedure above for delivering a backward foal.\n\nIf the feet cannot be reached either by you or the vet, a C-section will be necessary to deliver the foal.\n\n\nPlacenta previa is a condition where the placenta detaches too early and appears first before the foal. You will see a dark red mass coming out instead of the clear white amniotic sac. You will need to break through the thick membrane with your hands to get to the foal, then reaching into the birth canal to get a hold of the foal's legs and quickly pull him out.",
                "The sooner you get the foal out, the better!",
                "In normal unassisted births, a foal born live will break the sac on his own when he shakes his head. If the membrane has not broken around his head, break it and make sure he's breathing.",
                "Get the foal breathing as quick as you can, clearing mucus away from his nose with a suction bulb. You may have to hold him upside down for a few seconds to get the fluid out. Tickle his nostril with a clean piece of straw if that doesn't work. Or, slap his ribcage if even that won't work. You can even try positioning him so that he's sitting on his chest and his head and chin is resting on the ground, allowing the fluid to run out. If any of those methods won't work, give artificial respiration to get him going.\n\n\nArtificial respiration is done by cupping your hands firmly over his mouth and nose and breathing into his one nostril steadily and gently, letting his chest rise, then fall, then breathing in again. Keep going until he can breathe on his own.",
                "Once new momma and baby are delivered and the foal is breathing normally, leave them alone. The mare will lie there for around 10 to 20 minutes before she gets back up and starts cleaning off her new baby.\n\n\nA few minutes of rest is Nature's way of making sure the foal gets his full blood supply from the placenta before the mare gets up and tears the umbilical cord.",
                "Disinfect the navel stump with iodine. With a small jar of iodine, immerse the cord completely without spilling any on the foal.",
                "The afterbirth should soon follow 15 to 45 minutes later after birth, sometimes taking around 2 hours to be completely shed.\n\n\nIf it takes longer than a couple hours for the mare to expel the placenta, call your vet immediately.\n\nNEVER try to remove the afterbirth from the mare, as this could lead to serious uterine infection.",
                "Bag up the afterbirth immediately, then spread it out on a table to let it dry and have a look at it to see if it's intact and a health coloration or not. It should look like a pair of trousers that has one leg smaller than the other (with the ends of the legs closed), and only one tear at the \"waist\" where the foal came through.\n\n\nIf any part of the placenta is missing, it'll usually be the tip of one of the \"trouser legs.\"\nIf the placenta weighs more than 15 lb, it is abnormal and may be diseased, something that you should get your vet to check out for you.",
                "If all is well and both the mare and her foal are healthy and happy, enjoy watching the foal grow into a healthy new horse!"

        "wikiHow to Overcome Fear of Abandonment": {
            "intro": "The fear of abandonment is common for those who have typically experienced the loss of a parent, caregiver, or loved one through death, divorce, or other traumatizing circumstances. Abandonment fears may also stem from not receiving quality physical or emotional care during childhood. It is normal to be displeased with the thought of a loved one leaving, but when the fear becomes so severe it has a noticeable impact on your or your loved one's life, the phobia should be addressed. Living in a chronic state of anxiety can take a toll on your mental and emotional well-being. You can learn to overcome your fear of abandonment by identifying the cause of your anxiety, working on your own emotional health, and changing negative patterns of behavior.",
            "steps": [
                "Accept your emotions as your responsibility. Recovering from a fear of abandonment requires finding healthy ways to cope with your anxieties. The first step towards finding healthy coping mechanisms is to take responsibility for the way you feel. Even though your emotions might be triggered by other people’s actions, realize that the way you respond to them is up to you.[1]\n\nFor example, if someone insults you and it makes you mad, you have to recognize that, even if the remark was degrading or humiliating, you have a choice about how to react. You can get angry, cry, or storm off. Or, you can search inside yourself and remember that your well-being is not dependent on the opinions of others, then smile and walk away.",
                "Identify your fear. Think about why the idea of being abandoned is so frightening to you. Which particular scenario are you afraid of? If you were abandoned today, what specific emotion would that generate in you? What kind of thoughts would go through your mind? Getting specific about your fear can help you find ways to combat it.[2]\n\nFor example, you might fear that if your partner left you, you would feel unlovable and would never be able to find another relationship.",
                "Stop generalizing. If your fear of abandonment comes from an experience you had in childhood, you may be unconsciously assuming that scenario will play out again. Consider themes from your childhood that may be affecting you today.\n\n\nFor instance, if you were abandoned by your mother or another female caretaker, you might feel like you can’t trust any women to remain in your life. Remind yourself that this is not a rational assumption to make, and that all people behave differently.[3]",
                "Practice fact checking. When your anxieties are running high, fact checking is a useful strategy for regaining control of them. Take a moment to distance yourself from your emotions and question whether your thoughts make objective sense. Consider whether there is a simpler and more straightforward explanation for what’s going on.[4]\n\nFor instance, if your partner hasn’t texted you back in half an hour, your first reaction might be to think, “He’s getting tired of me and doesn’t want to talk to me anymore.” When this happens, ask yourself if that’s really the scenario that makes the most sense. It may be more likely that he’s busy talking to someone else or forgot to turn his phone’s ringer on after a meeting.",
                "Adopt a mindful approach. Mindfulness teaches you to focus on what’s going on in the present instead of what might happen in the future. Pay attention to what you’re feeling in the moment and, instead of immediately acting on it or judging yourself for it, ask yourself why you’re feeling that way. This can help you understand your emotions better and know which ones to pay attention to and which ones to let go.[5]\n\n\nMeditation is a good way to get into the habit of mindfulness. Even as little as five or ten minutes of meditation a day can be helpful in becoming more mindful or your thoughts and emotions.\nTry downloading an app on your phone or watching a guided meditation video on YouTube to get started.",
                "Identify any behaviors that push others away. If you’re afraid of being abandoned, you might frequently act from a place of insecurity. Calling and texting someone multiple times a day, asking someone to spend all their free time with you, and accusing others of planning to leave you are a few examples of insecure behavior. Unfortunately, acting like this can have the unintended consequence of scaring friends and partners away. If these behaviors sound like you, work on finding alternative ways to manage your anxiety.[6]\n\nPracticing mindfulness can help you stop pushing others away. With a mindful perspective, you can examine your motives and choose to avoid impulsive, needy behavior.\nWhen you feel insecure, instead of acting on the emotion, try writing in a journal about why you feel that way. Another good option is to take a walk and think through your feelings.",
                "Question the types of relationships you seek. Many people who are afraid of being abandoned habitually seek out relationships with emotionally unavailable people. If you have a history of abandonment, you may unconsciously select partners who will act in the same way as your parents or previous partners.[7]\n\nConsider whether seeking out more emotionally available partners would help you break the cycle of anxiety and abandonment.\nIf you notice unhealthy patterns in your relationships, it may be helpful to see a therapist. A mental health professional can help you identify the source of these unhealthy patterns and teach you to develop skills that move you towards healthier, balanced relationships.",
                "Build a network of friends. If you’re afraid of abandonment, you might have the tendency to focus intensely on one relationship to the exclusion of others. Forming a strong network of friends can help you stop focusing on just one person and provide you a sense of security.\n\n\nIf one person decides to leave or is unavailable, you will still have other friends to fall back on. Cultivating friendships can also help you practice maintaining healthy relationships.[8]\n\nBuild a strong support system by opening yourself up to the opportunity to find and make friends. Join a new club at school. Take a cooking class. Visit your local park more often. Or, start a volunteer service commitment to connect with people with the same interests as you.",
                "Focus on activities that build your self-esteem. Improving your self-esteem can help you become more emotionally self-sufficient and recover from your fear of abandonment. When you feel good about yourself and your abilities, you won’t need to rely on others for validation or attention.[9]\n\nTo increase your self-esteem, try learning a new skill, volunteering to help others, or working on a personal project that’s important to you.",
                "Reflect on how abandonment impacts you. Experiencing the loss of someone close, or past experiences with neglect and physical, mental, or sexual abuse can be a very traumatic. A person who has experienced any of this is more likely to encounter behavioral and psychological challenges because there is that underlying fear that these events could occur again in their current relationships.[10]\nSome common emotional and behavioral reactions of fear of abandonment include: mood swings and fits of anger, as well as other behaviors that may alienate you from those you hold close.\nOther symptoms may include poor self-esteem, low self-worth, severe anxiety or panic attacks, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and difficulty adapting to change.\nFear of abandonment can also impair the ability to trust others and experience. It may lead to co-dependence and associating with people who reinforce those negative thoughts.",
                "Ask yourself whether you experienced abandonment in childhood. Much of the time, fear of abandonment has its roots in a childhood trauma. If you lost a parent or caretaker to death, divorce, or another cause, you might unconsciously fear the same scenario playing out again with other people.[11]",
                "Think about whether you have felt abandoned by a partner. Sometimes, trauma experienced in adulthood can also make you afraid of being abandoned. Ask yourself whether you have lost a partner or someone else close to you through death, divorce, or financial abandonment. These situations can create a general fear of abandonment in some people.[12]",
                "Evaluate your self-esteem. Many people who are afraid of others leaving them suffer from low self-esteem. If you frequently seek validation from other people or attempt to derive your self-worth from your relationships, you might be afraid that others will abandon you and cut off the source of your positive feelings about yourself.[13]",
                "Ask yourself whether you tend to feel anxious. People who are predisposed to anxiety are more likely to fear being abandoned. Many anxious people have vivid imaginations. If you have imagined what it would be like to be abandoned, you might become afraid of it happening, even if it has never actually happened to you before.[14]\n\nPeople with anxiety tend to expect the worst in a situation. For example, you might get anxious (e.g. your heartbeats fast and your palm sweats) when your partner does not immediately answer a phone call. You might worry that there has been an accident, or that the person is purposely avoiding you.\nIn order to overcome anxiety, you must learn to challenge how realistic your thoughts are. Do you have reason to suspect your partner has been in an accident? Is there evidence to show he or she is ignoring you?\nTo combat anxiety most effectively, it may be helpful to see a mental health therapist who has experience treating this condition.",
                "Seek professional help. Depending on the severity of your fear and how this is currently impacting your life, it may be beneficial to seek guidance and support from a qualified therapist or counselor. Look for someone who is certified in treating people with fear of abandonment, as they may be able to help you learn to separate fears of the past from what is actually happening in the present.[15]\nAs you learn to separate the past from the present, and recognize that your fears are not realistic expectations in your current life, you can begin to develop healthier coping skills to any emotional responses you may have in your daily life."

        "How to Plan a Bake Sale": {
            "intro": "Organizing a bake sale is an excellent way to raise money, especially for charity, or something new your community needs money for. Bake sales are easy to organize, easy on the pocket, and fun to do. With nothing more than small team of people, a dedication to a good cause, and some planning and baking, you can have a successful bake sale of your own.",
            "steps": [
                "Have a cause. Most bake sales are for raising money for a charity or cause. Be sure you and your customers understand who or what you are raising money for. Have posters or other advertising materials. It may help to make pamphlets or other media presentations available to explain your charity. This is a great opportunity to promote your cause, too.[1]\n\nPut out a jar for tips or donations. If you are raising money for a cause, give people the opportunity to donate without buying. Some people may not be hungry, or cannot buy sweets due to dietary restrictions, but they still might want to support your organization.\nMake sure you know how to send your profits to your charity.",
                "Make your team. Get your friends and family to help. If this is a fundraiser for a school, get the students involved. Let the kids have the option of participating in the fundraiser by baking goods with their parents to sell in the bake sale, and give them appropriate responsibilities.[2]\n\nMake clear what the cause is, when the bake sale is, and have reasonable shifts available.\nHow many volunteers you will need will depend on the size of your proposed bake sale. A small bake sale may be easily handled by one experienced volunteer. However, a large bake sale may need several people to coordinate helping customers, the cash box, setting up and taking down, and baking.\nYou might want to make one person in charge of organizing the volunteer bakers, one person in charge of renting the venue and the equipment needed, and one person in charge of publicizing the event.",
                "Decide on a venue. Generally, you want to be in a high traffic area. For instance, have your bake sale at a well-frequented public spot or in a school or college. If the bake sale is for your school, ask the Student Union, administration, or other appropriate staff for possible venues on the school grounds.[3]\n\nSometimes retail stores will be happy to have a booth set up nearby.\nCommunity events, such as festivals and special events like street fairs, outdoor public concerts, and other big public events are all excellent choices.\nAt schools, plays, concerts, open houses, sporting events, parent nights are excellent bake sale opportunities.\nMake sure that it is legal to hold at the spot you choose, and get permission from the appropriate authorities, if applicable.\nBe sure you have a \"rain site\" to do the bake sale indoors or under a tent in case the weather turns sour.",
                "Get all the equipment you need. You may be lucky and have a table and chairs available already and a sign made up already--especially if this is a yearly event. But if you do not, you will need to plan ahead. You may need:\n\n\nBooths or tables\nCard tables or folding tables\nSome sort of awning, like a pop-up pavilion or gazebo to protect from rain or sun\nTablecloths\nDecorations and signs to grab attention\nA cooler and ice to keep items like drinks cold\nA garbage container and garbage bags for cleanup\nFolding chairs\nCrock pots to keep liquid items warm\nA cash box. You need to keep your funds in some sort of container. Be sure it has change for large bills!",
                "Decide on the time. The best way to ensure a large number of potential customers at your bake sale is to have it coincide with another event. Or, if your bake sale is for your school, make sure you have it during a time when the greatest number of parents and kids can attend, such as a weekday evening. Some ideas for events to place your bake sale near include: elections, PTA events, school games, and community events.[4]\n\nYou will also want to make sure your date is in the sweet spot between being so soon that not enough people hear about and so far that people forget about it. Somewhere around two weeks from when you announce it should work.[5]",
                "Assign the baking work. Make sure you assign your volunteer bakers certain items to make through something like a sign up list, so you don't wind up with too many of some goods, and not enough of others.\n\n\nIf many people in an organization are baking, ask them to package things in sale-size quantities, perhaps two to three cookies to a package or one cupcake or larger item.",
                "Give instructions on how to pack the goods. Give the volunteer bakers a specific method for packaging their finished goods. It's a good idea to have every item individually wrapped in plastic wrap or a plastic bag, to avoid contamination that might cause allergic reactions.",
                "Give instructions on what to label on the packaging. All the goods should have the ingredients listed. Many people (especially children) have food allergies and sensitivities and dietary preferences. Providing a list of ingredients help people stay healthy and happy while supporting you. Knowing that a cookie has nuts in it or not may make a big difference.\n\n\nAn index card by the dish is an easy way to do this. You can also put sticky labels on plastic bags.\nMarking items with common allergens can be helpful (tree nuts, strawberries, peanuts, etc.).\nAlso mark foods which may be a good choice for certain people, such as gluten-free brownies, Kosher treats, vegan cookies, or nut-free items.",
                "Have a variety of types of baked goods. Try to include some healthy options too, instead of just cupcakes and pie. Not everything has to be sugary at a bake sale. Fresh homemade bread, pretzels, and corn muffins can sell too.[6]",
                "Set reasonable prices. Remember, it is a bake sale, so you don't have to get too caught up in the money as long as it is for a good cause. Optionally, you can even opt not to set any prices at all, except something like a $1 minimum, and let people pay what they want on the \"honor system\".[7][8]",
                "Coordinate the work. Decide who is going to do what once you start the event. Delegate people to retrieve and set up the equipment, someone to organize the goods and volunteers once they arrive, and someone to keep track of the money.[9] Invite your friends that will contribute and try hard. Make sure you have an adult around so if you need any help, they'll be there to help.",
                "Decide on an area you'd like to sell at. If you live in a suburb, consider moving the sale to the corner of your street, or to the front of the neighborhood. Move your set up to the reasonable area.",
                "Publicize the event. Design attention-grabbing and colorful media with the date, time, place and cause being supported. Design and share posters online or put paper ones up in well frequented areas.[10]\n\nIf you are selling at a school, have your bake sale announced over an intercom, in the daily notice or school paper, or whatever is available.\nAdvertise your organization through your clothes. If you are raising funds for your scout troop, for instance, wear your uniform.",
                "Make the goods. Bake sales are a good opportunity to bake a variety of goodies. A bake sale needs baked items, which ideally will be homemade. Have all your baking volunteers bake the goods the day before the sale, to ensure maximum freshness.[11]\n\nYou could bake the items yourself and this is usually the cheapest way. Divide the baking between many members, if possible.\nAlternatively, buy them from a local bakery or shop. This is particularly effective if people don't usually have access to such goods, such as at a high school. It also is easier for people who can't cook, or don't have the time.",
                "Get drinks to sell as well. A lot of people like to have a bit of liquid to wash down sugary treats, and it is an additional chance for you or your group to earn a bit of extra money.\n\n\nCoffee, tea, iced tea, lemonade, water, and soda are all good options. However, use common sense: hot coffee probably will not sell well on a hot summer day.",
                "Set up the event. Set up the tables, donation box, and signs. Keep track of all the volunteers arriving, and let them each know where they should set up their goods. Bring a supply of small paper plates, paper towels, plastic forks, napkins, cups if you are serving drinks that require them, and plastic wrap, bags, or foil. It's best to keep these to a minimum, as they cut into profits and create waste.[12]\n\nAll these tasks can be delegated to some of your team members. Don't try to stretch your own efforts too thin by putting yourself in charge of too many tasks.",
                "Get the party going. Double check that everyone is where they should be, and all the tables are full of delicious baked goods, and start selling. If you planned it well enough, this should be the easiest step of all. Consider getting some music going to make the atmosphere more fun and welcoming.[13]\n\nHave a cash box and start with a reasonable amount of change in it. Write down the amount so you can calculate how much you've earned at the end. Keep the cash box safe throughout the event.\nThank the customers for their support as they leave the event.",
                "Be polite when greeting the customer. \"Hey! How are you? Try some delicious treats for a low price!\" If the customer decides to buy a cupcake for example, consider packaging it in a cute cardboard box.",
                "End the event. Have a specific time when the event will end. Once it reaches that time, politely let everyone know that the bake sale is wrapping up. Let all the customers currently buying goods finish before you start packing up.\n\n\nOnce the event is over, count the money earned and thank all the volunteers for their help. Help them pack up their unsold goods.",
                "Leave the area clean. Be courteous and leave your area as clean or cleaner than you found it. Remove all the tables, chairs, and other equipment rented for the event. Clean up and throw away all the trash. Ask some of the volunteers to help you with this.[14]",
                "Send the leftovers somewhere. Let the volunteers know that they are of course free to take their leftover goods home with them, but also provide an option for them to donate their unsold baked goods. Contact a local food shelter or nursing home and ask them if they would like to take your unsold goods. Then ask one of the volunteers to deliver the goods, or do it yourself, as soon as possible, so they're still fresh.[15]"

            "intro": "Abortion is a common medical procedure that people may undergo at some point in their lives. To some the subject is extremely taboo, surrounded with religious shame, political oppression, and other social pressures. This unfortunate situation leaves people feeling alone and afraid when considering, during, and after the process of having an abortion - just when they need support the most.Here is how to support yourself or a loved one when healing from an abortion, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.",
            "steps": [
                "Know that you are not alone. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 2003 (via Exhale), 1/3 of American women will have an abortion by the age of 45, and around the globe, the lifetime average is about one abortion per woman.",
                "Recognize that abortion means different things to different people. Some people feel a range of strong emotions afterwards. Others don't feel much, or are simply relieved. Allow yourself time to process any emotions, and don't feel like something is \"wrong\" with you if there isn't much to process.\n\n\nConsider how much of this article might apply to you. Many of these tips are for people who have a harder time. If you are having an easier time, there's nothing wrong with you, and this is okay.\nIf you're really struggling, it may help to take a week off from work or school to focus on your own health.",
                "Consider confiding in someone you can trust. Who do you know who is compassionate and would listen without judgment? Think about which of your friends, family members, mentors, and other allies you feel safest around. They should be good listeners, able to reflect compassion, and pro-choice. Perhaps you know others who have had abortions, or who have supported loved ones who have. If you don't feel you can trust anyone in your close circle with this matter, there are other resources out there, such as Exhale, an after-abortion counseling talk line.",
                "Treat yourself to funny movies, books, and other forms of entertainment while you are resting if you like these sorts of things. Give yourself time just to laugh and feel at ease. It occur to find things amusing and behave \"normally\". Any reasonable person knows you didn't come to your decision lightly, but you can recover as quickly as you like. You're not abnormal if you don't feel guilty or traumatised. Its okay to be okay with it all.",
                "Give yourself time to work through any difficult emotions. You don't want to become so busy that you fail to fully process, and thereby heal from, the experience. Take time just to be with yourself, a significant other, friend, or supportive mentor.",
                "Process the difficult emotions, if you have them. It is absolutely okay to feel grief. Don’t judge your feelings. Let them move through you.",
                "Do art. Try journaling, drawing, painting, collaging, songwriting, or any other form of creative expression that calls to you.",
                "Talk. You can even try talking into a recorder (a tape recorder, computer program... there are even iPhone apps for this nowadays) if you just need to get something off your chest.",
                "Reach out. Ask for what you need from your partner or support person.\n\n\nAfter an abortion, some people experience a hormonal crash similar to post-partum depression. If this happens to you, spend lots of time with your loved ones, snuggle, and talk to a doctor if you're worried.\nTalk to your partner. If you need them to just listen and validate your feelings, ask. It may help to ask about their feelings about this. Your partner, too, may be feeling a range of emotions (from strong emotions to nothing in particular) and may or may not need to process them.\nMention ways people can support you. If they feel worried about you, they'll feel better if they can help you. Do you want a heating pad, a back rub, just someone to spend time with you? Ask. Both of you might feel better for it.\nIf your partner is unwilling to support you, or makes you feel worse, remember that your needs come first right now. If he is being inconsiderate, insulting or guilt-tripping you, or simply unable to provide any support at all, it is best for you to take some space from him right now, and seek the support of friends who can truly be there for you. If he was not supportive of your decision or your healing, you have good reason to re-evaluate the relationship, but wait until the dust has settled and you’ve healed this issue before taking on a potentially stressful relationship reassessment. Also, learn to Recognize-a-Potentially-Abusive-Relationship.",
                "Meditate or pray. Work through your feelings.\n\n\nIf you are struggling with self-blame, learn to forgive yourself. Tell yourself \"I did the best I could at the time.\" If you feel like you did a bad thing by getting an abortion, write a list of some good things you could do: volunteering, helping out your family members, editing wiki articles on a subject you're familiar with, et cetera.",
                "Seek guidance. If you feel so moved, seek the guidance of mentors, counselors, or spiritual advisers you feel comfortable with within your own spiritual or religious tradition, or who are nonsectarian. Be careful to choose individuals who can treat you with compassion, not judgment. And remember that ultimately, you are your own best guide.",
                "Get the lessons. Be open to receiving the message of the experience as a whole. What might this experience of being temporarily, unexpectedly pregnant have come here to show you? What life lessons did it bring up for you, or in your relationship? What parts of yourself do you know better now? What do you feel inspired to do with your life now that you did not before?\n\n\nIf you feel so moved, try communicating with the spirit of the aborted fetus - through prayer, spoken word, a written letter, art, music, or whatever medium comes naturally to you. You can tell it whatever you want to. Perhaps you are remorseful and want to apologize to it, to express your sorrow. Perhaps you want to wish that spirit a better home, a more ready parent. Perhaps you wish to tell it that you would love to be its parent when you are ready, but that’s just not now. Communicate whatever you need.",
                "Communicate your feelings. You may wish to think about your reasons for not choosing parenthood at this time. What goals do you have that you wouldn’t be able to complete if you were to have to raise a child right now? Consider which of these goals are most meaningful to you. These are good questions to ask at any time. Welcome them, and be patient with the answers. Take time every day to meditate, pray, sing, journal, read self-help books, seek counsel, or do whatever it is that helps you discover your inner truth.\n\n\nWhat do you feel is your purpose in life? How can you contribute to society? Work on these goals.",
                "Avoid moderate to intense exercise for a week following abortion. Going for a walk, doing gentle yoga or pilates may help as soon as you feel you have the energy for it. Avoid doing inversions in yoga or anything that feels like a strain.",
                "Do not have sex or insert anything into the vagina for at least a week, or as long as your health care provider tells you to.",
                "If you are experiencing nausea, your health care provider may prescribe anti-nausea medication. You may find that salty crackers, dry toast, ginger ale or ginger tea can soothe the nausea. Eat small, frequent, fresh meals, and avoid excessively fatty or sugary foods.",
                "If you are losing lots of blood or are anemic, you’ll need to build up your blood. Take iron supplements with meals and especially with something vitamin-C rich, such as orange juice or tomatoes. Vegetarians can eat iron-rich, blood-nourishing and fortifying foods, which include dried apricots and figs, dark leafy greens, beans (especially black beans), lentils, berries, beets, carob, eggs, goji berries, and any whole foods that you crave. Now is not a time for junk food or skimping on meals. You need your strength. See How to Follow Dietary Requirements for an Anemic",
                "Rest as much as you can. Allow yourself to sleep 12 hours a night if that is what your body is asking for. You’re not lazy - you’re healing.",

It’s important to find the method of note taking that best compliments your study habits and the way you think. Perfect math note taking may be different for you than for others, but some elements are fairly universal.

In order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. Disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. Make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material.[2]\n\nIf there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. Your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class.\nThings teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking.\nMake sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important.",

Taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. You should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. You may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information.[3]\n\nStudies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. Retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks.\nReviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material.",
                "Use a laptop to take notes. Some people may prefer to use their laptop for note taking rather than writing by hand. If you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. Some teachers and professors don’t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start.[4]\n\nLaptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases.\nMake sure you don’t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture.\nYou may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster.",
                "Use an audio recorder in class. It can sometimes be hard to keep up when taking notes in class. Using an audio recorder during class can allow you to revisit portions of the lecture that you may have missed, or listen to the entire class again while you’re studying to help clarify topics or refresh them in your mind.[5]\n\nIf your teacher or professor does not address the use of recording devices ahead of time, you may want to ask them before recording them.\nDigital recorders often allow you to transfer recordings to a computer to better control which portions you want to listen to.",
                "Skip words, not numbers. When taking notes, it’s perfectly normal to skip unnecessary words, use abbreviations or even come up with your own shorthand. However, don’t allow yourself to skip steps when writing out how to complete math problems, or copying them from the board.[6]\n\nAlthough you may know how to complete a problem in class, you might have trouble remembering how to in the future.\nWriting out all of your work will help you to recall each step in the future.",
                "Use color for emphasis. There are a number of ways you can incorporate different colors into your note taking methods to emphasize the importance of sections or to help you organize your notes. Use different colors to write titles, draw lines between sections, or to help you pick out important elements.[7]\n\nUse a highlighter to highlight important things as you take notes or after class when reviewing them.\nTry different colored pens for titles or to add emphasis to sections.\nUse markers or colored pencils to make colorful divisions between topics or sections.",
                "Use a form of shorthand. Sometimes the concepts you need to take notes on in math class involve more than just numbers and equations. When your teacher or professor is going over concepts that require you to take notes that aren’t math problems themselves, use a form of shorthand to limit how much you have to write.[8]\n\nTry leaving out unimportant words. An example could be, instead of writing “Pythagoras made influential contributions to mathematics,” try simply writing, “Pythagoras was influential.”\nUse abbreviations and punctuation to reduce your writing. Your notes only need to make sense to you, so feel free to use + (plus) signs instead of the word “and,” km instead of kilometers, or any other abbreviations you can easily understand.",
                "Divide your pages into three equal columns. Unlike the Cornell Method of note taking, the three column method is designed specifically for use in math classes. You will use each column for different kinds of content in order to better organize your notes.[9]\n\nDraw two lines from the top of the lined section of the page to the bottom with a ruler, diving the page into three sections.\nYou may want to use a marker or different colored ink when drawing your dividing lines in order to help them stand out.",
                "Title each page clearly. You will need to write information at the top of each page to make it easier to locate the sections you are looking for and organize the material. Use the area at the top of the page to write the following information for future reference:[10]\n\nCourse Title\nTopic\nPage number (if there is a coinciding page in your text book)",
                "Use the left column for key words and topics. The left hand column of your notes should be reserved only for main points that you can associate with content in the following two columns. Keep the notes you take in the left hand column brief. Think of it as subject headers.[11]\n\nNotes in the left hand column should be short and provide a title of sorts for information you’ll be writing in other columns.\nYou may want to record formulas in the left column that coincide with ones you use when writing problems in the middle column.",
                "Copy math problems in the middle column. Use the middle portion of the page only to copy or work on math problems. When copying math problems off of the board, make sure to write down each step your teacher uses, so you can go back and model your work after it in the future. When doing the problems yourself, ensure you don’t omit steps you complete in your head, so you can refer to it again if you forget how in the future.[12]\n\nMark math problems you are unsure of with a question mark, then ask your teacher or a friend with help with them during or after class.\nMake sure to align your work with the appropriate title or main points in the left hand column.",
                "Take notes in the right column. The remaining column will be used to take down notes that explain steps, or help you to better understand the topics and problems covered in the other two columns. Use your own words to describe what you did to complete a problem.[13]\n\nThe right hand column can be used to write down anything you feel you need to remember.\nTry to keep the information in each column aligned with the corresponding material in the other columns.",
                "Divide your pages into three sections. The Cornell Method of note taking involves organizing information into three sections. Dividing your note sheets makes it easier to write down and to retain information for when you take a test. You may want to use a marker to draw the lines that divide your page to make them easier to see while note taking.[14]\n\nDraw one horizontal line across your page five lines from the bottom.\nDraw one horizontal line across the top line of the page.\nDraw a vertical line connecting the two about two inches from the left margin.",
                "Label the top with the course name, date and topic. When reviewing your notes, it will be easier to identify the sections you want to focus on if you write large, bold titles at the top of each page. The title section should be written across the top line you drew, and include the name of the class you’re taking notes in, the date, and the topic you are covering in class that day. Some examples of a title section would read:[15]\n\nAlgebra 1 – 6/4/2016 - Two-variable Linear Equations\nGeometry – 8/1/2015 – Transversals\nCalculus – 10/10/2014 – Chain Rule",
                "Take notes in the large box on the right. During the class, take short hand notes by copying main points your teacher writes on the board or writing important things your teacher says. Try to use abbreviations where possible to reduce how much you have to write, and leave a blank space between each new idea. This is also where you will copy down or work on math problems. Try to keep each topic and the math equations they involve together in your notes. Leave the other boxes blank during class.[16]\n\nKeep your notes brief and simple. Only write as much as you need to in order to remember the main points.\nAll of your note taking in class will be within that large box on the page.",
                "Review your notes after class to pull out the main points. After class, sit down and go over your notes again while the information is still fresh in your mind. As you read through them, identify the main ideas, points, dates or topics in your notes and list them in the left column you created with the vertical line.[17]\n\nTry to list the main points in the left column alongside where the notes relating to them are in the box on the right.\nIf you need to, draw lines connecting the main points to the notes relating to them.",
                "Summarize the main points of each page in the bottom box. Below the bottom horizontal line, summarize the material you took notes on above. Use your notes, as well as the main points you wrote on the left to help you.[18]\n\nWriting a summary of the information on each page will help you to recall the content in the future.\nYou can read the summaries to help you find specific topics in your notes, or as a study aid.",
                "Review your notes. When you complete the summary of your main points, look back over your notes and make sure you didn’t leave anything out. Your notes should have main topics, important terms, and formulas in the left hand box, your in-class notes in the right, and a summary of the material covered on the bottom of the page.[19]\n\nThe left hand box might say things like, “Linear Equations,” as well as an example such as “ax+b=0.”\nThe right hand box would contain all of the notes you took in class, including any equations you solved.\nThe summary box at the bottom may say something along the lines of, “ax+b=0 is considered the standard form, and not all equations will start as such. The variable could be X, but may be indicated as a different letter.”"

        "wikiHow to Safely Transport Your Guinea Pigs in the Car": {
            "intro": "There may be some times when you have to transport your guinea pig. This could be a quick trip to the vet or to a friends for a few days while you go away. However, cars can be dangerous places for a guinea pig (or any other small animal). In order to give your guinea pig a smooth and safe ride, you should prepare well for the trip and keep the guinea pig's safety and comfort in mind while you are actually traveling.",
            "steps": [
                "Buy a carrier. It should be made of cloth or plastic and not of metal or thick mesh. This carrier doesn't need to be made specifically for guinea pigs. Any small animal carrier that is big enough should work. Choose a carrier that is big enough for your pet to turn around, lie down, stand up, and a little extra room to move around in it.\n\n\nWhile the carrier shouldn't be made of metal or thick mesh, it can have a wire mesh door.",
                "Line the carrier with newspaper. Use a thickness of 20 sheets or more. Newspaper will not make a mess like bedding. You can cover it with fleece to make it more cozy.\n\n\nYou can also add shredded paper towels to the bottom of the cage, as the guinea pig may use them to create a safe place to hide.[1]\n\nJust as with your guinea pig's cage at home, your guinea pig's travel cage should not have a wire mesh bottom. This is hard on the pig's feet.[2]",
                "Put a handful of timothy hay in the carrier. Hay is an essential food for guinea pigs. They like to sleep in the hay and munch on it for comfort, and they should never be without it.\n\n\nGuinea pigs should have an unlimited supply of timothy hay at all times. This includes when they are traveling.[3]",
                "Put fruits and vegetables in your pet carrier. Soak the fruits and vegetables in water and then place them in a food bowl. This is important moisture for the guinea pig, as your pet will not have water on it's trip.\n\n\nDo not put a ceramic food dish in the carrier, as it might slide and harm your guinea pig.",
                "Put a water bottle in the carrier if you are taking a long trip. If you are going for a very long car trip, for instance more than a couple hours, your guinea pig will need access to water. In cases such as this, you will need to attach a water bottle to your guinea pig's carrier and clean up any spilled water on a regular basis.\n\n\nFor instance, clean up any water covered bedding every time you stop the car for a break.",
                "Prepare the temperature of the car. Make sure that the car is at an appropriate temperature before you bring you guinea pig in the car. In the winter, this may mean heating the car up for awhile. In the summer, this probably means cooling the car down before you put the guinea pig in it.\n\n\nGuinea pigs like to be at a temperature between 65 and 75 degrees. Try to get your car's temperature in this range before putting the guinea pig in it.[4]",
                "Place the guinea pig in the carrier. If your guinea pig is docile, you can simply pick it up and place it in the carrier. Usually, you put one hand under the guinea pig's belly and one under the guinea pig's hind legs.\n\n\nIf the guinea pig is skittish, you may need to have a stronger grip on the guinea pig. Corner it in its cage and get ahold of it as you would with a more docile guinea pig, but hold on a little tighter. Make sure the carrier is very close by, so you can quickly move the guinea pig straight into the carrier.\nOnce the guinea pig is inside of the carrier, close it properly. Make sure the carrier is secure and your guinea pig is as comfortable as possible.\nYou can put two guinea pigs in the same carrier. If you are travelling with more than one guinea pig, it is perfectly fine to put them both together in one carrier. However, you must keep checking on them both to see if they are getting along.",
                "Put the guinea pig cage in a secure location in the car. Good locations include in a foot well (it may be warmer here than the rest of the car) or on a seat with the seat belt fastened. Bad locations include places where the carrier will slide around and jolt when you stop, near the heating and air-conditioning (because it could be too hot or too cold), in the trunk, or on someone's lap (in the event of a crash, the carrier could harm the person holding it).\n\n\nAlso make sure that your guinea pig's cage will not be in the sun while you drive. This can quickly lead to the guinea pig getting overheated.\nYou should also avoid putting your guinea pig's cage next to your stereo speakers, if you are planning on playing your stereo. Guinea pigs are sensitive to sound, so they should not be exposed to loud sounds from your car stereo.[5]",
                "Drive your car responsibly. Begin to drive slowly and then pick up speed as if not to startle the guinea pig. Take turns slowly and try to make all driving adjustments, such as braking, gradually.\n\n\nThe goal should be to give the guinea pig a calm ride in the car. Abrupt movements and aggressive driving will move your guinea pig around in its cage involuntarily. This will most likely agitate the pig.",
                "Check on the guinea pig regularly. If you are taking a long drive, for instance if you are moving cross country, you need to check in on your pet regularly. Make sure it is doing ok and that its food and water are still secure.\n\n\nFor example, take a five minute break about halfway through your journey if you are travelling for over thirty minutes. Take this time to check their food and hay supply, as they need an unlimited supply of these.\nIf you are on a long drive and your guinea pig's food or water spills all over its cage, clean it up. You don't want your pet sitting in a dirty cage for hours while you drive.",
                "Look for signs of distress. Guinea pigs may naturally hide and be fearful during a car ride, so this is not necessarily a sign of true distress. However, there are some signs that the guinea pig is in real distress and needs attention. These can include repeated loud squeals, pacing, cowering in fear, and staying crouched over.[6]\n\nIf you have had your guinea pig for awhile, you should know if it is acting normally. However, remember that a guinea pig being transported is likely to exhibit some unusual behavior.\nTalk to the guinea pig during the ride. It may be comforting to the pig to know that you're there with it.\nNever leave your guinea pig in the car alone! It can get overheated very quickly in a closed up car.[7]"

            "intro": "Now how does one know which berries are edible? The best way is to learn about various species of harmful berries. Although eating a lethal berry just one time will not harm you, it will cause serious discomfort. While this list cannot cover every poisonous berry in North America, it will give you a solid set of guidelines from which to work.",
            "steps": [
                "When in any doubt, do not eat wild berries. At the end of the day, there are very few circumstances where the minuscule amount of calories in berries are worth the risk of getting sick. Even in a survival scenario, it is not worth the risk. Diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea all strip you of vital fluids and sugars, putting you in far more danger than you would have been without the small bit of food.\n\n\nJust because you see an animal eat a berry does not mean they are safe for humans.\nThe following advice is meant to give you guidelines, not hard rules. Never eat a berry you can't identify.",
                "Stay away from white, yellow, and green berries. In most cases (some botanists guess as high as 90%), these three colors indicate poisonous berries. While a knowledgeable camper might be able to name or find some exceptions, the best rule is to avoid all white, yellow, and green unless you're sure it is safe.[1]\n\nRed berries are roughly 50% safe to eat, so some basic testing may show you what is safe and what isn't. If they are in clusters -- usually bad. Solo berries -- usually okay.[2]\n\nIn general, blue, black, and aggregated berries (ie. raspberries, blackberries, etc.) are safe to eat. There are, however, some exceptions (Pokeberry, with its bright pink stalk and dark berries, is very toxic).[3]",
                "Stay away from berries on plants with spines, bitter smells, or milky sap. In general, the following plants are not safe for humans to eat, including the berries. You should check for:\n\n\nMilky or odd-colored saps.\nBerries or nuts in pods and bulbs\nBitter or soapy taste\nSpines or small pointy hairs\nPink, purple, or black spurs.\nThree-leaved growth pattern (like poison ivy)[4]",
                "Smash the berries to test the juice on your forearm, lips, and tongue. A good way to check berries in a pinch is to see if the juices cause any irritation. First, crush the berry on your arm, waiting five minutes or so to see if you get irritated. Then repeat the process on your lips and gums. Finally, chew a berry for 10-15 minutes, but don't swallow it. If none of this causes irritation, move on to the next step.\n\n\nOnly test one berry at a time. These tests are useless if you can't tell which of the two berries is causing the problem.[5]",
                "Eat 1-2 berries and wait 20 minutes if you absolutely must get something to eat. If you're in serious doubt, it is best to move on. But if you need the berries for survival, you should eat slowly, seeing how your body reacts. Within 20 minutes you should see symptoms if you're going to get sick.\n\n\nEven if you're fine after 20 minutes, keep eating slowly. Pace the berries out over a long time to prevent any toxins from gathering and give you time to adjust or note problems.\nIf the berry tastes terrible, then this is a good indicator that it may be poisonous.[6]",
                "Always look up or carry plant identification information when going to new environments. There are not a lot of hard and fast rules about berries because there is such a large variety. If you are going on a hike or an expedition, carry a book with the names, pictures, and descriptions of berries. This way you’ll know which berry you are looking at.",
                "Know the symptoms of berry poisoning. You will likely experience intense digestive disturbance and nervous symptoms. In general, if the following symptoms appear within a few hours of eating the berries, see a doctor immediately:\n\n\nNausea\nVomiting\nDizziness\nDiarrhea\nConvulsions\nBlurred vision\nCramps[7]",
                "Avoid any areas sprayed with herbicide, pesticides, or other chemicals. Otherwise fine berries can turn toxic in an instant if covered in chemicals. Smell the berries beforehand, and steer clear of areas near farms, homesteads, or large gardens to be safe.\n\n\nIf you know a berry is safe, but are worried about pesticides, you can still rinse the berries off in clean water and eat them safely.[8]\n\nChemical poisoning will often bring the same symptoms as poisonous berries.[9]",
                "Stay away from dark blue Virginia creepers. They have five-fingered leaves, grow tall, and are popular as a wall creeper. The berries are dark and blue. They are sometimes confused with the three-fingered poison ivy.[10]",
                "Note the dark purple, flat berries of the Pokeweed. The plant is also called poke, inkberry or garget. This is a tall and bushy plant. The flowers grow in long, bright pink clusters and the berries resemble dark blueberries. They look very, very appetizing. They are not.[11]",
                "Avoid the orange-yellow, encapsulated Bittersweet berries. This plant is easy to identify. Its berry is enclosed by an orange-yellow capsule. Make sure you do not eat them. Image of Bittersweets",
                "Steer clear of Deadly Nightshade, also known as belladonna, or jimsonweed. Many other plants in the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, such as potatoes, are not deadly. Deadly nightshade flowers are white or purple and are star shaped. They are mostly found in warm regions, such as in tropical America. They are mostly found as creepers. All parts, especially the unripened berry is poisonous. There are serious and often deadly symptoms after consumption.",
                "Never eat Ivy berries of any variety. They are green creepers, commonly climbing up trees or hanging low to the ground. They have dark green, waxy leaves. They also called English ivy, Japanese ivy, etc. They are native to Europe and temperate Asia. The berries are poisonous and are white when ripe.\n\n\nThe berries are usually very bitter, making you unlikely to like them anyway.[12]",
                "Stick away from Yew leaves and berries. The foliage is more toxic than the berries. Death is usually sudden without any symptoms. The berries are fleshy in appearance and bright scarlet. They have a cup-like depression at the base. The berry itself is not dangerous, but you should still avoid yew at all cost. The seeds can cause instant death.",
                "Kiss under Mistletoe but stay away from the berries. This plant grows and survives on other plants. This parasitic plant has yellowish flowers, small, yellow- green leaves, and waxy, white berries. It has not been established if these berries are harmful to humans or not at all points of the life cycle, but it is best to avoid them always to be safe.[13]",
                "Stay away from Holly. The Christmas bush has pointy, waxy leaves and bright-red berry clusters. One or two might not cause issues, but 15-20 can be fatal.[14]",
                "Don't eat Dogwood berries. Found in the eastern US in fall and winter, these dark red berries (with small, brown tips at the end), usually come in small clusters. The leaves are broad and rounded. While not deadly, you won't be having fun for the next few hours.[15]",
                "Stay away from Cotoneaster's big red berry bushels. This evergreen plant has long branches that often point up. They are often so heavy in bright-red, round berries that the branches are hidden. They resemble small, upside-down tomatoes, complete with little brown \"leaves\" at the end of the berry.[16]",
                "Pass on the yellow-orange American Bittersweet. Resembling little lemons mixed with grapes, the yellow berries come in big bunches. They have a little yellow tail at the end of them. American Bittersweet is common in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.[17]"

        "How to Irrigate Your Colostomy": {
            "intro": "Colostomy irrigation can be a way to avoid using a colostomy bag after a colorectal surgery, if you have a stoma. Irrigating involves instilling water through your stoma into your large intestine, to flush out your colon. This can be done every 1-3 days, minimizing odor and leaking and giving you more control over your bowel movements.[1] This process can increase your independence and quality of life, allowing for a more active and care-free life with a stoma. To manage the irrigation process you will first attach the irrigation sleeve, and then irrigate your colostomy with water.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn the irrigation process from your healthcare professional. If you are transitioning from a colostomy bag to using colostomy irrigation, learn the proper technique from your doctor, surgeon, or ostomy nurse. Though the procedure is relatively easy to learn, it’s always best to have a professional demonstrate it for you the first one or two times.\n\n\nAsk your care provider any questions you have about using your irrigation system. Don’t be afraid to ask for a repeat demonstration, such as, “Could you please show me how to do this again next week so that I know I’m doing it right?”\nIf at any point you experience difficulties irrigating at home, see your doctor or nurse for help.",
                "Get the supplies you need. At the least, you need to get an irrigation bag, tubing, a cone tip, an irrigation sleeve, an ostomy belt, and a clip.[2] Using some water-based lubrication on the end of the cone can make insertion easier, so try to obtain that, as well. Get materials by contacting suppliers directly or asking your doctor or ostomy nurse for recommendations. Call manufacturers or suppliers to request free sample if you want to test different products.\n\n\nThe ostomy belt and irrigation bag should last for several years. Replace the ostomy bag every 1-2 months or when it develops an odor.\nYou can continue to use the brand that you initially left the hospital with, or you can switch brands. It’s personal preference.[3]",
                "Create an irrigation schedule that works for you. Irrigation flushes your entire bowel, and the time it takes to refill depends on your body and your diet. Most people irrigate either daily or every 2-3 days. Irrigate your colostomy on a schedule once you establish your elimination pattern.[4]\n\nSpace out your irrigations as far apart as you’re comfortable, but if you experience leakage, try irrigating more frequently. For instance, if you irrigate every other day and experience leakage, try irrigating daily.\nIt takes about an hour to do a full irrigation. Set aside this time at the same time each day that you irrigate – this will help you remember to do it, and will help your body to learn its elimination timing.[5]\n\nOnce this pattern is established, you may not have to wear the colostomy pouch anymore. Instead, you will use a stoma plug or cap. Talk to your doctor about this.",
                "Prepare your supplies before you begin irrigating. When it’s time to irrigate, assemble all of your materials. Attach the cone tip to the end of the irrigation tube. Clamp the tube so water does not flow until you’re ready for it. Fill your irrigation bag with 500–1,500 milliliters (16.9–50.7  fl oz) (16-50 oz) of body-temperature water. Hang the irrigation bag at shoulder height or higher, preferably above your head.[6] Attach your adjustable ostomy belt to the irrigation sleeve, and put this belt around your waist.\n\n\nHang your irrigation bag however you can. Try using a clothes hanger hung on the corner of a bathroom mirror. Or, consider installing a more permanent fixture for everyday use.\nWhen you attach your belt to your body, your stoma should be in the center of the irrigation sleeve’s ring.\nMany ostomy nurses suggest using 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) (16 oz) of lukewarm water for the first several irrigations. You can use more or less depending on what your doctor or nurse recommend.",
                "Decide whether you want to sit or stand. Some people choose to stand beside the toilet, though this can be tiring. You could also sit up straight on the toilet itself, though some beginners may find this challenging. Consider sitting on a chair placed next to the toilet.[7]\n\nKeep the end of the sleeve clipped while you position yourself. If you’re standing, let the whole device rest on the floor. If you’re sitting, keep your appliances hanging.\nIf desired, put on rubber or latex gloves. This can help you stay clean while you get comfortable with your new equipment.",
                "Position your irrigation sleeve. Place the irrigation sleeve, which should already be attached to the adjustable belt, over your stoma. Position the other end of the irrigation sleeve so the irrigation water runs directly into the toilet.",
                "Eliminate any air bubbles that are in the tubing. Release the clamp to allow some of the water to flow into the irrigation sleeve. Re-clamp the tubing once all of the air bubbles have been removed.",
                "Insert the cone’s tip into your stoma. Moisten the pointed end of the cone with a water-based lubricant like K-Y Jelly or Lubrifax. Insert the cone’s tip so that it goes about three inches into your stoma, or about halfway in. Never force the pointy tip into your stoma.\n\n\nThe tip should fit snugly so that the amount of leakage is minimized during the irrigation process.\nYour stoma may react to being touched by clenching up. If this happens, sit calmly for a few moments, take some deep breaths, and try again.[8]",
                "Troubleshoot issues with cone insertion. Water may leak from the cone as you’re trying to insert it. If so, make sure the tip of the cone is pushed firmly into your stoma and is at least halfway in. Make sure you don’t have any blockages in the stoma by stopping and starting the water’s flow. Try removing the cone and letting the stoma empty, then inserting the cone again.[9]",
                "Allow water into the cone by releasing the clamp. Slowly release the clamp on the tube, allowing the water from the irrigation bag to gradually flow into the cone and enter into your stoma. If you start to feel an intestinal cramp, slow or stop the water for a minute and relax, then try again.[10]\n\nThis process should take about 5-10 minutes.",
                "Hold the cone in place for a moment before removing it. Once the irrigation bag has emptied, hold the cone in the same position for about 10 seconds. Carefully remove the cone after this time has passed.\n\n\nYou will start to expel water and waste shortly after you insert the water into your stoma. This may happen in stages or all at one time.",
                "Drain the output. Drain the waste output through the irrigation sleeve for about 10 minutes, allowing the contents to empty into the toilet. Keep the sleeve on for a full hour, especially at first when you’re learning how your body will respond to irrigation. You do not have to stay in the bathroom the whole time – feel free to clamp the tail of the sleeve closed and get up and move around. If you feel yourself starting to expel more waste, return to the bathroom and empty your sleeve into the toilet.[11]\n\nBe sure to clamp the sleeve before moving around to avoid spillage.",
                "Remove and wash the irrigation sleeve. After the full hour of drainage, remove your irrigation sleeve. Rinse the sleeve in cool water and hang it and the irrigation bag somewhere to dry. Some people recommend rinsing your sleeve with a vinegar solution about once a week to limit bacterial growth.[12]",
                "Replace your cap, patch, or mini-pouch to protect your stoma. Gently clean around your stoma using a washcloth, mild soap, and water. Do not rub the skin around your stoma – pat it dry with a paper towel, toilet paper, or tissue. Most people who irrigate only have to use a mini-pouch, patch, or cap over their stomas between irrigations. Be sure your appliance is clean, and replace it over your stoma until you need to irrigate next time.[13]"

        "How to Make a Water Filter": {
            "intro": "Water is essential to life. This technique is very useful when you are hunting for survival. People can live up to a week without food, but only two to three days without water. Clean water can be hard to find if you get stranded in the wild or if there is an emergency. If you have to find your own water supply, you must be able to strain out impurities that can make you sick. This article will tell you how to make a water filter.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather your supplies. You will be making a water filter that relies on layers to make dirty water clean. If you plan on drinking this water, you will need to boil it after you have filtered it.[1] Here is a list of what you will need:\n\n\nPlastic bottle with a cap\nCraft knife\nHammer and nail\nCoffee filter\nLarge cup or mug (Either one works)\nActivated charcoal\nSand\nGravel\nContainer to catch the water (jar, cup, mug, etc)",
                "Use a craft knife to cut the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) or so off of the plastic bottle. Stick the knife into the side of the bottle, and start cutting it slowly. You may find that making short, back-and-forth cuts (like sawing) may be easier.\n\nIf you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step\nAdd handle so that you can hang it while it filters the water. Start by poking two holes near the cut edge of the bottle. Make the holes opposite of each other. Thread a piece of string through the two holes. Tie the string in a knot.",
                "Use a hammer and nail to punch a hole in the cap. The hole will help slow down the flow of water and make the filter more effective. If you don't have a hammer or nail, use a craft knife to stab an X shape into the bottle cap.",
                "Put the coffee filter over the mouth of the bottle and tighten the cap over it. The coffee filter will keep the activated charcoal inside the bottle and keep it from falling out. The cap will hold the coffee filter in place.",
                "Put the bottle cap-side-down into a mug or cup. This will help keep the bottle steady while you fill it. If you don't have a cup or mug, then you can place the bottle down on a table. You will need to hold it steady with one hand.",
                "Fill the bottom third of the bottle with activated charcoal. If the charcoal comes in large pieces, you will need to break them down into smaller pieces. Do this by putting the chunks inside a bag, and crushing them with a hard object (such as a hammer). You don't want the chunks to be larger than a pea.\n\nCharcoal can get very dirty. You can keep your hands clean by wearing some gloves.",
                "Fill the middle of bottle with sand. You can use any type of sand you want, but avoid using colored craft sand. Colored sand may leak dyes into the water. Try to make the sand layer about as thick as the charcoal layer. The bottle should be a little more than half-way full by now.\n\nTry using two types of sand: a fine grained sand and a coarse grained sand. The finer sand will go first, on top of the charcoal. The coarse grained sand will go next, on top of the fine-grained sand.[2] This will create more layers for the water to pass through, and help make it cleaner.",
                "Fill the rest of the bottle with a gravel. Leave an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so of empty space between the gravel and the cut part of the bottle. Do not fill the bottle all the way with gravel, or the water may spill over if it does not drain fast enough.\n\nTry using two types of gravel: a fine grained gravel and a chunky gravel. The fine grained gravel will go first, on top of the sand. The chunky gravel will go next, on top of the fine gravel.[3]",
                "Choose a jar to catch the filtered water. Make sure that the jar is clean and large enough to hold the water you plan on filtering. If you don't have a jar, try using a bowl, cup, pot, or a mug.",
                "Hold the filter over the container. The cap should be pointing towards the bottom of the container. If your jar has a large opening, try setting the water filter down on top of it. This way, you won't need to hold the filter. If you made a handle for your filter, hang the filter up now. Place the jar right under it.",
                "Pour water into the filter. Make sure that you pour slowly. This way, the water will not overflow. If the water starts to reach the top of the filter, stop and wait for the water level to go down. Once you can see the gravel again, pour some more water.",
                "Wait for the water to flow into the jar. This will take about seven to ten minutes. As the water passes through the different layers, it will become cleaner.",
                "Pour the water back through the filter if it is not clear.[4] Once the water stops dripping, take the jar out from under the filter. Slide a new jar under the filter, then pour the filtered water back over the gravel. You may need to repeat the filtering process two or three times before the water runs clear.",
                "Boil the water for at least one minute to make it safe to drink. The water will also still contain dangerous bacteria, chemicals, and microorganisms. You can get rid of all these by boiling the water for at least one minute.[5]\n\nIf you are higher than 5,000 feet (1,000 meters) above sea-level, you will need to boil the water for at least three minutes.[6]",

                "Make cloudy water clear again by pouring it through a coffee filter. Get a round, cup-shaped coffee filter and turn it upside down so that it fits over a cup like a lid. Wrap a rubber band around the coffee filter to keep it in place. Slowly pour the cloudy water over the coffee filter. Boil the water afterwards to make it drinkable.\n\nIf you don't have a coffee filter, use a paper towel or a piece of cotton fabric instead. Make sure that the square is big enough to fit over the mouth of the cup. Try to use white fabric or a blank paper towel. Colored fabrics and paper towels contain dyes, which may bleed into the water.",
                "Make a water filter using a banana peel. Fruit peels have the ability to absorb bacteria. Peel a banana, and grind the peel in a blender. You may discard the banana or eat it; you won't need it for the filter. Once the peel is blended, put it into a coffee filter. Hold the filter over a cup. Pour water through the coffee filter. The banana peels will help absorb bacteria, and the coffee filter will help make the water clear again.[7]",
                "Make a plant xylem filter using a water bottle and a pine branch. Sapwood, such as pine, contains xylem, which can absorb and filter out dirt and bacteria. It can remove up to 99.9% of bacteria from water, but will not remove viruses such as hepatitis and rotavirus.[8][9] You will need to boil the water after filtering it to make it safe to drink. Here's how to make a xylem filter:[10]\n\nCut a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) long piece from a pine tree branch.\nPeel off the bark, and make sure that it can fit into the neck of the bottle. If it is too wide, shave it down using sandpaper or a pocket knife.\nSlide the first inch (2.54 centimeters) or so of the stick into the neck of the bottle.\nCut the bottom of the bottle off and turn the bottle upside down.\nFill the bottle with water, and let the water drain through the stick.\nDo not let the stick dry out. If it dries out, it won't be as effective.[11]"

        "wikiHow to Choose an Air Purifier for Allergies": {
            "intro": "Air purification is a top priority for many because air quality can have a significant effect on a person’s health and well-being. Since the 1940’s air purifiers have been used to clear indoor environments of air pollutants such as dust, pollen, mold and more. With so many purifiers on the market, it is important to know how to search for one that will decrease allergen causing pollutants, and help both you and your family to breathe easier.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a room air purifier. This is your only option for an air purifier if your home doesn’t have forced-air heating or cooling. These range in weight from 10-20 pounds, have a handle for moving, and stand on the floor or table in the room of choice. They generally cost less than whole-house models, ranging anywhere from $60 to a couple hundred dollars.[2]\n\nRoom air purifiers require annual replacement of the filter that captures airborne particles responsible for allergies. Over time, this expense can approach the cost of the air cleaner itself.\nSome newer models have cleanable and reusable HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters.\nAir purifiers and filters can be purchased at your local department store or hardware store.",
                "Opt for a flat, whole-house air filter. This is an inexpensive option which works with your house’s built-in heating and cooling unit. You simply replace your furnace’s filter with your filter of choice.[3] Filters come in four different varieties: flat filters, extended media filters, electronic filters, or ultraviolet filters. Replacement is required every 1-3 months. These are considered the most efficient way to filter household air because as long as the fan is running, the system is continuously filtering the air in your home.[4]\n\nYour house’s current heating and cooling system contains a flat filter that is used to protect your furnace from large particles of dust. Replace it with a pleated filter that attracts allergens like pollen and pet dander. They cost about $15 and should be replaced every 2-3 months.[5]",
                "Try an extended media filter. An extended media filter is a whole-house filter piled in the shape of an accordion. Its shape makes it more effective than fiberglass filters. The filter is built into your home’s ductwork, and requires professional installation. Media filters range in price from $400-$600, and the filters, which should be replaced annually, cost $40-$60.[6]\n\nThe pile of filters makes it more effective than flat fiberglass filters in catching allergens and air pollutants.",
                "Consider electrostatic precipitators. Also known as electronic filters, these filters put a high voltage charge on particles to attract them like a magnet. Electrostatic precipitators are built into the ductwork of your home and cost anywhere from $600 to $1000 installed. Electronic filters will never need to be replaced but wash the collector plates require in soapy water every few months.[7]\n\nIonization, or the process of charging particles, has been known to create trace amounts of ozone and cause lung irritation.\nThe electric charge is also responsible for attracting allergens like pollen and pet dander.",
                "Avoid a dedicated ozone generator. Ozone generators are a type of room purifier which emit small amounts of ozone by design. Manufacturers suggest that the byproduct reduces allergens such as dust, smoke, pollen and mold.[8] However, studies have shown that these claims are inaccurate, that packaging by manufacturers is misleading, and that the emission of ozone can cause health hazards.[9]\n\nThe state of California has banned the sale of ozone generators due to health concerns.\nOzone generators are typically purchased for places where ozone is needed, such as places where there is gaseous pollution. They should not be used to remove allergens such as dust, mold spores, pollen, or bacteria.[10]",
                "Consider the size of the purifier. When choosing an air purifier you have to consider the size of your household or office. Air purifiers range in size from some that are compact and portable to some that take up a lot of space. Always get one that is made to operate in a space that is slightly larger than yours actually is. This will help to guarantee that the machine will be capable of removing allergens and emitting fresh and clean air.[11]",
                "Opt for a HEPA filter. HEPA filters (high-efficiency particulate air) are the most effective at capturing air pollutants such as dust, pollen, mold spores, and pet dander. The HEPA filter guarantees that 99% of these contaminants are completely filtered. It is the model most recommended by doctors.[12]\n\nThe HEPA filter can be vacuumed meaning that it only has to be replaced every 5 years as opposed to every few months with other filters.\nIt is important for those with allergies to avoid purchasing just any air purifier or vacuum cleaner. Ensure that you are purchasing a “true HEPA” by checking the particulate size noted by the manufacturer on the box.[13]",
                "Make sure it has a servicing indicator. The indicator is a light that lets you know when it is time to clean or replace your filter. Whether it’s a room purifier or a whole-house model, ensure that your purifier has a service indicator to make sure the air cleaner works effectively.[14]",
                "Search for a low-noise system. Air purifiers can be noisy, particularly when they operate on the highest setting (the setting on which most manufacturers test their devices). Look for a system with quiet operation functions or choose a model designed for a larger area so it will clean better even at lower, quieter speeds.[15]",
                "Look for easy-change filters. Search for an air purifier that requires no tools to remove the filter for cleaning or replacement. Look for a system that contains a pop-out door that allows the filter to be easily pulled out for replacement. The average person may put off changing a filter due to the difficulty or tediousness of the task.[16]",
                "Look for the airflow rating or air change rate. Manufacturers list the airflow rating in CFM or cubic feet per minute. The airflow rating is a measurement of the air change per hour (ACH) or how many times the unit purifies the room during one hour. Look for a purifier that has 4-6 air exchanges per hour, or once every 10-15 minutes.[17]\n\nThe manufacturer’s ACH rate is usually calculated at the maximum operating speed for the maximum room size. Running on maximum speed usually means a noisier air purifier. If you prefer to run your machine at a lower speed, oversize your purchase by 20-40%.[18]",
                "Look for an efficiency rating certified by the AHAM. The clean-air delivery rate (CADR) measures the volume of air filtered and delivered by an air cleaning system.[19] In short, it measures how quickly it can remove airborne pollutants. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers certifies the CADR of air purifier systems. A system with a CADR above 350 is excellent while anything below 100 is poor.[20]\n\nThe CADR measures how quickly the system can remove smoke, dust, and pollen. Smoke ranges from 10-450, dust from 10-400, and pollen from 25-450. The higher the number, the faster the machine.[21]",
                "Search for an “Asthma and Allergy Friendly” certification. The “Asthma and Allergy Friendly” endorsement is a fairly new certification from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation. This certification signifies that the air purification system won’t just redistribute pollutants, but will actually reduce them.[22]\n\nIn order to meet specifications of the program, the air cleaner must reduce bio-allergen levels as a result of removal (and not just re-distribution, and must not contribute to ozone levels.[23]\n\nThis Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification was started in 2006 and the program independently tests consumer products.[24]\n\nA list of certified devices can be found on the Asthma and Allergy Friendly Program’s website.[25]",
                "Read consumer reviews. Online consumer reviews are often helpful in determining whether products are as effective as they claim to be. Reading consumer reviews can address certain features that may not be discussed by the manufacturer such as lifespan, ease of changing the filter, effectiveness towards specific allergies, and more. There are many website, such as Consumer Reviews, that provide reviews and buying guides for consumers.[26]"

You can think of this as the position your wrist takes when you say \"stop\" with your hand. Whether you're typing, eating, or doing some other repetitive movement, you should try to maintain a neutral wrist position as often as you can instead of flexing your wrist. Think of the neutral position as the handshake position -- when you shake someone's hand, you don't have to bend your wrists at all. Carefully monitor your hands to try to maintain this position as much as possible.[1]",

Though the best thing you can do to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome is to take care of your wrists, studies show that maintaining your overall health can help you have healthy wrists. Make sure to eat at least three healthy meals a day, get regular exercise (around 30 minutes a day), to get 7-8 hours of sleep a night, and to do whatever else you have to do to feel both mentally and physically sound.",
                "Consider wearing a wrist splint if you need one. Wrist splints, when worn correctly, can help you maintain a neutral wrist position without causing any discomfort. You can get a relatively inexpensive wrist splint at the local pharmacy (they typically cost around $15-20), or if you want more help, your doctor or physical therapist can recommend or even order more advanced splints. You can wear these while you work to keep you from bending your wrists, and you can also wear them at night to maintain a neutral position while you sleep; a lot of people sleep with bent wrists.",
                "Take NSAIDs if necessary. NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Advil, and they can be used to reduce pain and swelling in your wrists. Though they won't prevent carpal tunnel, they can certainly ease the pain if they are taken from time to time. Don't make a habit of this, though, because these drugs should not be a substitute for other preventative measures.[4]",
                "Keep your hands warm. If you're working in a cold environment, you are more likely to develop pain and stiffness in your hands. Try to maintain a warm temperature where you work, to wear gloves when it's cold outdoors, and to even consider wearing fingerless gloves if you cannot control the temperature indoors.[5]",
                "Keep your forearms level with the keyboard. Adjust your chair so that your forearms are level with your keyboard. You shouldn't have to hunch down or reach up to use your keyboard. This position is optimal for keeping your wrists in a neutral position.",
                "Maintain proper posture. Sit up nice and tall instead of slouching. This will keep your body from feeling too much strain in any one area, including your wrists. Also, keep your work right out in front of you so you don't have to bend or twist to one side or another to reach it.[6]",
                "Keep your hands and wrists in line with your forearms. This will also keep you from straining your wrists too much. If your forearms are level with your keyboard, then this should not be difficult.",
                "Use tools that are the proper size for your hands. Using a mouse that is too large or too small can make you strain your wrists and use more force than necessary.",
                "Consider using a vertical mouse. A vertical mouse will keep your hand in the handshake position. If you use one of these, you'll never have to flex your wrist when clicking. It does take a little while to get used to the mouse, but once you do, you'll be glad you got one. Though they can be a little pricey ($70 or more, in some cases), they will be well worth it.",
                "Consider getting a split keyboard. The split keyboard is a keyboard that splits down the middle, allowing you to type with both hands in the handshake position. You can adjust the keyboard to split a little bit at first, moving it to split more drastically as you get used to it. You can plug it into your keyboard and rest it right over your original board. This will have a dramatic effect for preventing carpal tunnel syndrome. These keyboards range from $30 to hundreds of dollars, and it's up to you to decide what kind works best for you. Don't splurge on an expensive split keyboard if you've never used one, though, or you may find that it's not for you.[7]",
                "Ice your wrists. Some doctors recommend that you ice your wrists several times a day, when you're feeling pain in that area.[8]",
                "Try \"hot and cold\" therapy. For this form of therapy, you'll need to set up two large bowls of water -- one should be ice cold, and one should be hot (just not so hot that it burns you). Set them up in your sink and place your hands and wrists into the cold bowl for one minute, and then move them into the hot bowl for one minute. Repeat this exercise for ten minutes twice daily to relieve the pain in your wrists.",
                "Use a mini foam roller. Use a mini foam roller that is about as wide as a quarter to roll your wrists up and down on it for twenty seconds on each wrist. Just place the roller on your table and gently roll your wrist up and down the roller, giving your wrists a nice, relaxing massage.[9]",
                "Get a forearm massage. Either use your other hand or get a trusted massage expert to gently massage your forearms, wrists, and palms to relieve the tension in your hands. Make sure that the massage is gentle and does not cause more pain in the areas that need to be worked out.[10]",
                "Use a regular foam roller. Lie down on the roller, so that your back is lined up with the roller, and move your arms out to your sides (think of the \"shavasana\" pose in yoga). This will open up your back, reducing the strain you've been placing on your back and your arms. Hold this pose for up to a minute. You can also alternate your arms, moving one up above your head, and the other down by your sides, repeating this for a minute. This will shake out and reduce some of the tension in your arms, wrists, and back.",
                "Try some wrist exercises. There are many wrist exercises that you can try to both strengthen your hands and wrists and to relieve the tension in your hands and arms. If you make an effort to do these when you take breaks, or just a few times a day, you'll feel your wrists getting stronger. These exercises will both stretch your wrists and build strength where you need it. Here are some exercises you can try:\n\n\n\"Pushing the wall.\" Place your hands straight out in front of you, flexing your wrists, so that you're facing the backs of your hands, as if you were going to push the wall away from you. Hold this position for five seconds, relax your wrists, and repeat at least ten times.[11]\n\nMake fists. Simply place your hands into loose fists for at least five seconds, and then let go of the fist for 1-2 seconds. Repeat at least ten times.[12]\n\nMake fists and bend your wrists down. Place your arms straight out in front of you, in fists. Now, bend your wrists down slightly and hold this position for five seconds, feeling a deep stretch. Repeat ten times.[13]\n\nStretch your wrists. Place one wrist out in front of you, in the \"stop\" position, and gently bend back your fingers, holding for five seconds. Then, move your fingers down, toward the floor, and bend your wrist downward, in the opposite direction, for another five seconds. Repeat ten times on each hand.\nShake out your wrists. Gently shake out your wrists, as if you washed your hands and were drying water off of them. Do this for about ten seconds at a time. This is a perfect activity to try during breaks, to get some of the stiffness out of your wrists. You can also try gently rolling them as well.",
                "Go to a doctor if you are experiencing pain in your wrists. If you start to feel pain, numbness, tingling, or discomfort in your wrists, then you should see a doctor to discuss next steps. One sign that you may be on your way to carpal tunnel is extreme pain when putting your thumbs into fists, and almost no pain in the pinkie finger, which is controlled by a different nerve than the rest of the fingers. A doctor can recommend further tests and treatment, and may even refer you to a physical therapist.\n\n\nPhysical therapy can help you learn exercises to prevent further pain, order the proper ergonomic equipment, and change your lifestyle. You may also get a soothing forearm massage, or even ultrasound treatment to help the circulation in your wrists."

            "intro": "Cheesecake has long been considered one of the most decadent desserts by food lovers everywhere. While the prep and cooking time is generally three hours, this creamy, dreamy dessert is truly worth it. Scroll down to Step 1 to start making delicious baked cheesecake.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose your pan wisely. Cheesecakes are notoriously crumbly, so choosing the right pan will ensure that your cheesecake comes out smoothly when you take it out of the pan. For the best outcome, use a springform pan. This sort of pan is comprised of round cake pan with a removable bottom. It is all held together by a sprung collar.[1]",
                "Cover the pan with aluminum foil. For the best cheesecake you’ve ever eaten, you’ll need to bake it surrounded by boiling water (this will be discussed in Part Three). To avoid any water leaking into your pan and ruining your crust, you will need to wrap the pan with hole-free aluminum foil. Place a piece of foil under the pan and then wrap it upwards and fold it so that the foil rests along the edge of the pan but doesn’t fold over the lip.[2]\n\nIf needed, use a second piece of foil to cover any spots that the first piece missed.",
                "Place a rack in the lower third of the oven. Once you have done this, preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C)(176c). While the oven is preheating, place the graham crackers into a blender or food processor. Make sure that the lid is tightly secured and pulse the crackers until they reach a finely ground texture.",
                "Pour the graham cracker dust into a large bowl. Use a spatula to stir in the salt and sugar, making sure that all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove and then add it to the mixture. Wash your hands and use them to mix the ingredients together using a folding movement until all the ingredients are well mixed.[3]\n\nIf you chose to use salted butter, you should not have to add the pinch of salt called for in this step.",
                "Pour the crust mixture into the pan. Save about ¼ cup of the mixture to use later if need be (you can use it if you discover any holes in your crust once you remove it from the pan). Press the crust down with your hands, making sure that there are no holes. The result should be an even layer of crust that ever so slightly curves up along the edges of the pan.\n\n\nWhile pressing the crust into the pan, make sure that you do not accidentally tear any of the foil. If you do notice a tear, replace it with a different piece of tin foil.",
                "Place the pan in the oven. The crust will need to harden up a bit--putting it in the oven for 10 minutes should achieve the desired texture. Once the 10 minutes have passed, remove the pan from the oven and turn the oven temperature down to 325°F (163C). Let the crust cool for several minutes.",
                "Cut your cream cheese into large chunks. One by one, cut away a chunk of the cream cheese and place it into the bowl of your electric mixture. Use the paddle attachment of your electric mixture to get the creamiest texture. Mix the cream cheese for four minutes on a medium speed--the result should be a smooth texture.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an electric mixture, place the cream cheese in a large bowl and use a handheld electric mixer to stir it up.",
                "Add the sugar to the cream cheese. Pour your sugar into the bowl and mix the two ingredients together for four minutes. Your mixture should be set to a medium speed. Repeat this process with the vanilla and salt. Add one ingredient and then mix for four minutes. Then add the other ingredient and mix for four minutes.[4]",
                "Crack the eggs into the bowl on at a time. When you add one egg, turn the mixer on and beat it for one minute. Repeat this process with the three remaining eggs. Use a spatula to scrape along the insides and bottom of the mixing bowl. This is important to do because large chunks of cream cheese can get stuck in these areas. Next, add the sour cream and mix thoroughly. Follow this up with the heavy cream, which you should also mix until the ingredients are all blended together.",
                "Pour the filling into the pan on top of the crust. Make sure that you scoop out all of the filling while also making sure that it doesn’t overflow the pan. Once it is in the pan, use a spatula to make the top smooth.[5]",
                "Place the springboard pan into a high-sided roasting pan. Bring two quarts of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, carefully pour it into the roasting pan so that the water reaches about halfway up the side of the springboard pan. While this might sound like an odd instruction, you are actually giving the cake a water bath that will help the filling to cook without cracking the crust.[6]",
                "Place the pan inside a pan on the lower rack of the oven. Set your timer for one and a half hours and let your delicious cheesecake bake. After the baking time has passed, open the oven and gently shake the cheesecake back and forth to ensure doneness. The cake should wiggle slightly in the center and should be firm around the edge. The center will firm up as the cake cools.",
                "Turn off the heat. Open the door of the oven so that it is about an inch open. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven as the oven cools, which should take about one hour. This sort of slow, gentle cooling will make sure that the crust doesn’t crack in the face of the cold air outside the oven.",
                "Cover the top of your cheesecake with foil and place it in the fridge. You will want to leave it in the fridge for a minimum of four hours. The cold temperature will help the cheesecake to firm up.\n\n\nSome dessert chefs believe the cheesecake should be cooled uncovered for two to three hours. Chilling the cheesecake this way also helps to disperse the moisture that would otherwise form on the top of the cheesecake.[7]",
                "Remove your cheesecake from the pan. Once it has chilled thoroughly, you can slide a spatula along the inside of the pan to separate the crust and cake from the pan. You must wait to do this until after the cheesecake has cooled or else you run the high risk of separating the cheesecake from its crust. Open the springform latch and gently remove the sides, leaving the cheesecake in all its glory.[8]",

        "How to Have Courage": {
            "intro": "What can you do to tackle your fears head-on?",
            "steps": [
                "Embrace your fear. Being courageous means doing something despite the fear. Fear comes from the body's natural response to the brain's fight or flight response. The brain sends cortisol, a stress inducing hormone, throughout the body's nervous system, making the body go into hyper-drive. Fearfulness is a learned behavior, based in our brain chemistry, but strengthened by the world around us that has trained us to be fearful. Learning to work through fear and step beyond it is about retraining your mind. [2]\n\nAvoiding fears actually makes them stronger and scarier. There's a certain mindset in Western culture that views emotions as weakness and seeks to suppress them. But suppressing negative emotions only heightens the fear of the negative emotion itself, strengthening them the more they are avoided.[3]\n\nExposing yourself to things that you fear (while being sure to stay safe and be smart about it) can help the brain become desensitized to the fear and make it easier for you to face.[4]",
                "Try not to hesitate. The longer your brain has to come up with excuses for not being courageous, the more time you will have to panic about hypothetical negative outcomes. If you are in a situation where you have to pick up a spider, jump out of an airplane, or ask someone on a date, do it without hesitation if you're going to do it at all.[5]\n\nReinforce your successes by giving yourself a reward when you do deal with your fear. This could be a physical treat, like a nice bottle of wine, or a mental treat, like taking a break from human interaction and binge-watching a show on Netflix.",
                "Learn to be mindful. Being mindful is when you are fully present in the current moment. Mindfulness can help change your brain to deal with fear in a more effective manner. You have to give yourself time to learn this skill and it takes practice.[6]\n\n\nMeditation is one way to help improve your mindfulness. Find a quiet place and sit comfortably. You can meditate on the bus, at an airport, or any busy place, but it is best to start by learning in a quiet place with few distractions. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing (thinking \"in\" when you breathe in and \"out\" when you breathe out can help with that focus.). Do this for twenty minutes. Be aware of the moment and of your sensations. If you do find yourself becoming distracted with other thoughts, direct your attention back to your breathing.\nWhen you do find yourself overwhelmed by fear, using the practices learned from meditation and mindfulness can help you overcome. Focus on your breathing and take deep breaths. Allow yourself to feel the negative emotions, but label them as emotions you are having (for example: if you are thinking, \"I am afraid,\" rephrase it as, \"I am having a thought that I am afraid.\"). It's a subtle distinction, but one that helps you not to be ruled by your thoughts.\nVisualizing your mind as the sky and your emotions, both positive and negative, as clouds passing across the surface of the sky can help you see them as being a part of you, but not dictating your life.",
                "Get outside your comfort zone. Stepping outside your comfort zone may cause anxiety, but it's a great way to learn courage.[7] Doing something you don't normally do helps you cope with the unexpected, which is where fear often springs from. Learning to deal with that fear, in a situation you have chosen, can help you perform courageously when the unexpected happens.\n\n\nStart small. Start with the actions that induce less fear and require less courage to accomplish. So, send a friend request on Facebook to that girl you like, or have a small conversation with the person behind the register before moving on to asking someone out.[8]\n\nKnow your limits. There are certain things that we just cannot do. Maybe you absolutely can't pick up that spider, come out to your homophobic boss, or go skydiving. That's okay. Sometimes these are fears or limitations that can be worked up to and sometimes they aren't. Sometimes it is highly adaptive not to be courageous; it may not make sense to do something you can't get yourself to do. Focus on building your courage for other things, like putting a glass over the spider so someone else can take care of it, or coming out to your parents instead of your homophobic boss.",
                "Build confidence. Having confidence allows you to trust in your abilities and yourself, and realize that you are more than your fears. When you have confidence in yourself you will find it easier to take courageous action. Learning to have confidence takes practice.[9] There are a number of ways to build confidence:\n\n\nFake it until you make it. You can trick your mind into confidence by pretending that you are confident. Tell yourself you can ask that girl you like on a date and, whatever she says, you won't care much. You can also expand your posture and actually feel more confident and powerful.[10] Open up your arms or place them behind your head, and push out your chest.\nDon't let your failures or limitations dictate who you are. Failure simply means that you are trying; it is something to learn from, not to avoid. Make sure to remind yourself that your failures do not define you unless you let them.\nHave faith in yourself. Courage involves trusting yourself and believing in yourself. Tell yourself that you have something to offer. Remember arrogance and confidence are different.[11]",
                "Build your courage for specific scenarios. It takes different kinds of courage to ask out someone you are interested in, to speak to your boss about a raise, or to confront a bully. One thing all of these scenarios will require is a show of confidence, whatever you actually feel. Confidence and courage come through acting as if you are unafraid, even (and especially) when you are.[12]",
                "Have courage when you ask someone out. When you ask someone out, the best way is to be direct, even if it is scary to put yourself out there. Practice what you're going to say ahead of time. If you can, talk to her in private. Think about how great it might be if she says yes; isn't that worth the risk?[13]\n\nRemember, if she says no, it isn't a reflection on you or your desirability. Be respectful of her decision and be proud of yourself for being courageous!",
                "Display courage when you speak up to your boss. It can be scary to talk to your supervisor, especially if it's about problems you're having at work; it's also awkward to have conversations about money. However, if you frame it more as a conversation than a confrontation, you may be more likely to get your way.[14]\n\nAsk to speak to her privately and plan out what you're going to say ahead of time. It's okay to feel nervous, don't fight it. Make sure to breathe normally and speak with conviction.\nIf the conversation backfires, step back and re-assess. If you think about it and feel that you were in the right, consider getting your human resources department involved.\nAlternatively, sometimes the better thing to do is change jobs; some people are very stubborn and choosing not to fight every battle doesn't mean that you lack courage.",
                "Show courage when you confront a bully. When you're confronting a bully, remember to act as if you're feeling brave and confident. You'll trick yourself (and her) into thinking you aren't afraid.[15] Bullies thrive on your emotional response, so don't give them the pleasure of a reaction. Act confident in yourself (even if you don't feel particularly confident).\n\n\nIf the bullying gets work in the aftermath of your confrontation, get help from a teacher or parent. Knowing when to get outside help is courageous in itself. It shows that you are being honest with yourself about the reality of the situation.",
                "Identify your fears. What is it that you are afraid of? Before you can overcome your fear and act courageously you need to know what makes you scared. There are a number of things that tend to make people afraid, including these:[16]\n\nHeights\nSnakes and/or spiders\nCrowds\nPublic speaking\nWater\nStorms\nClosed spaces",
                "Acknowledge your fear. Once you have identified your fears, do not try to brush them under the rug; do not avoid them. Do not try to convince yourself that you simply aren't afraid; it will take more work than that to conquer your fear. Instead, accept that you do have fears so you can work productively to overcome them.[17]\n\nYou can acknowledge your fear by writing it down or saying it out loud.\nYou can assess the degree to which you are afraid by writing down on a scale from 0 (not at all afraid) to 100 (very afraid), just how scared you are of the thing in question.",
                "Try gradual desensitization. In this technique, you slowly but increasingly allow yourself to approach or come into contact with whatever you are afraid of.[18]\n\nFor example, if you are afraid of leaving the house, you might start by putting on your shoes as if you were going to go outside, but not actually go outside.\nNext, you might open the door and take two steps outside, and then four steps, and then eight steps, and then walk down the block and back home.",
                "Try direct confrontation. This is also called \"flooding.\" Force yourself into the scenario you are afraid of and allow yourself to be fully afraid. Feel the fear pulsing through you; observe it but try your best not to be overcome by it. It can help if you imagine yourself in the 3rd person by saying things like, \"he seems really scared right now.\" [19]\n\nIn this method, if you were afraid of going outside, you would go out down the block on your first try. You would then try to think about how it actually isn't that bad to be away from home.\nYou would then repeat this process until you were completely unafraid of going outside.\nThe idea is to show you that there is no need to fear what you do; as such, this method is best used for irrational fears.",
                "Try visualization. When you find yourself afraid of something, try getting your mind off of it by focusing on more positive thoughts. Do your best to visualize something that makes you happy, such as your dog or a loved one. Use this positive emotion to overpower the fear. [20]\n\nVisualize the thing that makes you positive. Try to imagine it with multiple senses to make it more real.\nFor example, if you are thinking about your dog, think about how your dog smells, how she feels when you pet her, how she looks, and how she sounds.",
                "Talk to someone. Talking out your fears with someone, a licensed therapist, a trusted family member or friend can help you to figure out where your fear is originating; it can also help you overcome your fear and act courageously.[21][22]\nThere are also websites that you can use, if you need to talk anonymously.[23]\n\nIt may be time to talk to someone if you find that your fear is interfering with your life in a way that you want to change."

        "wikiHow to Write in Calligraphy": {
            "intro": "Calligraphy means “beautiful writing” in Greek and spans thousands of years and countless cultures. There are several styles, including Western, Eastern Asian, Southern Asian, and Islamic. All calligraphy uses the same basic principals to create beautiful lettering. If you want to practice the art of decorative handwriting, all you need to do is follow a few simple steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Hold your pen diagonally at a 30 to 60 degree angle. A calligraphy pen isn’t used quite the same way as a regular pen. The tip, or nib, of the pen should point diagonally away from you, to the left, as you write.[1]",
                "Don’t twist the nib as you write. The tip of writing tool used to do calligraphy is called a nib. Regardless of the letters you are forming, the orientation of the nib should remain consistent. Whether you’re doing straight lines or loops, the tip of the nib should always point in the same direction.[2]",
                "Lead the nib backwards or sideways across the paper. The nib should move backwards or sideways from the direction it’s pointing in. Pushing it forward away from your hand leads to blotting and uneven letter formation.[3]",
                "Apply light pressure. Using too much pressure can make for messy letters or scratches in your paper. Pressing too hard can also damage the nib, so do your best to apply the pen to the paper with a light, consistent pressure. Try not to lean heavily on your hand or forearm, either, which creates stilted lettering.[4]",
                "Keep your lines parallel. Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines in various letters should be parallel to corresponding lines in other letters. This will make your writing look more consistent and professional.[5]\n\nFor instance, try to make the vertical line the letter “d” parallel with the vertical line in the letter “b.”",
                "Trace the alphabet numerous times. Select and print a sample calligraphy alphabet and cover it with a piece of tracing paper. Try to recreate the strokes of the alphabet letters until you can successfully write the letters on your own.[6]",
                "Use the correct stroke order. Each letter or symbol will be made up of several different sections which are done in a single movement, called strokes. Practice upward and downward strokes until you can make them consistent. Keep in mind that when writing letters the stroke order is also important, and differs by style, so refer to a calligraphy guide to learn which strokes come first based on the letter.[7]\n\nFor instance, in Western calligraphy, write vertical lines first followed by horizontal lines, such as when writing the letter “t.”[8]\n\nIn Asian calligraphy, strokes begin at the top of the character and move downward to the to bottom of the character.[9]\n\nFor Islamic calligraphy, begin with the largest strokes of the letter and progress to the smallest strokes and dots.[10]",
                "Try the grid method. Set up a grid to practice with by filling a piece of paper with 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares. Use pencil to make the grid, then fill in each row with repeated versions of whichever letter you wish to practice until your strokes are even and clean-looking.[11]",
                "Use templates to perfect your spacing. Calligraphy templates will help you master letter formation and keep your spacing consistent. They also keep your letters and words from slanting up or down across the page. Do an Internet search for free guids or templates, or pick up a calligraphy guidebook to practice with.[12]",
                "Practice freehand. Once you get the hang of how to form calligraphy letters, practice writing notes, messages, or journal entries in calligraphy. Anything you need to write down can be done so in calligraphy to get you used to connecting different letters.[13]",
                "Choose smooth, acid-free, archival paper. Smooth paper will keep your writing utensil from catching or being redirected by the paper. Look for paper that’s labeled “acid-free” and “archival” to ensure that your image will age well. You will also want to look for paper which is labeled as “sized,” meaning it’s been treated to keep ink from bleeding.[14]\n\nAvoid paper that’s greasy or waxy, which can keep the paper from absorbing the ink.",
                "Get a proper writing utensil. While you can create calligraphy with any writing utensil, there are certain writing instruments which are considered better than others. Which you use, however, will depend upon what type of calligraphy you are doing and what writing utensil feels best to you.[15]\n\nDip pens are pens which you dip in ink. They consist of a wood, plastic or bone handle and a metal nib (the pointed end which will make contact with the paper). The nib is dipped in the ink and stores it in the well of the nib. These are often used in Islamic calligraphy.\nFountain pens are similar to dip pens but instead draw their ink from a container within the pen. While this ink will occasionally need to be replaced or refilled, it will save you the trouble of constantly needing to dip your pen. Fountain pens are commonly used for Western calligraphy.\nBrushes come in a variety of sizes but will usually all be roughly the same shape. These are dipped in ink and use the pressure and direction of the writer’s strokes to form the line variations. Brushes are often used for Asian calligraphy.",
                "Select the best ink for your style. There are many different types of ink and which one you choose will partially depend on what you are writing with. Inks will also come in a variety of colors but black is the most commonly used color in all styles of calligraphy.[16]\n\nPot ink is the most common ink used for calligraphy. This ink comes premixed in a small jar and your writing utensil will be dipped into it, such as for Islamic calligraphy. India ink is the most common type of pot ink used in calligraphy.\nFountain pen ink is a special kind of dye-based ink which is used for fountain pens, typically for Western calligraphy. It is important to use only fountain pen ink in these types of pens as other ink types will clog the pen. Fountain pen ink will come in either pre-loaded barrels, which you place in your pen, or pots, in which case you fill the pen yourself.\nInk sticks, which will also require an ink stone, are sticks of ink which must be ground and mixed with water in order to form the ink you will write with. They are an excellent option for calligraphers because they allow you to get many different tones from the same ink, depending on how it is mixed. These are often used in Asian calligraphy.",
                "Use rulers or other guide instruments for consistency. You may want rulers or T-guides to create guidelines for yourself and ensure that your writing is straight. Or perhaps you wish to write across a curved or circular line and need a reference. Even experts use rulers and other guide instruments to make their writing as beautiful and consistent as possible.[17]",
                "Keep your paper in place with tape or weights. Use painter’s tape or weights to hold the paper in place while you are writing. This will keep you from skewing or bumping the paper and messing up your letters. You can also use clips or a drawing board.[18]"

        "wikiHow to Avoid Getting Scammed on eBay": {
            "intro": "In an age where the bulk of informal market trading happens online, eBay is a pioneer. If you are an avid user of eBay, most of your experiences have probably been great! However, there is always the chance that you will be scammed, and, no matter how rare this chance is, you should be prepared for it. Here are a couple of different ways to avoid being scammed when buying or selling on eBay.",
            "steps": [
                "Safeguard your account. Before you even bid on your first item, make sure your PayPal and eBay settings are as secure as possible. It's not a bad idea to have an entirely separate email and bank account dedicated solely to your eBay transactions.\n\n\nThe same logic applies to your home address--especially if you're purchasing something from a long-distance seller, consider picking the package up at the post office. This method provides added security coupled with your retention of privacy.",
                "Familiarize yourself with common scams. If you don't know the playbook, you're liable to end up as a statistic in it. Most eBay scams that target buyers are centered around sending faulty products for an insane mark-up or simply not sending a product outright after payment is delivered. [1]\n\nThese kinds of scams happen most often with big-ticket items like cars or property, so if you must purchase a vehicle or something similar through eBay, be sure to insist on a mutual meeting place to do the transaction.\nYou can avoid most basic scams by simply requesting more information about the item and the terms of the item's sale. If the seller is reluctant to give you information or they appear evasive, you should give the item a pass.",
                "Scope out the user's account. While this isn't the most accurate way to determine whether or not someone is a scammer, it eliminates the possibility of buying from someone with a ton of negative reviews or a lack of history.\n\n\nThis precaution is mostly contextual, so be sure to ask questions. If you contact the seller and they tell you that they've been working on eBay for years when their account was registered last week, that should raise an immediate red flag.",
                "Pay attention to the terms of the transaction. If you don't read the fine print and somebody ships you a damaged or faulty item \"as is\", eBay won't side with you in a dispute. It's shady, but technically legal; therefore, you should spare yourself the trouble by reading through every single detail on the listing before you bid. [2]\n\nIf possible, request additional photos or information as well--again, if the seller is reluctant to accommodate your request, they're probably hiding something.",
                "Look for red flags. Before you even contact a seller, look for negative reviews, a lack of a refund policy, missing or vague information, or requests for money orders, checks, or other third-party payment methods.\n\n\nYou should also generally be on the lookout for things that simply sound too good to be true. If you see someone selling a piece of expensive hardware described as \"brand new\" for well under market price, it's probably a scam.",
                "Always pay through eBay-approved methods. PayPal and eBay both keep records of transactions, and you have access to these records at any time; going through third-party sites or payment methods is a surefire way to lose the support of both companies in the event of a scam.\n\n\nPay on collection of big-ticket merchandise such as cars, large furniture, or similar items. The easiest way to ensure the cooperation of both parties in an event like this is by meeting face-to-face in a neutral area with plenty of visibility--i.e., a shopping center. [3]",
                "Document everything. eBay and PayPal deal exclusively in written records, so if a seller wants to discuss business over the phone, politely explain this to them. They will likely be dissuaded if they are attempting to scam you.\n\n\nYou should keep any written records of transactions for at least a year after the transaction takes place, simply for insurance.",
                "Monitor your bank account and PayPal afterwards. In the days following your transaction, keep an eye out for any irregular activity in your bank accounts. If you spot any, contact PayPal, eBay, or your local branch and report the circumstances.",
                "Review your settings. Before you list an item for sale, make sure your refund policy, payment settings, and shipping information are all accurate. You don't want someone to accuse you of scamming them based on inaccurate information--in fact, some scammers will find ways to exploit errors like this to get eBay to side with them in a dispute, leading you to lose both money and your item.",
                "Set up dedicated bank and email accounts. While PayPal is relatively secure and eBay has a whole host of security benefits to keep your money safe, consider opening a separate account solely for transactions, complete with an accompanying email address.\n\n\nSeveral users have reported success in bypassing scams by having a PayPal-related email and an eBay-related email separate of one another; that way, if, for example, a buyer contacts the PayPal email with an inquiry, you automatically know it's a scam.",
                "Familiarize yourself with common scams. First and foremost, buyers are always looking for the best deal, so what you may interpret as a scam might be them simply trying to haggle the price. That said, most scams that are run on sellers tend to revolve around refusing to pay for an item or attempting to get their money back after purchasing said item. [4]\n\nThe most common scam is called the \"bait and switch refund\", in which a buyer complains about receiving a broken or faulty device after it ships. Since eBay is obligated to side with the buyer in the event that they provide proof--an easy enough process, since all they have to do is buy a broken version of whatever you sent them for practically nothing--you will be forced to pay them a refund. You can prevent this scam by either implementing a no-returns policy or by including buyer's insurance in the transaction.\nAnother common scam consists of buyers attempting to settle transactions outside of eBay--over the phone, for example--which leads to eBay having no written record of the transaction if they choose to scam you. To counteract this, never settle for anything less than a written record of your transactions, preferably through email.",
                "Implement a strict return policy. Generally speaking, you'll want to have some kind of return policy in the event that an honest mistake with shipping and handling happens. That said, be sure to state the terms of your return policy in your posting. This is an easy way to close any loopholes that scammers may try to exploit. [5]\n\nIf you're selling an expensive item--especially if it is rare--consider changing the terms of your listing to \"no refunds\". This may dissuade some genuine buyers, but it will also keep scammers away. You can always say \"more information upon request\" in your posting to counteract the harshness of this policy--honesty is on your side.",
                "Look for red flags. If a buyer refuses to pay through eBay-approved methods such as PayPal, they're probably hiding something. Similarly, if they want to settle outside of eBay or they give you an unconfirmed address, consider renegotiating. Chances are fairly high that they'll reconsider if you tell them you're worried about being scammed, but this method should scare off any actual scammers. [6]\n\nPayPal doesn't lie, and neither does eBay; email, however, might. To ensure that all of your emails regarding your account are correct, log into the pertaining service and check manually.\nAs a general rule, you should not accept money orders or checks of any kind--the risks are simply too high, even if your buyer's intentions are good.",
                "Wait to ship until you receive payment. As soon as you and your buyer settle on a price, have them transfer the money to PayPal. Once you see the transaction in progress on PayPal, you can ship your item--not a second before.\n\n\nYou'll have a written record of the time you send your package and the time that PayPal accepted the transfer, so as long as the two corroborate, you should be safe from any attempt at a scam.",
                "Use postage tracking. Services such as FedEx and UPS often give you the option of tracking your package along its route; take advantage of this system to ensure the package's arrival. If your buyer tells you it didn't arrive when UPS tells you it did, you'll know not to send them a refund. [7]\n\nOnce again, eBay and PayPal will usually back you up in this case, so long as you have retained all of your written records.",
                "Monitor your bank account and PayPal afterwards. In the days following your transaction, keep an eye out for any irregular activity in your bank accounts. If you spot any, contact PayPal, eBay, or your local branch and report the circumstances."

        "How to Treat Eczema Around the Eyes": {
            "intro": "Eczema is a catch-all phrase for several skin problems. These include \"contact dermatitis,\" a skin reaction to an allergen or harsh substance, but eczema around the eyes is usually \"atopic\" dermatitis, meaning the skin reacted without any direct contact. This skin condition most often shows up in babies and children.[1] However, no matter how old you are, you can end up with a flare-up of atopic dermatitis around your eyes, and you need a way to treat it.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the basics. Atopic dermatitis is a skin condition that most often appears in childhood. It is related to environmental allergies, hay fever, and asthma, meaning that if you develop one of these conditions, you are more likely to develop the other conditions.[2]\n\nAtopic dermatitis is an immune response. Typically, an irritant (called the \"precipitant\" or immediate cause) comes into contact with your body. The body gets confused and overreacts, causing inflammation of the skin even in areas that weren't exposed.[3]",
                "Know the symptoms. If you develop acute (short-term) eczema, you may see small, red, itchy bumps on your skin. There might also be some swelling and scaling. If the eczema continues, the symptoms may reach the chronic stage, developing into itchy, thicker patches of skin that turn brownish or reddish.[4]\n\nIn addition, the bumps may weep, meaning they produce liquid. You may also have scaly, dry skin.[5]",
                "Learn how eczema acts. Atopic dermatitis can come and go over time. When the symptoms are worse, it's called a flare-up. However, you can go for long periods when you may exhibit no symptoms.[6]",
                "Understand how atopic dermatitis is passed. This condition is not contagious, meaning you can't catch it by coming in contact with someone who has it. However, it can be passed genetically from parent to child.[7]",
                "Be aware how atopic dermatitis can affect your vision. This condition can cause problems with your vision. If you think your vision is being affected by a recent flare-up, always speak with your doctor.[8]\n\nOne way it affects your vision is the skin around your eyes can be red and puffy, making it difficult to see. However, this disease has also been linked to a higher occurrence of cataracts and spontaneous retinal detachment, even when treated.[9]",
                "Use an ice pack or cold compress around your eyes. Application of cold causes temporary numbness of the nerve endings, leading to reduced sensation, soothing the skin, and reducing your urge to itch. It also helps in sloughing off dead skin, leading to a smoother appearance and quicker healing.[10]\n\nPut cold water in a bowl with some bath oil.[11] If you want it colder, you can add some ice to the water.\nSoak a paper towel or clean washcloth in the water. Hold it on your face over the affected area for about 5 minutes.[12]",
                "Apply a moisturizer to your face. A cream or ointment is best, as they have more oil than lotions, which are heavier on water. The oil helps protect and moisturize your skin better.[13]\n\nPick a cream that is fragrance-free, and make sure to keep it out of your eyes when applying it.\nApply moisturizers as often as your skin feels dry. Applying it after a shower or washing your face is especially effective. These moisturizers soften skin and help heal and prevent flare-ups.[14]",
                "Use a corticosteroid cream intended for eyes. One of the most effective treatments for atopic dermatitis is corticosteroid cream, which can help flare-ups go into remission.[15] Only use low-strength preparations intended for use around the eye. (These may be labeled for \"ophthalmic\" use.)\n\n\nHowever, this treatment becomes more difficult when the eczema is on or near the eyes. Your skin is not as thick in these areas, so using it for prolonged periods can be more dangerous. You should ask your doctor before using a cream near your eyes and limit your use around your eyes to 2 weeks or less.[16]\n\nTry to keep the corticosteroid cream out of your eyes when applying it.",
                "Stay healthy and comfortable. Stress can make your eczema worse, as can exposure to chemical irritants. Because of this, it often helps to use a holistic medicine approach. Aromatherapy, massage, and similar techniques can help reduce stress and potentially bolster your immune system. Many alternative medicine skin preparations are soothing and irritant-free, such as a light layer of unrefined coconut oil.[17]\n\nIf you are currently taking medication for your eczema, consult your doctor before taking any dietary supplements or skin care treatments, including herbal remedies.\nEssential oils are highly concentrated and should not be used undiluted, especially around sensitive areas such as the eyes. Even when diluted, take care not to let any get in your eyes.[18]",
                "Ask about oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are sometimes used when you get an infection related to your dermatitis. Because the eye area is more sensitive, your doctor may want to prescribe you an antibiotic if you develop dermatitis around one or both of your eyes.[19]",
                "Avoid known allergens. Eczema is often caused by exposure to an allergen. Avoiding your personal triggers is the number one strategy for controlling flare-ups. If you know you are sensitive to certain substances, do your best to avoid them.\n\n\nRemember that the allergen does not need to come into contact with the affected skin. Your body can detect the allergen in one location and react with a flare up in a different place.",
                "Keep stress levels at a minimum. Stress can increase flare-ups, so try to keep stress levels down. Learn techniques to keep you or your child more even throughout the day.[20]\n\nIdentify stressors. When your stress levels are running high, think about what's affecting them. Write about what makes you worried or excited, and think about what you can do to reduce the stress of that event. For instance, if you find your job stressful, maybe you can reduce stress by asking your boss if you can telecommute once a week.[21]\n\nTry conscious breathing to calm yourself. Take a moment to close your eyes. Let your breathing fill up your mind. Focus on slow, deep breaths, and think only about your breathing. Keep focusing until you feel yourself calming down.[22]\n\nTry animal sounds with your kids to meditate. Have them breathe in deeply while raising their arms. As they lower them, have them make extended sounds such as hissing or buzzing. This exercise helps them slow down their breathing and takes their mind off of what is stressing them out.[23]",
                "Don't scratch. Scratching will only make the rash worse. In fact, when eczema appears near the eyes, scratching can cause swelling, as well as make the skin red and puffy.[24]\n\nScratching can also cause you to lose part of your eyebrows and eyelashes.[25]\n\nIf you or your child scratches at night, try wearing gloves or trimming your fingernails to help reduce the problem.[26]",
                "Take an antihistamine. Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as loratadine and fexofenadine, can help control the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Because this disease is related to other types of allergic reactions such as hay fever, antihistamines can provide relief, especially for the itching.[27]\n\nFollow the directions for the antihistamine you chose. With most non-drowsy antihistamines, you take them once day. Begin a regimen when you have a flare-up.[28]\n\nHowever, if you're having trouble sleeping because of your eczema, an antihistamine that caused drowsiness can be helpful to take at night.[29]",
                "Identify allergens and irritants. Allergens and irritants can contribute to flare-ups. Sometimes changing a product such as laundry detergent or soap may help in treatment of eczema. Attempt to isolate what causes you issues by slowly switching out products to help determine what bothers you.[30] While you are having a flare-up, it's best to skip make-up altogether.[31]\n\nIt may help to keep a diary recording the food, perfume, scents, and other substances you come into contact with, along with the eczema flare-ups you experience. Look for patterns in the substances you contact in the days before a flare-up.[32]\n\nYou can visit an allergy specialist to help identify your allergies.\nThe face and eye area can be especially problematic because so many products are applied in this area, particularly on women. Sunscreen, make-up, soaps, and fragrances can all cause flare-ups.[33]",
                "Avoid certain foods. While food allergies have a specific definition (they cause an immediate reaction), foods can contribute to flare-ups. Most common allergens are found in peanuts, egg, milk, fish, rice, soy and wheat.\n\n\nIf you're breastfeeding a child with eczema, you should avoid tree nuts, as you can pass them to your child.[34]",
                "Pick a soap that is extra moisturizing. When washing your face, choose a soap that has a high fat content, rather than one that dries out your face. Also, pick one that is unscented.[35]\n\nSkip soaps that are antibacterial, as they can dry out your skin.[36] Also, avoid soaps that have alpha-hydroxy acid, as it can also remove moisture from your skin.[37] Look for cleansers that say \"gentle\" and \"fragrance-free.\"",
                "Avoid frequent baths and showers. Too much hot water and soap can make eczema worse, especially in the delicate skin around the eyes. Lower the temperature of the water and wash less frequently, or take baths without soaking the affected skin.",
                "Use a humidifier. Hot, dry air can irritate your skin and make itching and flaking worse. If necessary, run a humidifier to add moisture to the air.[38]",
                "Keep your skin away from sunlight and extreme heat. This goes from anything from hot showers to direct sunlight, to hot climates.\n\n\nUse lukewarm water when you shower or wash your face. Avoid hot water, which can irritate your sensitive skin.[39]\n\nDon't spent too much time in hot weather; the heat can easily irritate your skin and cause more inflammation."

        "How to Ride a Bike Safely": {
            "intro": "Riding your bike can be a great deal of fun, and it's a brilliant way to keep fit. Nevertheless, bike riding has its hazards, especially when you're sharing the road with motorized traffic. To keep safe, it is important to have a bike in top condition and to pay attention to some basic but very important cycling requirements when sharing your ride with the general traffic.",
            "steps": [
                "Check your cycling equipment. Before you even set out, it is important to ensure that your bike is roadworthy and safe. This is especially important for aging bikes. Checking your bike means looking at the following:\n\n\n\nAir -- are your tires inflated adequately?\n\nBrakes - do they work, are they clean?\n\nChain - is it clean, free of debris, and able to turn with no problems?",
                "Check the brakes. Wheel your bike around a flat surface, pulling the brake levers on and off. If they do not work, and you're not sure how to fix them, contact your local bike shop and ask them to help.",
                "Check the bike's tires. Put the whole tire into a small bowl of water. See if there are any bubbles coming out. If there are any bubbles, it means your tire is punctured and you can get it fixed by a bike shop or do it yourself. Repeat for the other tire.",
                "See if the bike is the right height for you. This is very easy as all you need to do is sit on your bike and make sure that the tips of your toes touch the ground (and nothing else). Adjust the bike seat as needed, and the handles too.",
                "Wear bright clothing, a reflective vest, or have flashing lights. These all increase your visibility. When buying t-shirts or tops make it a policy to buy bright or at least white colours. You can also add reflector lights or reflective tape to your backpack if you're wearing one.",
                "Wear comfortable shoes. Riding a bike in high heels or flip flops is never a good idea. Wear shoes that fit snugly, are flat soled, and have no dangling pieces that could become caught in the bike structure and spokes. Tuck in laces.",
                "Use trouser elastics or ties. They will hold back long pants that are threatening to flap into the wheel spokes, or become dirtied by the chain grease.",
                "Don't tie clothing around your waist. It could unexpectedly come loose and wrap around your wheel, throwing you head-first into the ground or road. It could also become entangled in the chain or obscure your rear light and reflector.",
                "Wearing a helmet is always a good idea when cycling. In some places, you have no choice but to wear a helmet by law. Yet, even where this is not legally required, it's a good idea to wear one to augment your safety - head injuries are the most common fatal injuries sustained in bike accidents.[2]",
                "Wear eye protection. Dirt, pebbles, or even bugs can fly into your eyes, causing temporary vision difficulty. A pair of bicycle-appropriate glasses will help prevent this.",
                "Know the rules and use your senses. Every cyclist has a duty to know the road rules, both as they apply to you as a cyclist, and as they relate to other road users as well. This includes teaching children what rules they need to be aware of (see below). It is also important to use common sense when riding in traffic, relying on all of your senses to help guide you through traffic safely. Anticipate the unexpected to reduce surprises.",
                "Ride in the direction of the traffic. Riding against traffic on the wrong side of the road is illegal and increases a cyclist's risk dramatically because it increases closing speeds and turning motorists are likely to not even look for traffic in the direction from which a wrong-way cyclist would be coming.",
                "Prior to adjusting course left or right, always first look back behind you to make sure it's clear, and then signal your intent. Learn to be able to turn your head to look back behind you without veering off course. This can be done by practicing looking back while following a stripe in an empty parking lot. This skill is essential any time you need to move left or right from your course, like when you need to move over for a truck stopped at the curb or some other obstacle. Just because it's not your fault that you need to change course, does not mean that you have right of way to move over. If other traffic is using the adjacent line of travel, you need to yield to them, or negotiate for right of way to move there (see below). It's important to practice the looking back skill because many cyclists, even experienced ones, don't realize how much they veer when they look back. Looking back to make sure it's safe to move over is of no help if you veer left right in front of overtaking traffic as you look back.",
                "Signal your intentions to other road users. That is to say when turning or adjusting laterally on the roadway. Holding your arm straight and parallel to the ground with open palm faced forward is much more clear and attention-grabbing than an arm halfheartedly lifted and held in position with a bent elbow. Before taking your hand off the handlebar, be sure to scan the road ahead for obstructions like stones, potholes, or anything that can jerk your wheel. Not only does signaling let them predict your next move, but it gives cyclists a reputation of courtesy.",
                "Stop for stop signs and watch for traffic.",
                "Obey traffic signals.",
                "Do not listen to music whilst cycling. Not only do your ears act like a radar for detecting approaching cars, certain types of music can encourage you to take excessive risks!",
                "Choose a conspicuous lane position. Realize that many motorists may overlook cyclists, especially those riding inconspicuously near the road edge. Some motorists are irritated by the presence of cyclists and seek to make it harder for you to drive near them. Don't get angry; if they honk that means they've noticed you! Convey gratitude by smiling, nodding or waving. Stay calm, keep your wits about you, and remain focused. A mirror can help you know when a motorist is approaching from behind. A well-timed look back, nod or even slow/stop arm signal can be very helpful in communicating to the motorist that you are not oblivious to their presence and your effect on them, which alone can often nip-in-the-bud a potential road rage situation.",
                "Track your tires at least five feet from the side of cars parked at the curb to eliminate the risk of being struck, or being caused to swerve in front of overtaking traffic, by a suddenly opened door. Remember that even at 10 mph you're traveling the distance of an entire car length every second. If a door opens suddenly in front of you, you may not even have enough time to react, much less stop. And if you instinctively swerve or are knocked left by the opening door, you could be hit by overtaking traffic. Sure, they're legally obligated to look first before they open the door, but are you going to trust your safety - perhaps even betting your life - that they always will without exception? If you regularly ride in door zones, it's only a matter of time before you get doored. Since car and truck doors extend out as much as three-and-a-half feet when open, tracking five feet away allows your two foot wide body to be clear of an open door plus a minimum of six inches of error margin. Any closer than five feet puts you in the door zone and in serious risk. Don't be lured into riding in a door zone by a bike lane. That paint on the ground offers no protection!",
                "Don't try to share lanes with other traffic that are too narrow for safe side-by-side sharing. Riding far right in lanes less than 14 feet (4.3 m) in width is a great cause of conflict and consternation in traffic. It makes the cyclist less conspicuous and invites motorists to try to squeeze into the lane side-by-side with the cyclist, causing them to either pass with insufficient safety margin, or realize too late that they have to at least encroach in the adjacent lane to pass safely. Alert them early of the condition that lane sharing is not an option by clearly controlling the lane by riding near the center of the lane, or even left of center, so they have the time and space to plan a safe lane change and pass.",
                "Share the road wisely. Between intersections when faster traffic is present, if the traffic lane is wide enough for traffic to pass you safely within the lane, keep to the side and make it easier for the drivers to leave you room. But during significantly long gaps in traffic, a more conspicuous position well out in the traffic lane helps grab the attention of the next driver who approaches, discouraging them from choosing to attend to a distraction until after you've been safely passed. A rear view mirror can help you notice when faster traffic is approaching, and to let you known when to move aside, usually after they've slowed indicating they've noticed you, but before they get irritated. Never use a rear view mirror glance in place of a head-turn look back prior to moving laterally on the roadway.",
                "Know that most of the risk is in front of you, especially from traffic turning and crossing across your path. As you approach any intersection, junction or place where turns may be made, regardless of your intended direction, choose a conspicuous and predictable lane position with plenty of buffer space around you. The savvy cyclist adjusts for the proper position at least 100–200 feet (30.5–61.0 m) prior to the intersection, if she is not already positioned there prior to that.",
                "Watch for cars on your right that are turning right. Turning motorists often check only for traffic where vehicular traffic is expected, sometimes overlooking pedestrians or cyclists positioned elsewhere. But sometimes they overlook even properly positioned cyclists (just like motorcyclists or even cars are sometimes overlooked), which is why the extra buffer space is important. Look for evidence that you've been noticed - and eye contact does not count (someone can look right at you and still not \"see\" you) - before relying on being noticed. Pay attention to where they are looking, which way their tires are turned, if they're rolling or completely stopped, etc. It's only a matter of time before someone overlooks you and cuts you off... so be ready and not surprised when it happens!",
                "Moving laterally on the roadway sometimes requires not only looking back and signalling, but often negotiation is entailed. Remember that signalling your intent to move does not give you the right of way to move. Any traffic already moving into that space needs to yield to you first. So signal clearly and look back, waiting for others to yield to you before moving. If you need to traverse across several lanes, move with looking back, signalling and negotiation for each lane change, one at a time, just as you would if riding a motorcycle.",
                "If you are turning left, use the left turn lane. Start preparing early so you have plenty of time and space to move across the road one lane a time with signalling and negotiation as needed. If you are not comfortable with this, pull over, get off your bike and walk it through the intersection using crosswalks based on pedestrian rules of the road.",
                "If you are going straight, don't use the right turn lane or the part of the road normally used by right-turning traffic. Other drivers are likely to not expect straight-through traffic to be traveling there. Prior to the intersection, move left if you're not already controlling the rightmost lane that goes straight.",
                "Don't pass slowing or stopped traffic on the right that can and might turn right. Instead, merge left to get behind them, or even further left to pass them on the left. Beware of motorists that pass you, and then slow down enough for you to catch up and start passing them... on the right. More often than not, they are slowing in order to turn right... that's you're cue to look back and merge left to pass them on the left. Don't shoot the gap! If you are passing stopped cars on the right, beware of the possibility of a passenger door suddenly opening - especially if it's a taxi. Passing on the left, with more than four feet of passing space, is much safer, and usually faster.",
                "Know the speed limits. It is important for you as a cyclist to avoid speeding, and to obey all speed limits in slow zones (such as around pedestrian crossings, and school zones).",
                "Know when to ride on the road, on the shoulder or in the bike lane. The rules will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but, generally, shoulder use is optional but never required, and bike lane use is generally only mandatory when faster traffic is present and they can be safely and reasonably used. Beware of glass, rubble and other debris that tends to collect in shoulders and bike lanes because they are not being continually swept clean by vehicular traffic as the rest of the road is. Take into account the extra risk you assume by riding as far right as bike lanes and shoulders usually are because you are less conspicuous there (less conspicuous to drivers approaching from behind as well as to those ahead of you). Being so far right also shortens your sight lines to potential hazards in front of you, and reduces the amount of safety/buffer space between you and potential hazards near the edge of the road. In short, decide where to ride by imagining where you would ride if there was no stripe per the considerations given above, and ride there. Remember that stripes are in fixed locations, and the best location for you to ride depends on the current situation and conditions, so don't blindly rely on bike lane stripes for guidance.",
                "Don't ride in bike lanes that are marked within the door zone of parked cars. Remember that bike lanes are usually only 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) wide, so even if it's a relatively wide 5' bike lane adjacent to parked cars, you should not ride in that bike lane. The closest you should be to the parked cars is by tracking on the bike lane stripe.",
                "Use of cycle tracks running next to the road are rarely legally required, but can be preferred, especially for relatively slow recreational riding. Even more than when riding in bike lanes, be aware of the additional risk assumed by riding where traffic is easily overlooked, whenever approaching any intersection with a road or driveway.",
                "Avoid cycling on the sidewalk or footpath. Generally, it is not a good idea to ride on the sidewalk and in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to do so. One clear exception to this is where a sidewalk has been specifically designated as a marked bike path but be careful still, as it is likely you will still need to share it with pedestrians, as well as cyclists coming in the opposite direction. On the whole, many roads are generally smoother, making the ride easier, quicker, and more comfortable than trying to navigate a bumpy, frequently obstructed sidewalk.",
                "Take extra caution when cycling in wet conditions. This is especially true if these are the first rains for some time: oil and grease in the tarmac is free to float on the surface. Therefore do not lean into curves and be wary of slick markings and drain covers. In icy conditions extreme caution is required, but consider delaying your journey until after midday or canceling it altogether. Having large wheels will help you ride in wet conditions.",
                "Cross railway/railroad lines at right angles. The tyres can otherwise get caught in the tracks, or when wet the wheels will slip.",
                "Always carry identification, like a medical ID bracelet or ID card in your seat bag. This can be invaluable to EMS responders if you're unconscious.",
                "Use appropriate lighting. Motorcycles are required to have a front headlight on at all times, because they are smaller and harder to see than other vehicles. A bicycle is smaller yet. Nighttime riding usually requires a front white light as a minimum, although adding other lights will help to increase your visibility, along with reflective clothing as discussed above. Lighting is useful both for day and for night riding:\n\n\nDuring the day, a flashing front light is good because it attracts more attention.\nAt night, use a constant front light rather than a flashing one. Its steady stream of light will provide adequate visibility to drivers, while a flashing front light at night soon gets to be annoying as it strobes your view.\nWhenever it gets dark outside, turn on your headlight. This means the moment that you feel your eyes straining to see well, even if the sky is not pitch black; remember too that drivers need to see you during twilight, so err on the side of turning on the light earlier rather than later.\nPut a red LED strobe or beacon on the back of your bike or your helmet. It is OK for this light to flash or have special patterns, because it disrupts night vision less than the white front lights, and because drivers do not count exclusively on your rear light to gauge their distance.",
                "Use conspicuous lane positioning. Riding a few feet one way or the other might not seem like it should make a big difference in terms of being seen since you should be in someone's field of view either way, until you think about drivers' \"zone of attention\" rather than their field of view. Being within their field of view is usually not enough to be noticed - you have to be in a place that makes you relevant to them to be noticed - be where they are paying most of their attention. While being in the \"motorcyclist position\" in the traffic lane does not guarantee that you'll be noticed, it makes being overlooked much less likely, and gives you a better vantage and more buffer space from hazards. Also, if you have a mirror, being well out in the lane makes it easy to determine when you are noticed, since motorists obviously slow down when they notice a cyclist up ahead in \"their lane\". If you're off to the side, then they often don't slow down even if they do notice you, so you have no way to discern those who have not noticed you from those who have. You can always temporarily move aside to let faster traffic pass, as being conspicuously well out in the traffic lane is the best way to be noticed.",
                "Take care at night. Cycling at night can be extremely dangerous. Always travel on a well lit road or path with no debris or potholes. Go slower than you would in the daytime, as you still need enough time to react to danger, and the lower visibility makes night cycling dangerous for this reason.",
                "Use hand signals properly. Hand signals are vital if you are going to turn. This is especially important for left turns, because they involve crossing traffic. Ignore what you were told in elementary school; instead, if you are turning left, extend your left arm, and if you are turning right, extend your right arm. Signals that were once based on the left arm were devised for driving a car, a situation where only the left arm can reach out the window.",
                "Give adequate warning. When you are passing pedestrians or other cyclists, it is essential that you warn them of your presence. Not only is this polite, but it reduces the chance of collisions, because pedestrians are less likely to suddenly swerve into your way, and they may move over, keeping you out of traffic. A bell, or a loud voice \"On your [Left / Right]\", \"Passing\" are good ways to attract attention.",
                "Watch for parked vehicles. When riding past parallel-parked vehicles, leave enough room for the vehicle door to swing completely open just as you are about to pass. Getting \"doored\" can cause serious injury and even death.",
                "Teach your children how to ride safely in a completely safe place. Let children learn at their own pace and offer lots of encouragement. They will fall off, so be prepared with hugs and motivational talk to get them back to trying. Be patient at all times.",
                "Ensure that children always wear a helmet when riding. This should feel like \"second nature\" to them.",
                "Explain to older children that riding at high speed could seriously hurt them. Discourage them from doing this and warn them about the dangers of not holding onto the handle bars or going down steep hills too fast.",
                "Find safe places for children to ride for fun, and safe routes to school and other places. As a person responsible for your children's well being, it is up to you to take the time to scout out good routes and places with your children where they can ride in safety."

        "How to Juggle": {
            "intro": "Juggling is a challenging but rewarding hobby; studies show that people who learn to juggle increase their brains' grey matter![1] While juggling may seem and be difficult to master at first, it becomes easier once you've learned the basics and practiced it. This article takes you into the basics of three-ball juggling, after which you can begin to introduce more balls.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose suitable balls. Beanbags are good for beginners. Basically, find balls that will not bounce a lot, or roll away when they're dropped––this will save a fair bit of running initially! A set of beanbags can be bought for a very low price or made by hand. Tennis balls filled with sand or a few pennies and covered with a round balloon also work well. They don't bounce and they provide a slip-free grip.\n\n\nWhile you're at it, choose a suitable place to work in. At the very beginning, balls will end up flying everywhere, so it's best not to stand near granny's precious oil lamp or dad's collection of ceramic cows.",
                "Toss one ball for a while to get the feel of juggling. Start passing one ball from one hand to the other. Also practice \"selfies\" –– these are throws you catch with the throwing hand. The ball should come to eye-height or higher. Your hands should not move very much, so aim to keep your elbows at your hips.",
                "Practice scooping. This is a technique to make juggling smooth. Simply scoop, or dip, your hand before tossing the ball. Keep the dip shallow though; it isn't going to work if you scoop too deeply. Practice scooping and tossing from one hand to another, so that arc does not rise above eye level.\n\nSimply mimic the movements of jugglers. If you were to \"air juggle,\" do you find yourself moving your hands in small circles? You're already scooping!",
                "Take one ball in each hand. Toss ball A, and when it reaches the top of its arc, toss ball B. Practice until this simple exchange becomes comfortable.\n\n\nAt the top is key here. This will give you the most time for your next catch. When you start working with 3, 4, and 5, this becomes especially important.",
                "Juggle three balls. Try to make three passes in a row. Start out slowly, simply seeing how the three work together in the air in one rotation. Juggling three is often a matter of understanding the balls' trajectories and how they intertwine. For the majority of the time, one will be in the air while each hand has the other two.\n\nFirst hold two balls in right hand and one in left-hand. (Vice versa if you are left handed.)\nBegin with passing from the right hand. (Again, vice versa if you are left-handed.)\nThrow the ball to your left hand and when ball 1 is at the peak, throw ball 2 (the only one in your left hand) under ball 1 to your right hand.\nWhen ball 2 is at the highest point (at this point, you should also catch ball 1 in the left hand) throw ball 3 under ball 2.\nAnd when ball 2 is in the right hand just catch ball 3 and this should be it. That's all you do! Repeat away.\n\nIf you can't seem to get the hang of it, work with light, small scarves. They'll give you the time hanging in the air to understand how it all comes together.",
                "Work on the over-the-top method. Now that you've got the simple three-ball cascade down, start juggling \"over the top.\" This is the name for scooping in the opposite direction with one hand. Instead of scooping under and releasing the ball, you catch it, scoop to the outside and throw it over, hence the name.\n\nYou can start by juggling a normal \"Three Ball Cascade,\" and then letting one of the balls do an over-the-top all the time, so that 1/3 of all throws are over-the-top throws. If you make one hand throw over-the-top throws every time, you are juggling a \"Slow Shower,\" and if every throw is an over-the-top-throw, you are juggling a \"Reverse Three Ball Cascade.\" When you have learned this, you can advance onto things like cross hand juggling, columns (one in the middle, two on the sides), and \"Mills' Mess.\"",
                "Move onto four and five balls. Learn to juggle two in one hand, then do two in your left hand and two in your right hand at the same time. For some, juggling four is simpler than three!\n\nJuggling five balls is just like juggling three, but you have to move your hands a lot faster and you need to throw the balls higher. Keep practicing –– it takes time and patience to master."

        "wikiHow to Survive Without a Girlfriend or Boyfriend": {
            "intro": "Are you one of those people who believes you cannot survive without a girlfriend or boyfriend? Maybe you have been couples up since your preteen years and have recently endured a breakup. Or, maybe you have never been in a serious relationship and worry what this means. The jury's out and the verdict is in: being single can be wonderful. Learn how to make the most out of your unattached relationship status.",
            "steps": [
                "Pursue hobbies. All people - single and not - need creative outlets to minimize stress, generate happy vibes, and connect with those around you. Relationships can become a detriment when people are so immersed in \"we\" that they forget about the \"I\". Relish in your singlehood by taking time out to do the things you enjoy whether it is crafting, canoeing, or writing poems.[1]",
                "Attend cultural events in your area. Who says being single means missing out on fun? Get out of the house and take advantage of the events offered in your local community or the surrounding cities. Tour a museum you've never been to. Make plans with your best buds to attend an upcoming concert or music festival.\n\n\nGoing to the ballet, opera, or art gallery is actually good for you! Research shows a connection between attending cultural activities and better self-reports of overall health.[2]",
                "Learn to enjoy solitude. If you have been in a relationship for many years, you may not remember how to be alone. You may even hate being alone. Yes, spending time with others is important, but solitude is an essential aspect of personal growth. Read, watch movies, or simply sit on your patio and enjoy the setting sun.\n\n\nTake 5-10 minutes out of each day to sit alone and reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and opinions of the day. If the process of being alone makes you uncomfortable, write about the experience. Why is it hard for you? What exactly about being alone don't you like?[3]",
                "Appreciate the benefits of being single. Challenge the idea that single is \"bad\". Not having a significant other is a choice just the same as where you live or work. You can fully enjoy your single life - whether it is decidedly temporary or permanent. Here are a few things single people have to their advantage:[4]\n\nThe ability to pursue passions and interests\nThe ability to be totally spontaneous - no need to coordinate with another\nThe option to figure out what you want before entering another relationship\nThe freedom to live life on your own terms\n\nThe ability to casually date, if you want",
                "Cultivate supportive relationships. You may not have a girlfriend or boyfriend, but you can always enrich the friendships and close family relationships you have. Especially when you're young, romantic relationships may come and go. Friends and family, on the other hand, may stick with you for life.\n\n\nYou don't necessarily need a relationship to be happy. Humans do, however, have a natural need to belong and connect. Invest time and effort in your close relationships. If or when you do enter a new romantic relationship, you will have a healthier outlook and expectations if you have nurtured your preexisting relationships.[5]",
                "Get a furry companion. If you are single and live alone, the solitude may be overwhelming. Aim for a careful balance of spending time alone and spending time with others so you don't drive yourself stir crazy. Sciences tells us that those who are isolated, particularly older adults, have a higher incidence of death.[6]\n\nA soft and cuddly cat or dog may make a great companion to cozy up to at night while watching Netflix. Plus, pet owners tend to be healthier and happier.[7]",
                "Recognize that only you can determine your worthiness. Not having a partner does not mean you don't belong or are unlovable. Oftentimes, people mistakenly allow their relationship status to determine their self-worth. Thinking \"I'm nothing without a boyfriend\" will only reinforce the idea that somehow you are not as worthy while single. Avoid this by purposely seeking out ways you are worthy of love, respect, and a wonderful life.\n\n\nTake an inventory of your personal strengths. What do you have to offer the world and the people around you? Write down your best qualities and paste them on a mirror or wall so that you can see them daily.[8]\n\nDo you find it difficult to assess your best attributes? Turn to a close friend or relative ans ask them to share a few qualities they admire about you.",
                "Don't feel the need to be attached because your friends are. When you are the only single and everyone around you is coupled, you can easily start to think being in a relationship is the way to go. Don't. Romantic relationships take a lot of hard work, compromise, and commitment. They are far from easy. If you're not ready to be paired off, don't let jealousy or fear push you into a relationship just to avoid sticking out.[9]",
                "Expand your social circle. If all of your friends are currently in relationships, and you're tired of being the third-wheel, it may be a good idea for you to hang out with others who are single. This is not to say that you should abandon your existing friendships. However, you may have more fun spending time with teens or young adults who are participating in solo activities.[10]\n\nTry striking up conversations with other guys or girls in your classes or at your jobs. When people occasionally invite you to events that you and your group wouldn't normally attend, say \"yes\". Spending time with more singles may help you to realize just how wonderful being unattached can be.",
                "Date yourself. The typical dating process gives you the chance to get to know the other person's personality traits, likes, dislikes, dreams, and opinions. Becoming acquainted with one another helps establish that romantic bond. Date yourself with the goal to get to know yourself better and begin a journey of self-fulfillment that does not rely on the presence of another.[11]\n\nWays to date yourself might include trying new restaurants, going to the movies alone, taking a class solo, traveling on your own, and buying yourself little gifts or flowers. Doing this reinforces the idea that you must love yourself first to effectively love someone else.",
                "Fight stress.[12][13] It is common for people in relationships to get caught up in serving their partners that they may neglect their own well-being. This neglect feels ten times worse once the relationship ends. Surviving and thriving as a single person means taking good care of yourself. Identify the things in your life causing you stress and build a toolbox with healthy coping strategies.\n\n\nPractice regular self-care to fend of stress before it jeopardizes your health. Come up with a few activities that you find relaxing to perform on a daily or weekly basis. Calling a friend, getting a massage, taking long walks, and reading are all positive ways to manage stress.",
                "Stay active. This advice is not intended to help you lose weight for revenge against an ex or to pick up your next boyfriend or girlfriend. Getting regular physical exercise is a necessary component for optimal physical and mental well-being. Plus, you feel better, form connections with others, and boost your self-confidence when you work out.\n\n\nDevelop a routine that includes at least five 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercises, such as running, cycling, or dancing, in addition to a minimum of 2 sessions of strength training exercises per week for optimal health.[14]",
                "Eat well. Just as you should get your body moving to care for yourself, you must also be mindful of the fuel you are giving it. Fuel your body with a balanced selection of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Consume between 3 and 5 meals per day.[15]",
                "Sleep plenty. The practice of self-love also extends to getting yourself to bed at a decent hour so that you can clock between 7 and 9 hours of shut-eye each night.\n\n\nIt's understandable if your single person's social calendar is full and you are developing the habit of staying out late and sleeping in. However, you should know that adequate sleep is significant for attention and concentration, memory, mood, and weight. Get yourself to bed around the same time each night and rise at the same time each morning for best results.[16]"

        "wikiHow to Clean Grout": {
            "intro": "Grout, the mixture of water, sand, and cement that keeps tiles in place, can be difficult to keep clean. Grout lines easily pick up dirt and stains, and before you know it they turn from white to black. Learn how to clean your grout so it's sparkling white again and maintain it so you don't have to clean it as often.",
            "steps": [
                "Do a preliminary clean. Before you get down to the deep cleaning methods, it is necessary to do a regular clean up of your tile. Follow your regular cleaning process of wiping down counters or sweeping and mopping floors. This will get all the top layer of scum off, and make your work a bit easier.",
                "Create your solution. In a bucket or large bowl, mix 7 cups of warm water, 1/2 cup of baking soda, 1/3 cup of ammonia, and 1/4 cup of white vinegar. Allow all the ingredients to mix completely, so the baking soda is dissolved.",
                "Pour the mixture in a spray bottle. Keeping this in a spray bottle will make it easy to mist the dirtiest areas specifically, and for storage. Fill your spray bottle completely, and then shake the solution well.",
                "Spray the grout. Start on a small area, only as large as 1-2 square feet total. Spray your cleaning solution over the grout so it is dampened. Allow the mixture to set for 3-5 minutes to work into the grout.",
                "Begin scrubbing. Use a scrubbing brush of your choice - a hard bristled cleaning brush, a toothbrush, or a magic eraser are all good options. Put some hard work into your scrubbing to get the ground-in dirt out from between your tiles.",
                "Clean up the dirty liquid. All your scrubbing has probably created little pools of dirty liquid on your tiles. Use a damp cloth to wipe this up, and wring it out into a separate container. This will keep your tiles cleaner in the end.",
                "Complete your grout cleaning. Use the above process to move onto the rest of your grout, giving all it a thorough cleaning. Focus on simply getting the dirt and dark areas out of your grout, exposing the natural white underneath.",
                "Do a final wipe-down. When you are convinced your grout cleaning is finished, do a second clean up of the entire area. If you were working on counters or in a bathroom, use a generic cleaning spray and rag to wipe down your tiles. For floors, go ahead, mop your tiles again, and towel dry.",
                "Clean up your tiles. Before getting down and scrubbing your grout, you need to do a basic once-over with your favorite cleaner. If you cleaning floor grout, sweep and mop. For bathroom and kitchen counter grout, spray, and wipe it down with your favorite cleaner.",
                "Create your paste. In a small bowl, mix hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to form a thick paste. The parts of each may vary depending on the consistency and thickness you prefer to work with.",
                "Spread your mixture. Use your finger or a toothbrush to spread the paste onto your grout. Start in a small area only, no larger than 1-2 square feet. Keep the solution thick and completely the coat the grout. Allow it to set for 5-10 minutes.",
                "Begin scrubbing. Use a small brush such as a toothbrush (electric preferably) for scrubbing at the grout. Apply firm pressure over a small area to lift dirt and stains. If the grout is still dirty, add more of your paste and scrub again after letting it set for a few minutes.",
                "Finish your space. Continue adding the cleaning mixture to the grout and scrubbing it off. Work slowly to ensure that you have gotten all your grout cleaned up.",
                "Wipe up your tile. Use a damp rag to wipe off the remaining paste on your tile. Finish by cleaning your tiles as usual with a spray cleaner for counters or a mop and soap for floors.[1]",
                "Wipe down your tile. Get rid of all surface dirt and crumbs that might make cleaning your grout more tedious by wiping down your tile before getting to the grout cleaning. Follow your regular cleaning regimen by sweeping and mopping floors or using a spray cleaner to wipe down countertops.",
                "Create your solution. Oxygen bleach is a safe bleach compound, which works to dissolve bacteria and grime while whitening grout. Mix equal parts of oxygen bleach with warm water and allow the mixture to dissolve.",
                "Apply your cleaner. Choose your starting area, no larger than 1-2 square feet at a time, and pour on your bleach. Make sure the grout is thoroughly coated with the liquid; you can use a spray bottle if it makes it easier to do so. Leave the solution to work on the grout for 15-20 minutes.",
                "Begin scrubbing. When the bleach has had time to set, you can begin scrubbing at the grout to work out the dirt and stains. Use a small brush, like a toothbrush, to rub the grout. You can add more bleach as you scrub to keep the area moist and expedite the cleaning process.",
                "Mop up the excess liquid. Grab a dry towel and mop up the dirty bleach-water that pools on the tile when you finish scrubbing. If you get enough, wring the towel out between uses. Doing this, will make it easier to finish cleaning in the end.",
                "Continue washing your grout. Repeat the process of applying bleach to the grout and scrubbing it out until you have finished all your tiled area. For particularly tough stains in the grout, you can apply the bleach for an hour or longer. The longer you let it soak, the easier it will be to scrub out the stain.",
                "Finish cleaning your tile. Do a final mop-up of your tile before cleaning it again as you usually would. A final wipe-down will remove any remaining bleach and dirt, and leave your grout shiny and good-as-new.[2]",
                "Clean up spills right away. Letting cranberry juice or orange juice sit on grout for a few hours is a sure way to get a new stain. As soon as something is spilled on your floor, wipe it up with a wet rag, removing every last trace.\n\n\nIf a stain is left behind, pour a bit of hydrogen peroxide over it. Let it sit for a minute before wiping it away with a clean cloth.\nDry spills can also stain grout if they are left to be ground into the floor. Sweep up coffee grounds, clumps of dirt, and other solids soon after they are dropped.",
                "Treat small stains regularly. To avoid having to do a deep cleaning too often, treat small stains as they come. Use the same cleaning solution you would use for a deep cleaning, but employ a spray bottle to treat the small area you want to clean. You could also try an alternative small stain-cleaning methods:\n\n\nUse a baking soda paste. Mix baking soda with a little water to make a paste, and then rub it into the stained section of grout. Let it sit for a few minutes, then use an old toothbrush to scrub it away.\nUse white toothpaste. Squirt some toothpaste directly onto the grout in question, then rub it in using your finger. After a few minutes, use an old toothbrush to scrub the area. Wipe it up with a clean wet rag.\nUse a pencil eraser. For the smallest stains, a pencil eraser does a surprisingly good job. Choose an eraser that is white, rather than stained a different color, or you may end dyeing your grout the color of the eraser.",
                "Keep the area ventilated. Mold and mildew often affect grout in bathrooms, which tend to stay wet and steamy for hours at a time. Use an exhaust fan after taking a shower or bath, and wipe up wet tile to keep your grout from getting moldy.",
                "Apply grout sealer. Once a year, applying a commercial grout sealer can help prevent spills from quickly seeping into the pores in the grout, and it helps with bathroom mold and mildew. Choose a grout sealer from your hardware store and apply it according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
                "Dye it a different color. Sometimes keeping grout white just isn't practical. If you dye your hair, have kids who like to use paints in the kitchen, or just don't want to deal with keeping it sparkling white, consider getting a grout stain and using it to dye the grout a different color. You can choose a color that matches your tile or something completely different for a contrasting effect.",
                "Know when to replace your grout. Older grout starts to crack and crumble, and it gets worse as moisture seeps in and degrades the floor underneath over time. Replacing your grout when necessary is worth the trouble because it makes it easier to clean and prevents mold and mildew from taking hold as often."

        "wikiHow to Calculate Your Golf Handicap": {
            "intro": "The golf handicap was introduced in 1911 to allow golfers of differing abilities to play together in a relatively evenly-matched way. Knowing your Handicap Index will allow you to determine what your Course Handicap should be for the specific golf course on which you’re playing. When you and your golfing partner(s) have determined your specific Course Handicaps, you can then tally your final scores in such a way that you can compare them fairly, even if you play at different skill levels.",
            "steps": [
                "Find your adjusted gross score. To calculate your Handicap Index, you’ll first need a minimum of five golf scores (and no more than 20).\n\n\nGather at least five scores 18-hole scores or ten 9-hole scores and use them to calculate your Adjusted Gross Score.\nTo determine your Adjusted Gross Score (AGS), total up the number of strokes taken during a round, then adjust for the maximum per-hole scores (determined by the USGA’s Equitable Stroke Control guidelines). Most golf courses make the information on maximum per-hole scores available to the general public. Check the course’s website or inquire at the clubhouse.\nFor example, if you took 8 strokes on a hole whose maximum-per hole score is 5, you would count 5 strokes (not 8) for that hole when adding up your total number of strokes for the game.",
                "Calculate your Handicap Differential. Once you have your AGS, use it to determine your handicap differential.\n\n\nThe equation for a Handicap Differential is the Course Rating minus your AGS, multiplied by 113, and divided by the Slope Rating, or (AGS - Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating.\nThe Course Rating is the numerical value given by the UGSA to each set of tees on a course. It approximates the number of strokes it should take a scratch golfer to complete the course. Most courses make this information available via the course website or at the clubhouse.\nThe Slope Rating shows the difficulty of a course for an average golfer and is calculated by comparing the Course Rating to the scores of bogey golfers. Most golf courses make the Slope Rating available to their guests; again, check their website or at the clubhouse.[1]\n\nFor example, say your AGS is 85, the Course Rating is 69.3, and the Slope Rating is 117. You would have the equation (AGS - Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating, or (85 - 69.3) x 113 / 117, which results in a Handicap Differential of 15.2.",
                "Calculate your Handicap Index. The formula for your Handicap Index is the sum of your differentials divided by the number of differentials, multiplied by 0.96, or (Sum of Differentials / Number of Differentials) x 0.96.\n\n\nThe figure of 0.96 in the equation represents the “bonus for excellence” that the UGSA has figured into the Handicap Index.\nDetermine the number of differentials to be used. If you’re using 5-6 scores, use the lowest differential; if you have scores from 7-8 rounds, use the lowest two differentials; if you have scores from 9-10 rounds, use the lowest three differentials; and so on). You can use up to 20 scores (for which you would use the 10 lowest differentials). For more detail on how many differentials to use, see the UGSA Handicap Differentials Chart.\nFor example, if you’re using 8 scores, you’ll be using the lowest two differentials. Let’s say your two lowest differentials are 10 and 11. To average them, add them together, and then divide the resulting number by 2. Then multiply the result by 0.96, and drop any digits beyond the tenths place. The equation would look like this: 10 + 21 = 21; 21 / 2 = 10.5; 20.5 x 0.96 = 10.08. Dropping the digit beyond the tenths place gives you a handicap index of 10.0 (remember not to round up).",
                "Calculate your Handicap Index. If you haven’t already done so, you’ll need to calculate your Handicap Index in order to determine your Course Handicap (see previous section).\n\n\nYour Course Handicap takes into account your ability and the course’s difficulty in order to show you your handicap for that particular course, or, in other words, how many strokes--based on your Handicap Index--you can deduct from your final score for this particular course.",
                "Find the Slope Rating of your course. Most golf courses make this information available to players at the club house.\n\n\nLook for the course’s Slope Rating on the course website or ask an employee at the course’s clubhouse.",
                "Calculate your Course Handicap. Once you have your Handicap Index and the course’s Slope Rating, you can total up your Course Handicap using the formula: (Handicap Index) x (Slope Rating) / 113. Round to the nearest whole number.\n\n\nYou divide by 113 because it represents the Standard Slope Rating established by the UGSA.\nMany courses offer conversion charts that allow you to skip the formula altogether when looking up your Course Handicap. The UGSA also offers a comprehensive listing of Course Handicap conversion charts specific to the course you’ll be playing on.\nFor example, if you have a handicap index of 10.0 and a slope rating of 117, you would use the following equation: (10.0 x 117) / 113, which results in a course handicap of 10.3.",
                "Go to the range. The more practice you have with your strokes, the better your performance on the links will be.\n\n\nMake it a habit to frequent the range regularly and often.\nUse your practice at the range to perfect your stroke, which will translate into better form when it counts.",
                "Check your equipment. Having ill-fitting or over-used equipment can have a noticeably negative impact on your game.\n\n\nCheck that your equipment is still in good working order (no disintegrating grips, no worn-down grooves, etc.). If it isn’t, invest in replacements.\nGet your equipment properly fitted to you. Having equipment properly sized to your body can make a significant difference to the quality of your game.[2]",
                "Challenge yourself. Challenging yourself will help keep your skills sharp and diversified.\n\n\nPlay different courses. Don’t get stuck only playing at your home course--challenge yourself by playing on new and different courses that will help you practice a variety of skills.\nPlay in less-than-ideal conditions. If it’s windy, rainy, or otherwise less-than-ideal outside, don’t stay home--instead, challenge yourself by playing in the more difficult conditions. Doing so will help you develop a broader, more diverse range of skills that you can then use to your advantage when playing in comparatively easier conditions."

        "How to Dye Fabric With Coffee": {
            "intro": "A simple way you can get started with dyeing fabric at home is by using an ingredient you likely already have - coffee. You can dye fabric using coffee with a few simple tools and common ingredients that are most likely already in your cupboard. The best types of fabrics to use are ones made from natural materials, such as cotton, wool, and linen.[1] This process is quick and relatively mess-free, and it will allow you to alter the look of almost any fabric that you want.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash the fabric beforehand. Before dyeing, wash and dry the fabric as you normally would. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the dye from penetrating evenly.\n\n\nNewly purchased fabrics may be coated with a finishing spray, so it is especially important to follow through with this step. The finishing sprays used to coat textiles are often chemicals that are often skin-irritants and they could interfere with how the textile fibers absorb the dye.[2]",
                "Brew coffee. The amount of coffee that you should brew will depend on how dark you would like the fabric to be. Stronger coffee will achieve a darker tint.\n\n\nIf you are looking to create a darker tint with the coffee, use more coffee or use a dark/very strong roast. If you would like a lighter tint, use less coffee or use coffee that is a light or medium roast.\nAs an alternative to preparing several batches of coffee at home, you can use instant coffee or you can purchase brewed coffee from a local store or coffee shop.This could be significantly more expensive, however.",
                "Fill a pot with water. Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high.\n\n\nThe size of the pot will depend on how much fabric you are dyeing. As a rule of thumb, you will need a large enough pot to completely submerge the fabric in water.",
                "Pour brewed coffee into the pot. When the coffee is finished brewing, pour the coffee into the pot with the water.",
                "Bring the mixture to a boil. After pouring all of your prepared coffee into the pot, bring the coffee/water to a boil. Turn off the heat as soon as the coffee reaches a full boil.",
                "Add the fabric to the pot. Once you have turned the heat off and the coffee has stopped bubbling, submerge the fabric entirely into the coffee. Stir it around a bit to make sure any air pockets are eliminated.\n\n\nSince the water just stopped boiling, it may be best to use a wooden spoon, so as not to burn yourself or ruin your utensils.",
                "Steep the fabric. The longer your fabric steeps in the coffee, the deeper it will be dyed. You will need to wait about an hour for appreciable, colorfast results, but you can allow a longer steeping time for a deeper tint.[3]",
                "Remove and rinse the fabric. Remove the fabric from the coffee dye and rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Do this until the water runs clear, which will indicate that all of the excess dye has been removed.\n\n\nAfter rinsing the excess coffee dye, you will be able to accurately tell how dark the fabric has been tinted. If you still want the fabric to be darker after rinsing it, you can steep the fabric again.\nOnce you have achieved the desire tint, prepare a large enough container to hold all of your fabric with cold water and let the fabric soak. You can add vinegar to this cold water bath and let soak for ten minutes to set the dye.[4]",
                "Rinse the pot. When you are finished dyeing the fabric, rinse the pot. The coffee dye may stain the pot if you do not drain and wash it promptly after the dyeing process is complete.",
                "Wash and dry the fabric gently. Use a delicate cycle in the washing machine with cold water and use a mild detergent. You can then dry the fabric on low in the dryer or hang it up in the shade to dry.[5]\n\nThe coffee dye described above will not provide a completely colorfast finish since it is a natural dye, which means that the color will fade a bit with each successive wash.",
                "Wash the fabric beforehand. Before dyeing, wash the fabric but do not dry it. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the rub from penetrating evenly.\n\n\nYou can wash the fabric with the rest of your clothes or just wash it by itself, depending on your preference.\nBe sure to follow the washing instructions of the fabric, if provided.",
                "Brew coffee. You will need the used grounds of the coffee that is brewed. A good method to use for this is to use a French Press or use a coffee maker.\n\n\nYou will need enough coffee grounds to cover the entirety of the fabric that you are dyeing. You may need to brew several pots of coffee for this purpose.\nPick a dark roast to dye the fabric darker and a lighter roast if you do not wish for it to be very dark.\nThis is a great way to make use of your used coffee grounds. If you are a regular coffee drinker, you can save the used coffee grounds for this method.",
                "Create a paste with the used coffee grounds. Once the grounds have cooled, add the coffee grounds to a large bowl and then add water. You will need about a tablespoon of water per cup of grounds.[6]\n\nStir the water into the grounds with a wooden spoon so that the water has evenly penetrated the mix. It does not need to be a fine paste so stirring spoon 7-8 times should be enough.",
                "Spread the paste onto the fabric. Lay the fabric to dry on a water-proof surface. Be sure to cover the fabric completely with the coffee grounds and rub the coffee into the fabric. This can be done with a wooden spoon or similar utensil, or you can use your hands for this part.\n\n\nThis can be messy so you will want to do this somewhere where it is acceptable to make a mess, such as in a garage. You can also lay down plenty of newspaper to protect the floor or carpeting.",
                "Dry the fabric. Hang the fabric up to air dry in a place that is shaded. You will want to wait for the fabric to dry completely. This may take anywhere from several hours to an entire day. You can also dry the fabric in the dryer on low heat for approximately thirty minutes.[7]\n\nDo not let the fabric air dry in the sun because the sun will fade your fabric.[8]",
                "Brush off the coffee grounds. You can brush off the grounds with your hands, shake the grounds off by shaking out the fabric, or use a brush with natural fibers to remove all of the grounds. If the fabric is still not dark enough, repeat the process until it is to your liking.",
                "Press the fabric with an iron if desired. Using an iron will remove wrinkles from the fabric.\n\n\nThe fabric will need to be completely dry for best results with the hot iron.",
                "Wash the fabric beforehand. Before dyeing, wash and dry the fabric as you normally would. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the rub from penetrating evenly.\n\n\nYou can wash the fabric with the rest of your clothes or just wash it by itself, depending on your preference.\nBe sure to follow the washing instructions of the fabric, if provided.",

                "Let the coffee cool. You can put it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes or simply wait for it to cool for a couple of hours at room temperature.",
                "Pour the coffee into the squeeze bottles. This is so you can pour the dye onto the sections without spilling anything into other sections.\n\n\nReserve different squeeze bottles for different types of roasts (i.e. one squeeze bottle with a dark roast, another bottle for a light roast).",
                "Section off areas of the fabric. You can twist the fabric and use the rubber bands to section the areas. This will ensure that you know which sections should be dyed and will also prevent the dye from sinking too far into the fabric.\n\n\nSpread the fabric out completely.\nTake your finger, place it in the middle of the garment, and begin turning your finger and hand clockwise.\nThe fabric will start to bunch up as you twist. Be sure to keep the fabric orderly and create a circular shape, like a very wide and short cylinder, similar to the shape of a pie.\nOnce the fabric is shaped like a pie, rubber band it in sections, as if you are dividing the pie into eighths.",
                "Dye the sectioned areas with the coffee. Use the squeeze bottles to pour the coffee onto the fabric. You may want to use more or darker coffee on certain sections to create a color variance.\n\n\nOnce you have finished dying the top part, flip it over and dye the bottom.",
                "Place the fabric into a sealed container. Depending on the size of the fabric, you can use a plastic container or a ziplock bag. Seal the bag or container and place it somewhere warm for 24 hours.\n\n\nIf you have a lot of fabric, you can use a plastic storage container. They vary in size from a shoebox size to large enough to store kitchen appliances and other large items.",
                "Rinse the fabric. Once the coffee dye and fabric have set, open the ziplock bag or the container and remove the fabric. Rinse well under cold water, until the water runs clear."

                "Stir until all the dry ingredients are blended and the batter has an even consistency. A fork or small whisk will do. Just mix it up until you see no more chunks of flour and cocoa. You want a nice, smooth batter.[3]",
                "Place the mug on a plate in the microwave. Depending on the size of the mug and the strength of the microwave, the brownie may spill over a bit when cooking. Place a plate under the mug to make your life easier during clean-up.",
                "Microwave the brownie for 60 seconds. Some brownies take a little less, some a little more. Start with 1 minute, then check the brownie with a fork to see if it hit your desired consistency. You can then keep cooking and checking in 30-second intervals until you have your perfect brownie.[4]\n\nThe consistency will be slightly molten and gooey, unlike a traditional brownie. Don't worry if it seems a little \"wet,\" this is by design.[5]",
                "Eat the brownie when it is cooked to your liking. There is no reason you couldn't eat the batter raw, other than it wouldn't taste very good. So if you want a gooey, wet brownie, take it out a little early. If you want something firmer and more cake-like, add an extra 20-30 seconds to the timer. You can customize it however you like.",
                "Make things easy on yourself. If you'd rather not make things from scratch and choose to use brownie mix instead, place 1/2 cup of mix to a 1/4 cup of water into the cup and microwave the mix for 1 minute.",
                "Whip in one egg for a richer brownie. Eggs provide a richer, thicker consistency, much more like a traditional brownie. To make sure it is cooked all the way, it is best to beat it before adding to the brownie mixture. Mix it in with the wet ingredients before combining with the dry.[6]\n\nIf you like your brownies moist and gooey, add at least 30 seconds to your planned cooking time to ensure the egg cooks. You just want the finished brownie to be firm.",
                "Substitute brown sugar for granulated sugar to get a moister brownie. This generally keeps the brownie a little wetter. Classic white sugar, however, may make the brownie rise a little higher.[7]",
                "Add a pinch of spice. A little dash of cinnamon goes great with chocolate. You can go even further with a quick dash of nutmeg, allspice, and or ground cloves for a winter spiced brownie. Even pumpkin spice mix can be delicious. You only need, however, a tiny bit of spice -- under a half teaspoon. It will go a long way.",
                "Toss in some chocolate chips before cooking for gooey chocolate chunks. A few well-placed chocolate chips will melt partially while cooking. Use whatever chips you want -- dark, milk, white, etc. -- and simply fold them in after you've stirred up all the other ingredients.",
                "Try out a handful of chopped nuts. You'll only need a 1/4 cup or less. Toss them in after you've mixed up all the other ingredients and give them a quick stir to mix them in.",
                "Add a teaspoon of instant coffee for a Mocha Mug Brownie. Looking for a little kick? A quick dash of instant coffee will add a ton of flavor and touch of caffeine to get you going.[8]\n\nLooking for even more coffee flavor? Use pre-brewed coffee instead of water in the batter.[9]"

        "How to Shoot a Handgun": {
            "intro": "Despite what Hollywood would have you believe, shooting a handgun with precision requires balance, technique, and practice. Even if you're an experienced shooter of long guns, shooting a handgun accurately requires a different set of skills. Read on for a basic primer on handgun safety and accuracy.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn the difference between a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol. These are the two basic types of handguns. The handguns you would see in a cowboy movie are revolvers. The cartridges in a revolver are loaded into a cylinder in the middle of the frame of the gun. A capacity of six is most common but some hold five and are designed to fit smaller hands. A semi-automatic pistol has a sliding mechanism at the top of the handgun and a magazine of pre-loaded ammunition in the handle. Operation of each type of handgun differ slightly so it's important to clearly define terms before handling a gun.\n\n\nRevolvers have a revolving cylinder for holding the ammunition. The ammunition is loaded into the cylinder, then the cylinder swings into the revolver and it is ready to fire. After a bullet is fired, the cylinder rotates and lines up the next cartridge in line with the firing pin. Most revolvers can be fired in a double action mode which is pulling the trigger which rotates the hammer until it falls and fires the cartridge. Additionally, the hammer can be pulled back into position before the trigger is pulled, this results in a much lighter trigger pull and improves accuracy. In order to retrieve the spent cartridges, the cylinder is rotated outwards allowing the empty ammunitions to be removed.\nA semi-automatic pistol advances each cartridge into the chamber from the magazine. It then ejects the empty cartridge after it has been fired. The slide on the top of the gun is used to advance the first shell into the chamber, and can be locked in the back position with a button or pin on the side. The removable magazine is removed and loaded separately.",
                "Choose the right handgun and ammunition for your needs. Handguns come in many varieties with a seemingly endless array of ammunition options. Also, consider your body, hand size and purpose of your handgun.\n\n\nYou probably don't need a .357 Magnum to try out target shooting at the gun range. Avoid buying an overly large high-caliber gun if you're interested in getting started, and instead get a small-caliber reliable gun, like a .22. Talk to dealers and others experienced with firearms for recommendations.",
                "Protect your ears and eyes with proper safety gear. Headphone-style ear protection and earplugs will protect against the noise of the gunshots. Safety goggles will protect the eyes from flying shells, hot gasses and lead particles that are ejected from a semi-automatic handgun.\n\n\nWear safety goggles even if you already wear glasses. Safety goggles are designed to protect you in a way your glasses won't.",
                "Always handle a handgun safely. When handling a handgun, always keep it pointed downrange. Do not use a gun range unless there is an appropriate backdrop and safety equipment.\n\n\nBe careful of all safety consideration while at the range. It is not only important to practice good gun safety, you must be aware of what those around you are doing. Many beginners struggle pulling the slide back with a semi-automatic with just their thumb and forefinger, especially if the handgun has a strong spring or your hands are sweaty. If you need to use the palm of your hand (or your whole hand) to pull back the slide, turn your body sideways to the weapon and keep it pointed downrange.",
                "ALWAYS check first to see if the handgun is loaded. ANY time you pick up a handgun you need to check to see if it is loaded. Even when you first bring it home from the store, check to see if it is loaded. If you got it out of the closet for the first time in ten years, check to see if it is loaded. If you just unloaded it, check to see if it is loaded. And, always check any gun that is given to you by anybody at anytime. Failure to do this can result in serious damage to property, injury to people and death!\n\n\nWith a revolver, release the cylinder and rotate it to the side. All the chambers should be empty. In a semi-automatic pistol, remove the magazine from the gun and pull the slide back to look into the chamber to make sure there isn't a cartridge in the firing chamber. If there is, racking the slide should eject it.\nKeep the slide in the back position while you practice holding the gun to be sure it's unloaded and to get used to keeping your thumb out of the way of the slide's action.",
                "Carefully pick up your gun, keeping your finger outside the trigger guard, extended straight and flat on the side of the guard. Whenever you handle it, make sure the barrel is pointed downrange, which should be clear of people. Outdoors, always keep your handgun pointed downwards, never up. A bullet fired up by accident will come down and may injure someone.\n\n\nNEVER point any gun at anyone even if it is unloaded, and even as a joke. Pointing a gun at someone is a crime in some states and the stupidest thing you can ever do. There will be times you believe it to be unloaded when it is. Practice holding the gun at the range with the gun unloaded.",
                "Hold your weapon in the firing-ready position.[1] Open your dominant hand (the hand you write with) to expose the webbing between your index finger and thumb. Taking the pistol in your other hand, insert the grip (handle) of the pistol into the web of your dominant hand. With your thumb on one side of the grip, keep your middle, ring, and pinky fingers curled securely around the other side just below the trigger guard.\n\n\nYou are really gripping the gun only with the middle and ring fingers, the \"pinky\" is resting on the gun but is not used to grip; neither is the thumb used to grip the gun. The grip should be firm but not tight. If you're gripping it so tightly that the gun shakes, you will not be able to accurate control it.",
                "Steady the gun with your other hand. Your non dominant hand should be held underneath the handgun providing support for the weight of the gun. Place your index finger on the bottom of the trigger guard or in front of it, wherever is most comfortable.",
                "Make sure all fingers are clear of the slide or hammer. Some older semi automatics have a habit of 'biting' the web between your index finger and thumb. Getting \"bitten\" by the slide can be very painful as well as dangerous, because you don't want to react to pain and risk dropping a loaded and cocked gun with the safety off.",
                "Stand in the proper firing stance. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with the foot opposite your dominant hand about a step past the other foot. Lean forward slightly with your knees bent, making sure you’re firmly balanced. The elbow of your dominant arm should be almost straight and your non-dominant elbow should be flexed at a slightly obtuse angle. Your dominant arm must be in line with the handgun and pointed at the target.\n\n\nSome shooting matches are done one-handed (off hand). In those events, the stance is more \"open\" with the gun arm and the body in almost a straight line to as much as about 90-degrees, the dominant foot toward the target. A firm grip on the gun is more important since you are not using the other hand for support.\nNever aim the gun sideways or with a bent wrist like in the movies. This is extremely dangerous and unsteady!",
                "Align the front sight with the rear sight. Ensure that the top of the front sight post is level with the top of the rear sight, and that the rear sight appears evenly centered within the notch of the front sight. This will ensure that the gun is level and that you'll get a good \"sight picture\" when aiming at the target.\n\n\nIt is most common to aim by using your dominant eye and closing the other. For other events where depth perception is important, practice aiming with both eyes open. You will need to learn to ignore the picture from you non dominant eye while still seeing the depth.",
                "Develop your sight picture. When shooting, a common confusion is where to focus.[2]On the target? On the sight? On the target? After leveling the handgun and ensuring your firearm is aimed correctly you will need to focus on the target or placing your shot accurately is impossible.",
                "Fix the gun on the target. You should see the sharply focused front sight touching the bottom of the blurry, unfocused bulls-eye. Now you place your trigger finger on the trigger.",
                "Load the gun. When you're ready to shoot and you've practiced aiming and steadying the gun and developing a good sight picture, load the gun. Keep the safety on when loading the gun (if your gun has one) and remove it when you're in the firing position with your gun pointed at the target. Keep the barrel of the gun pointed downrange the entire time you load the gun! Most shooting accidents happen during loading and unloading a handgun.\n\n\nIf the pistol is a semi-automatic, you'll need to load a round into the chamber by pulling back the slide and releasing it.",
                "Control your breathing. Shortly before firing the handgun, after you have carefully aimed it, you will need to take a deep breath and hold it. Calm your body. Looking at how the sights will be moving, you will notice that it traces a small figure eight pattern. This is due to the beating of your heart. In order to ensure you can see your aim point, pull the trigger when the sights come to the bottom of the figure eight. By the time you are finished pulling the trigger, the sights should be at the aim point. From the time you hold your breath to the time you pull the trigger should be short but not rapid or hurried.",
                "Pull the trigger. Every firearm has a different trigger pull - the amount of pressure required for it to fire. Before you load the handgun, it's a good idea to \"dry fire\" the handgun, (point the gun down range and pull the trigger while the gun is unloaded). This will help you learn what point in the trigger pull the gun will fire. When you are ready to fire, pull the trigger slowly in one smooth, controlled motion. A common reason for inaccurate shots is trying to anticipate the recoil (jerking the gun right as you think it's going to fire). It may seem counter-intuitive, but for the most accurate shots, try to let the recoil \"surprise you\" rather than predicting when it will happen.",
                "Follow through. Every sport has \"follow-through\" and target shooting is no exception. As you squeeze the trigger the gun will fire, but don't release the trigger suddenly or relax your posture, your stance or your arms. Be still. Release the trigger after you've taken a breath and prepare for the next shot.\n\n\nFollow-through action improves accuracy and reduces shot variation, just as follow-through does for a golfer or a tennis player.",
                "Practice firing several rounds. Take your time between rounds. There is no hurry.It is better to get a few accurate hits than to get many bad shots. You are at the range to get better, not turn money into noise.",
                "Unload your weapon and recheck it to ensure it is unloaded. With the gun still in firing position, click the safety back in place (if your handgun has one) and remember to keep the gun pointed downrange while you unload it. For revolvers, check the cylinder to ensure there are no rounds in it or remove any that are. Release the magazine from a semi-automatic pistol and rack the slide to eject any shells that may be in the chamber."

        "How to Clean Wine Glasses": {
            "intro": "Wine glasses are beautiful, and often very delicate. If your wine glasses are made out of crystal, they cannot be washed in the dishwasher like ordinary glasses, and will require extra special care. This article will show you a few different ways of cleaning wine glasses, as well as how to remove stubborn stains.",
            "steps": [
                "Hold the glass carefully by the bowl and not by the stem. The stem is fragile, and the glass can break easily if you hold it by that. Instead, cup your hand around the bottom of the bowl, with your fingers to either side of the steam.\n\n\nThis method will also work for regular wine glasses.\nIf you are cleaning painted or glittered wine glasses, use this method.",
                "Rinse the glasses in lukewarm to hot water. If the water is too hot for you, it is likely too hot for the wine glass; water can cause glass to crack if it is hot enough. Sometimes, this is all that is needed to clean the glass.",
                "Wipe the glass clean with a long-handled sponge. Avoid sticking your hand into the glass itself, or you will risk breaking the glass. Instead, find a soft sponge attached to a long, plastic handle. Focus your cleaning on the places that get the most dirty, such as the rim, the bottom of the glass, and the outside of the bowl.\n\n\nDo not use steal wool or a scouring pad.[1] Also, avoid using anything with stiff, plastic bristles. All of these can scratch the surface.",
                "Use a mild, odorless dish soap if needed. Usually, a simple rinse and light buffing with a soft sponge is all that is needed. If the wine glass is especially dirty, however, you might need to use a mild dish soap. You will not need a lot; a small drop will be enough.\n\n\nTry to use a low-alkaline detergent, if possible.[2]",
                "Rinse each glass well, inside and out, with hot water. Be sure to get rid of any soap residue. Crystal absorbs odors and flavors easily. If you don't rinse the wine glass well enough, your next glass of wine might have a slight soapy flavor.",
                "Place the wine glass upside down on a soft towel so that it can air dry. The soft cloth will help protect the rim from the hard surface of your counter or table.",
                "Dry the glasses with a soft, lint-free towel if you live in an area that has hard water. This will help prevent any hard water stains. Use a soft, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.",
                "Know that some stains may be permanent. Crystal is a very porous material. It absorbs flavors and is easily damaged. If the crystal wine glasses have turned foggy because they were cleaned in the dishwasher at some point in time, the damage is permanent. The heat of the dishwasher would have baked the detergent into the glass.",
                "Choose short-stemmed wine glasses made out of glass. Do not use this method for crystal wine glasses, or for wine glasses with long, delicate stems. Also, do not use this method for painted or glittered wine glasses.",
                "Plan on washing the glasses separate from the rest of your dishes. Do not load them in with anything that is very dirty or greasy. The grease can get on the glasses and smear them.[3]",
                "Place the glasses upside down on the top rack, and space them so that they are not touching. Try to have about a hands width between each glass. This will lessen the chances of the glasses bumping against each other and chipping.",
                "Use a small amount of odorless detergent. The less detergent you use, the better. Also, try to use a mild, low-alkaline detergent. Do not add any rinse-aid. Rinse-aid may help prevent water stains, but it will also leave behind a chemical residue that will affect the flavor of your next glass of wine.[4]\n\nIf the wine glasses are stained, consider adding half a wine glass of white vinegar into the wash cycle.[5]",
                "Use a short, gentle cycle. If you can, try to use a lower water temperature setting as well. The higher the water temperature, the more likely your wine glasses will be to crack.",

The soft cloth is important, as it will help protect the wine glass from getting scratched.\n\n\nThis method is great for glasses that have turned foggy. It is also good for tough wine stains.\nDo not use this one painted or glittered wine glasses. Soaking these glasses in water for long periods of time can cause the paint or glitter to flake off.",

Make sure that the washing soda or baking soda are completely dissolved; any remaining specks may scratch the glass.[8]\n\nWashing soda will help remove cloudiness, but it may not remove wine stains. Baking soda will work the same way, just not as well.",
                "Lay the wine glass down in the container. The wine glass should be completely submerged. If it isn't, add some more warm water.",
                "Wait one to two hours before removing the wine glass.[9] This will give the acids in the vinegar enough time to dissolve the stains.",
                "Rinse the glass using fresh water. Hold the glass by the bowl. Do not hold it by the stem, especially if it is a crystal wine glass. The stem is very fragile, and may break. If the wine glass is still foggy, it is possible that the damage is permanent. Wine glasses, especially those made from crystal, often turn foggy if they are washed in the dishwasher.[10]",
                "Set the wine glass upside down on a soft, lint-free cloth to air dry. Spread the cloth over your table or counter. Set the wine glass upside down on it. If you live in an area that has hard water, you might want to dry the glass off by hand using a soft, lint-free cloth instead."

                "Choose a ukulele. There are several different sizes and corresponding sounds of ukuleles, and it is important to select the best option for you. As a beginner you will most likely want to choose a cheaper option rather than investing in an expensive ukulele, but this may not be the case. There are four different styles of ukuleles.\n\n\nA soprano ukulele is the most common style. It is recognized by its small size and classic “uke” sound. This is the cheapest style of ukulele, and is most often chosen by beginners. It is on average 21” long, and has anywhere from 12-14 frets.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 1Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet1.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe alto ukulele (or concert ukulele), is the next size up from a soprano. It measures 23” long and has 15-20 frets. Because of its slightly bigger size, people with large hands find it easier to play than a soprano ukulele. It also has a slightly fuller sound than a soprano.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 1Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1a/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet2.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe next step up from an alto ukulele is the tenor ukulele. The tenor ukulele is 26” long and has 15+ frets. It has an even richer sound than the concert ukulele, and has the ability to reach more notes because of its extended fretboard.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 1Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet3.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe largest ukulele is the baritone ukulele, which is 30” or more and has 19+ frets. It is tuned the same way as the four lowest strings on a guitar, which makes the two instruments very similar. Because of its size, it loses the classic ukulele sound, but is a good option if you want really full, rich music.[1]\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 1Bullet4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet4.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-1Bullet4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nSome ukuleles are a different shape, namely flukes, pineapples or fleas. A fluke is shaped like a triangle, a pineapple is shaped like, well a pineapple (oval shape), and a flea is shaped like a pineapple ukulele with a flat bottom. The one pictured in the illustration is a pineapple.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Pineapple ukulele.png\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Pineapple-ukulele.png/728px-Pineapple-ukulele.png\" width=\"728\" height=\"547\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Know the parts of the ukulele. The ukulele has an anatomy of parts slightly different than a guitar or other stringed instrument. Before you begin playing it, make sure you understand the basic layout of the instrument.\n\n\nThe body of the uke is the hollow wooden part that makes up the majority of the instrument. It has a small hole under the strings that you strum above.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 2Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/80/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe neck of the uke is the long wooden piece that the strings sit above. The neck refers to the slightly rounded bottom part, while the flat top part of the neck is called the fingerboard or fretboard.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 2Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet2.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe frets are sections of the fingerboard divided by metal fret dividers. Each fret divides the strings into different notes.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 2Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet3.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe head of the ukulele is the topmost part of the uke where the tuners are located.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 2Bullet4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet4.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThere are four strings on a ukulele, although depending on the type of uke you buy they may be different. The lowest or thickest string is known as the 1st string, moving upwards to the highest or thinnest string which is the 4th string.[2]\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 2Bullet5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet5.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-2Bullet5.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Tune your ukulele. Before you start playing, it is imperative that you tune your instrument. This will give the strings the correct sound, and lessen the discouragement you would have thinking you were playing poorly when your uke was simply out of tune. To tune the uke, you twist the tuner knobs at the top of the head to tighten and loosen the strings.\n\n\nOver time, the tension in the string reduces - they get looser - which puts them out of tune. That means you will have to tighten the strings more often than you will have to loosen them.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 3Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet1.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nIf you are facing the uke, the top left tuner is ‘C,’ the bottom left tuner is ‘G,’ the top right tuner is ‘E,’ and the bottom right tuner controls ‘A’. Adjusting these will change the corresponding string’s sound.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 3Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet2.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nUse an electric tuner or an online tuner to hear the sound each string should make when plucked. Then, alter the sound of yours until it matches.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 3Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9b/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet3.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nIf you have a piano or keyboard available, you can play the key that corresponds to the string you are tuning and match those sounds.[3]\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 3Bullet4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3b/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet4.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Get the correct posture. If you don’t hold your ukulele the right way when you are playing it, you won’t sound as good, you will be uncomfortable, and you run the risk of injuring your wrists over time. Make sure that you are always in the proper position with good posture before beginning to play your ukulele.\n\n\nRegardless of whether you are sitting or standing, you will hold your ukulele in the same fashion.\nThe ukulele should be slightly pushed between your right forearm and your body, and simultaneously resting in the crook of your elbow. If you are holding it correctly, you can remove either of your hands without the uke shifting position. This also means that the uke is held relatively high on your body, near your waist or chest.\nThe neck of the uke should be resting on the thumb and web of your left hand, allowing you to reach around with your other four fingers to touch all the strings.\nWhen you strum with your right hand, use the back of your nails going down the strings and the fleshy part of your fingertips coming back up.\nStrum a little higher on the body of the uke than the hollow hole in the center. Although that is the correct position to play the strings on a guitar, for a uke it is the proper position to play nearer to the neck.\nKeep you back and shoulders straight so that you aren’t hunched over the ukulele. This will improve your appearance when playing and reduce the amount of pain and tension in your back.[4]",
                "Learn some basic chords. Chords are when you play more than one note at once, creating a harmonic sound. To play a chord, you use your left hand to hold down strings at different frets simultaneously. Learning to play chords is easy; you will be supplied with the string number, fret number, and the specific finger required to recreate each sound.",
                "Learn basic major chords. Major chords are formed by three or notes played simultaneously, with the distance between the first and second notes being two whole steps apart. Major chords are associated with cheery or happy music.[5]\n\nTo play a C Major chord, place your ring finger on the 4th string on the third fret.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Play the Ukulele Step 6Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Play-the-Ukulele-Step-6Bullet1.jpg/aid830109-v4-728px-Play-the-Ukulele-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nTo play an F Major chord, put your index finger on the 2nd string of the first fret, and your ring finger on the first string of the second fret.\nTo play a G Major chord, place your index finger on the 3rd string of the second fret, your middle finger on the 4th string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 2nd string of the third fret.\nTo play an A Major chord, put your index finger on the 3rd string of the first fret, and your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret.\nTo play a D Major chord, place your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, your ring finger on the 2nd string of the second fret, and your pinky finger on the 3rd string of the second fret.\nTo play an E Major chord, put your index finger on the 4th string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your pinky finger on the 3rd string of the fourth fret.",
                "Learn the basic minor chords. Minor chords are three or more concurrently played notes, with the distance from the first and second notes being three half-steps. Minor chords are considered sad or gloomy sounding compared to major chords.\n\n\nTo play an A Minor chord, place your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret.\nTo play an E Minor chord, put your index finger on the 4th string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 3rd string of the fourth fret.\nTo play a D Minor chord, place your index finger on the 2nd string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 3rd string of the second fret.\nTo play an F# or Gb Minor chord, put your index finger on the 3rd string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 2nd string of the second fret.\nTo play a B Minor chord, bar the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings with your index finger by holding them all down simultaneously on the second fret, and hold the 1st string down on the fourth fret with your ring finger.[6]",
                "Practice your timing. Once you’ve learned some basic notes and chords, putting them together may seem simple but requires a little timing. In order for your music to sound cohesive and melodic, it is important that you have good rhythm.\n\n\nKeeping a rhythm to your strumming pattern will be difficult at first while you learn how to adjust your left hand quickly between notes and chords. As you get better, try to avoid taking breaks between finger adjustments to improve your timing.\nTry counting in fours while you are playing to help keep a beat while you strum.\nIf you have a difficult time strumming in time, try using a metronome. This is a small electronic gadget that sounds off little clicks at a steady rate, allowing you to pace your strumming to match. You can adjust the speed that it plays to meet your comfort level.\nDon’t try to play super fast at first, as you will be likely to make more mistakes. Start out with a slow, steady rhythm and then work your way towards a more fast-pace beat.",
                "Learn whole songs. Once you have mastered all the basic major and minor chords, you can play nearly any beginner’s song. Using your now rhythmic strumming and fingering you will be able to play recognizable songs in no time.\n\n\nMany ukulele music books provide popular tunes that are easy for beginners to learn. Pick one up at a local music supply store and start playing!\nIf you want to learn some of your favorite songs, search online for the song’s uke tabs. Tabs are like the music for the ukulele, telling you the differing chords and fingering positions that are required.",
                "Practice daily. The most important thing you can do to improve your overall playing ability is to practice on a regular basis. You don’t have to have an inborn talent for music to become a fantastic uke player, but rather just need perseverance and diligence. Putting at least 20-30 minutes of practice a day will help you to become the master instrumentalist you always wanted to be!"

            "intro": "What is the Atkins Advantage 12-week program?",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare for the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet will require major lifestyle changes for most people. Try to make the transition as easy as possible.\n\n\nSet a healthy weight goal and acquire the right equipment.\nUse tools like a food journal and a carbohydrate counting guide.\nTalk to your doctor before starting the Atkins diet.",
                "Understand the diet. The Atkins diet can be simple, however, it is unique. Learning about each phase of the diet will help you understand what to expect. This is the basic overview of the four phases:\n\n\nInduction. Elimination of carbs and the start of the diet. Realize that this will be the hardest part of the diet. This is where carbohydrate withdrawals can and will happen. Pay attention to your body and remember that these symptoms will pass.\nOngoing Weight Loss (OWL). Slow introduction of carbs while still losing weight.\nPre-Maintenance. Weight loss is slowed and you prepare to sustain the diet.\nMaintenance. After you have met your final goal, keep the weight off.",
                "Learn about the benefits and risks. Like any diet, the Atkins diet can beneficial to your health. However, it may also have some risks associated with its methods. Review the following list of benefits and Risks:[1]\n\nBenefits\n\nWeight loss\nImproved cardiovascular health\nImproved cholesterol\n\n\nRisks\n\nHeadache\nDizziness\nWeakness\nFatigue\nConstipation\nPains or weakness in the calves and legs, especially when you lay down to sleep at night\n\n\nThese look serious but they're mainly due to carbohydrate depletion and lack of fiber. The body will maintain balance shortly. In the interim, try a fiber supplement to alleviate constipation and a B12 vitamin supplement for fatigue.",
                "Count carbs on the Atkins diet. Atkins focuses not on total daily carbohydrates but on daily net carbohydrates.Learn how to count net carbs by subtracting dietary fiber and sugar alcohols from the total carbohydrate count.[2]\n\nFind the number of total carbohydrates in a food on the food’s nutrition label.\nFind the quantity of dietary fiber in the food\nSubtract the amount of dietary fiber from the amount of total carbohydrates.\nLook for sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols do not count against your net carb total.\nUse a carbohydrate-counting guide for further help.",
                "Pick Atkins diet products and approved foods. Atkins International produces a variety of low-carb shakes and protein bars. Learn how to read the labels to determine the right products. Try some of the following foods that are approved by the Atkins diet.[3]\n\nVegetables low in carbohydrates - these are the foundation of the Atkins diet\nAll fish.\nAll fowl.\nMeat and Eggs\nFats and Oils",
                "Understand what the Induction phase entails. The Induction phase is designed to kick-start the Atkins diet by putting the body into a state of ketosis, which metabolizes stored fat. Some people lose as much as 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in 2 weeks, but only if they have an extreme amount of weight to lose, usually 100 pounds or more. It is normal to lose 4 to 6 pounds on Induction.[4][5]\n\nKetosis occurs when your body has no sugar based energy and uses fat instead.\nKetosis has some side effects such as nausea, headache, mental fatigue and bad breath. Not everyone enters Ketosis.\nIt is not uncommon to get sick during any dietary changes, especially if you have been eating unhealthy foods for some time. Remember to hydrate your body, take your vitamins and get adequate sleep.",
                "Focus on eating healthy carbs from vegetables as well as fat and protein during this phase. After removing unhealthy carbs, replace them with vegetables and some proteins and fats. Atkins is diet based on VEGETABLES, unlike any other diet out there. Eating more healthy carbs from vegetables will bring nutrition to your body and still let you lose weight. Try to eat the following foods to obtain these fats and proteins:[6]\n\nYou can eat chicken, red meat, fish and eggs, including egg yolks.\nAim for at least 4 ounces (113 g) of protein at each meal.\nYou may enjoy fats including olive oil and mayonnaise during this phase.\nConsume more mono and polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats and trans fats.\nAvoid processed meats, as they may be cured with sugar and count as carbs.",
                "Limit carbohydrates. The main focus of Atkins is to eat healthy carbs from vegetables. Strive to get 12-15 grams of healthy carbs from vegetables like leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower, and others listed on the Atkins Phase 1 (Induction) List here: https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works/atkins-20/phase-1/low-carb-foods. Keep the amount of other carbohydrates that you eat every day as low as possible. This will help you to lose weight at this stage of the diet.[7]\n\nConsume 20 grams of carbohydrates or fewer during this phase. 12-15 grams should come from healthy vegetables. Remember, Atkins is a VEGETABLE-based diet. No other diet puts such an important emphasis on healthy veggies!\nAvoid fruits and grains such as bread and pasta during Induction.\nMake sure that 12 to 15 grams of your daily carbohydrates come from foundation vegetables.[8]\n\nFoundation vegetables are vegetables with next to no carbohydrates. Examples include pickles, spinach, broccoli, sauerkraut, avocado, Daikon radish, red or white onion, and zucchini.",
                "Eat often. Eat at least once every 2-3 hours when you are awake. You can choose to eat five to six smaller meals to jump-start your metabolism. Eating only 3 times per day will not yield as good results for most people, though it will still work.[9]\n\nWhen you do eat, make sure to only eat until you feel full.\nDo not overindulge.",
                "Snack during the Induction phase of Atkins. Eat at least one mid-morning and one mid-afternoon snack to help conquer cravings and to help maintain energy levels. Keeping energy levels up is important.[10][11]\n\nChoose snacks that are high in fat and protein. Fat and protein help to maintain blood sugar and extend satiety. This is critical during any weight loss program, but especially in one where carbohydrates are limited.\nMake sure your snacks have minimal carbohydrates.\nDon't be afraid to make changes to how you were snacking before.\nTry snacks such as vegetables with hummus, a deviled egg, or even beef jerky.",
                "Monitor water intake. Drink 64 fluid ounces (1.9 L) of water daily during your low-carbohydrate diet. In addition, drink 2 cups of broth or eat 2 tablespoons of soy sauce to help your body retain sodium and potassium.[12]",
                "Survive the first ten days of an Atkins diet. Surviving the big changes of the first days of Atkins may require support. Preparation for certain physical challenges, like lagging energy and dizziness, is also important.[13]\n\nWatch your food budget to accommodate for more vegetables, protein, and other whole foods.\nKeep your meals interesting by trying new foods that fit with the Atkins diet.",
                "Avoid the pit-falls of the Atkins diet. Certain uncomfortable physiological symptoms and potential nutritional deficiencies can be avoided by taking a few precautionary measures while you’re on the Atkins diet.[14]\n\nAvoid staying on Induction for more than 2-4 weeks. Some people try to stay on Induction for months or even a year or more, and this is VERY unhealthy for your body. In fact, it is NOT recommended by Atkins nor anyone at Atkins. If you are on Induction for longer than a month, you are no longer doing Atkins. Atkins insists on moving forward and adding more healthy carbs back to your diet.\nDrink plenty of water.\nTake supplements such as vitamins and minerals.\nGet plenty of rest.\nEat plenty of fiber",
                "Determine whether you’re ready to move on to the next phase. Monitor your weight and pay attention to exactly how much you have lost. Weight loss is NEVER the only gauge and tell if you it's time to move on to the next Phase of the Atkins diet. Remember to take measurements, check how your clothes fit, and if you have been on Induction for a month, move on to the next Phase. [15]\n\nThere is NO minimum weight loss to reach before moving on to step 2.\nStay in Phase 1 for NO MORE than 4 weeks.\nYou should NEVER stay on Inductions for 6 months or more. That is NOT Atkins. Anyone who states that you \"should\" lose a certain amount of weight like 15 pounds or that you should stay on Induction for 6 months or a year is NOT doing Atkins. They are advocating a dangerous and unhealthy diet. Please consult Colette Heimowitz, the nutritional expert at Atkins for more information.",
                "Understand Phase 2. You should continue to lose weight during Phase 2, but the weight loss may occur at a slower pace than it did during Phase 1. During Phase 2, add 5 grams to your daily carbohydrate total each week as long as you continue to lose weight.[16]",
                "Begin to add foods back into your diet. The critical rule is to not exceed your maximum number of allowed daily carbohydrates. You can add the following foods at this point:\n\n\nNuts\nFruits\nSoft cheeses",
                "Add more carbohydrates. Boost the quantity of carbohydrates that you eat based on your body’s reaction. If you stop losing weight after eating 30 grams of carbohydrates daily, then you should scale back to 25 grams. You may, however, eat as much as 50 grams as long as you continue to lose weight.[17]\n\nAdjust your carbohydrate intake according to weight loss or gain.\nIf weight gain occurs, lower the level of carbohydrate intake.",
                "Combat constipation on Atkins. Diets low in carbohydrates tend to be low in fiber, which will contribute to constipation. However, you can combat these symptoms by taking the following actions:[18]\n\nDrinking plenty of water.\nEating foods containing healthy carbs and fiber, like vegetables.\nTake a fiber supplement or a probiotic.\nWhile Atkins does not require you to exercise, it does encourage it as you will not only have more regular bowel movements if you do engage in regular exercise, but there are tons of other healthy benefits of exercising. Exercising and lifting weights will also help you avoid baggy skin or other issues that can occur if you have a lot of weight to lose.",
                "Stick to the Atkins diet. You may encounter weight loss plateaus. Feeling like you are getting stuck on one of these plateaus can be demoralizing. However, most people define a \"plateau\" as not seeing the scale move for 2 or 3 days. An actual plateau means there is no loss in weight or inches for at least 2 weeks. You can encourage yourself through these tough moments by taking the following actions.\n\n\nYou can focus on the other benefits of the diet, such as lost inches and added energy.\nCompare your blood tests from now to before you started Atkins. You should notice a positive change in your good cholesterol and a drop in your triglycerides.\nIt is important to note that plateaus are not always a bad thing. Plateaus can sometimes be the body's way of adjusting to the new body weight and creating a new 'normal.' Embrace plateaus!",
                "Balance sugar on the Atkins diet. Calorie-free sugar substitutes can do wonders for baked goods and for beverages.[19]\n\nWatch for hidden sugars by reading labels on your food.\nBe careful with labels such as \"No sugar added\". This does not mean \"No Sugar\"\nTry using sugar replacements such as Stevia or Splenda (in small amounts).",
                "Fight carbohydrate cravings on Atkins. Sometimes, cravings for carbohydrates are actually thirst in disguise. At other times, you may simply be craving the experience of eating or the habit of eating more than you are actually craving food. Learning to recognize your true hunger signals and how to strategically handle cravings will ensure that you are successful while following the Atkins diet.\n\n\nPay attention to your body's signals to see if you are actually experiencing hunger.\nPlan your meals ahead of time if possible and eat every 2-3 hours. This should stave off severe hunger. As your metabolism speeds up and you become used to eating throughout the day, you may find yourself beginning to get hungry every 2-3 hours. This is natural. Just eat your healthy snack or meal and enjoy!",
                "Order Atkins-friendly meals at restaurants. You can still enjoy eating out even when you are on the Atkins diet. Most restaurants serve low-carb options and are willing to accommodate special requests. Atkins is one of the EASIEST diets to maintain when eating out. [20]\n\nAlways order a salad or extra portions of vegetables at your meal. Restaurants will often replace the side carbohydrate (baked potato or rice) with a double portion of veggies.\nSkip the bread basket. If the waiter brings one, just ask that it be removed from the table.\nBe aware of what you are ordering, avoid any items high in carbohydrates.\nIf you aren't sure about an item, ask for more information.",
                "Balance vitamins and minerals on the Atkins diet. One of the main concerns of following a low-carb diet is that the lack of certain vegetables and fruits, particularly during Induction, can cause you to be deficient in vitamins. Also, low-carb diets tend to cause your body to shed sodium and potassium. Avoid these side-effects by taking the following actions: [21]\n\nEat a large variety of foods and take supplements.\nTaking sodium in the form of broth, soy sauce or salt will also keep your kidneys healthy.",
                "Know when to start Phase 3. Phase 3 should begin when you are about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) from your goal weight. You will start adding carbohydrates back to your diet until your weight loss slows to a crawl.[22]",
                "Add more carbohydrates to your diet. Eat an additional 10 grams of daily carbohydrates per week. Watch the scale and pay attention to your cravings so that you know when you are eating too many carbohydrates.[23]\n\nWeight gain indicates too many carbohydrates are being consumed.\nWeight loss should slow greatly during this stage, but still be at a loss.",
                "Add foods one at a time. If certain foods make you start to gain weight, then you will have to eliminate the foods from your diet. Watch the scale carefully for any fluctuation.[24]\n\nDuring diets such as these, you've unintentionally created an elimination diet-type environment for your body. This is a good thing! This means that your body has been rid of the foods/substances that had been plaguing it before. So, when adding foods back in, do them one at a time so you know how each food impacts your body.",
                "Eat a wider variety of carbohydrates. In Pre-Maintenance, you can add starchy vegetables, such as sweet potatoes and winter squash, and whole grains like oatmeal back into your diet. Again, keep a close eye on your weight as you add more variety of carbohydrates.[25]",
                "Understand phase 4. During Phase 4, you will discover your Atkins carbohydrate equilibrium so that you can maintain a healthy weight throughout your life. Balance and careful attention to your carbohydrate levels are key in this stage, as well as paying special attention to how different foods affect your health and overall well-being. [26]",
                "Focus on Maintenance as you begin Phase 4. You do not \"stop\" the Atkins diet - it is a healthy plan that can be continued life-long. Continue to eat plenty of vegetables as well as fat and protein during the Maintenance phase of the low-carb diet even as you add more carbohydrates back to your diet.At this stage of the diet, Atkins is extremely similar to what is known as Clean Eating, a diet that has been used by body-builders and health and fitness proponents for decades. It is a very healthy lifestyle.",
                "Adjust the amount of carbohydrates that you eat. You can add carbs to your diet as long as you don’t deviate from your goal weight. This helps you find your equilibrium number.[27]\n\nIf you notice weight gain, scale back the amount of carbohydrates you are consuming.",
                "Give yourself more space in your diet. You can enjoy the occasional slice of pizza or chocolate cake during Maintenance. Make sure the splurge happens only occasionally and you aren’t tempted to continually overindulge.[28]\n\nOverindulging will undo all of your hard work.",
                "Monitor your weight. If you gain or lose more than 5 pounds (2.27 kg), then you need to lower or increase your carbohydrate intake to compensate.\n\n\nPay careful attention to your weight and the connection to the foods you are eating. Over time you will have a clear understanding of how different foods affect you and you will no longer have to measure or weigh food or monitor it as often.",
                "Learn how to add variations to your diet. As long as you stick to the principles of low-carb, high protein and fat eating, you can make some variations on the Atkins diet and still lose weight.\n\n\nPeople say boredom causes more people to rebound from diets than anything else, but in the case of Atkins it is actually lack of following the diet appropriately. They feel so deprived during a diet that they binge when they get off of it. This has to be a lifestyle with small splurges in moderation. Staying on Induction for too long and not adding more foods and carbs back to your diet as prescribed in Atkins is NOT Atkins. It is a very unhealthy version of dieting and should be avoided. Following Atkins is very healthy and safe and will ward off boredom.",
                "Jump-start the Atkins diet. Dr. Atkins prepared a section in one of his earlier books about a technique called the Fat Fast, which is based on the Kekwick diet. This jump-start method is only for people who follow Induction to the letter and cannot lose weight because of metabolic resistance.\n\n\nThe vast majority of dieters should simply start with Induction.",
                "Use Dr Atkins' diet as a vegetarian or vegan. You can do Atkins as a vegetarian or vegan, though you'll need to start at Phase 2 with around 30 grams of healthy carbohydrates per day. This article will help you to identify good sources of protein and fat. You’ll also learn exactly how to get started with Atkins depending on your weight loss goals.\n\n\nChoosing good vegetable proteins and fat sources will enable you to follow Atkins even if you don’t consume animal protein.\nMany plant proteins contain carbs. This may cause you to skip the induction phase.\nYou can start with OWL or Pre-Maintenance and still meet your weight loss goals.",
                "Understand the Eco-Atkins diet for weight loss. While no official guidelines for Eco-Atkins have been issued, there are still some guidelines to follow.[29]\n\nEat 25 percent of your calories from carb-rich foods.\nEat 30 percent of calories from proteins.\nEat 45 percent of calories from vegetable fats.",
                "Modify the Atkins diet and still lose weight and inches. You can modify Atkins to match your own weight loss goals, regardless of the amount planned. The Atkins diet is modified by starting or maintaining a certain phase for differing periods of time.[30]\n\nFor small weight loss goals, you may start with Pre-Maintencance or OWL.\nFor large weight loss goals start with Induction and move on to the Phase 2 after 2-4 weeks.",
                "Begin the new Atkins Advantage 12-week program. This article will teach you how to get started with Atkins Advantage. The new Atkins Advantage program can take you through a 12-week cycle of the Atkins diet starting with Induction and ending with Maintenance.\n\n\nThe new Atkins Advantage also includes exercise tips and journaling ideas to help your mental and emotional outlook."

        "How to Write a Compare and Contrast Essay": {
            "intro": "The purpose of a compare and contrast essay is to analyze the differences and/or the similarities of two distinct subjects. A good compare/contrast essay doesn’t only point out how the subjects are similar or different (or even both!). It uses those points to make a meaningful argument about the subjects. While it can be a little intimidating to approach this type of essay at first, with a little work and practice, you can write a great compare-and-contrast essay!",
            "steps": [
                "Pick two subjects that can be compared and contrasted. The first step to writing a successful compare and contrast essay is to pick two subjects that are different enough to be compared. There are several things to consider when choosing your subjects:[1]\n\nYou could pick two subjects that are in the same “category” but have differences that are significant in some way. For example, you could choose “homemade pizza vs. frozen grocery store pizza.”\nYou could pick two subjects that don’t appear to have anything in common but that have a surprising similarity. For example, you could choose to compare bats and whales. (One is tiny and flies, and the other is huge and swims, but they both use sonar to hunt.)\nYou could pick two subjects that might appear to be the same but are actually different. For example, you could choose \"The Hunger Games movie vs. the book.\"",
                "Make sure that your subjects can be discussed in a meaningful way. “Meaningful” comparisons and contrasts do more than simply point out that “Topic A and Topic B are both similar and different.” A good compare and contrast essay will help your readers understand why it’s useful or interesting to put these two subjects together.[2]\n\nFor example, ask yourself: What can we learn by thinking about “The Hunger Games” and “Battle Royale” together that we would miss out on if we thought about them separately?\nIt can be helpful to consider the “So what?” question when deciding whether your subjects have meaningful comparisons and contrasts to be made. If you say “The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are both similar and different,” and your friend asked you “So what?” what would your answer be? In other words, why bother putting these two things together?",
                "Brainstorm your topic. You probably won’t be able to jump straight from deciding on your topic to having a thesis, and that’s okay. Take a little time to brainstorm about how your chosen subjects are similar and different. This will help you see which points are the major ones you want to focus on, and can help guide you when you formulate your thesis.\n\n\nA “Venn diagram” can often be helpful when brainstorming. This set of overlapping circles can help you visualize where your subjects are similar and where they differ. In the outer edges of the circle, you write what is different; in the overlapping middle area, you write what’s similar.[3]\n\nYou can also just draw out a list of all of the qualities or characteristics of each subject. Once you’ve done that, start looking through the list for traits that both subjects share. Major points of difference are also good to note.",
                "Consider your main points. You won’t be able to provide a list of every single way in which your subjects are similar and/or different in your essay. (And that’s not the goal, anyway.) Instead, choose a few points that seem to be particularly important.\n\n\nFor example, if you are comparing and contrasting cats and dogs, you might notice that both are common household pets, fairly easy to adopt, and don’t usually have many special care needs. These are points of comparison (ways they are similar).\nYou might also note that cats are usually more independent than dogs, that dogs may not provoke allergies as much as cats do, and that cats don’t get as big as many dogs do. These are points of contrast (ways they are different).\nThese points of contrast can often be good places to start thinking about your thesis, or argument. Do these differences make one animal a superior type of pet? Or a better pet choice for a specific living situation (e.g., an apartment, a farm, etc.)?",
                "Develop your thesis. There are many directions a compare-and-contrast thesis can take, but it should always make an argument that explains why it’s useful to put these two subjects together in the first place. For example:\n\n\nShow readers why one subject is more desirable than the other. Example: \"Cats are better pets than dogs because they require less maintenance, are more independent, and are more adaptable.\"\nHelp readers make a meaningful comparison between two subjects. Example: \"New York City and San Francisco are both great cities for young professionals, but they differ in terms of their job opportunities, social environment, and living conditions.\"\nShow readers how two subjects are similar and different. Example: \"While both The Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird explore the themes of loss of innocence and the deep bond between siblings, To Kill a Mockingbird is more concerned with racism while The Catcher in the Rye focuses on the prejudices of class.\"\nIn middle school and high school, the standard format for essays is often the “5-paragraph form,” with an introduction, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. If your teacher recommends this form, go for it. However, you should be aware that especially in college, teachers and professors tend to want students to break out of this limited mode. Don’t get so locked into having “three main points” that you forget to fully explore your topic.",
                "Decide on a structure. There are several ways to organize a compare-and-contrast essay. Which one you choose depends on what works best for your ideas. Remember, you can change your organization later if you decide it isn’t working.[4][5]\n\n\nSubject by subject. This organization deals with all of the points about Topic A, then all of the points of Topic B. For example, you could discuss all your points about frozen pizza (in as many paragraphs as necessary), then all your points about homemade pizza. The strength of this form is that you don’t jump back and forth as much between topics, which can help your essay read more smoothly. It can also be helpful if you are using one subject as a “lens” through which to examine the other. The major disadvantage is that the comparisons and contrasts don’t really become evident until much further into the essay, and it can end up reading like a list of “points” rather than a cohesive essay.[6]\n\n\nPoint by point. This type of organization switches back and forth between points. For example, you could first discuss the prices of frozen pizza vs. homemade pizza, then the quality of ingredients, then the convenience factor. The advantage of this form is that it’s very clear what you’re comparing and contrasting. The disadvantage is that you do switch back and forth between topics, so you need to make sure that you use transitions and signposts to lead your reader through your argument.\n\nCompare then contrast. This organization presents all the comparisons first, then all the contrasts. It’s a pretty common way of organizing an essay, and it can be helpful if you really want to emphasize how your subjects are different. Putting the contrasts last places the emphasis on them. However, it can be more difficult for your readers to immediately see why these two subjects are being contrasted if all the similarities are first.[7]",
                "Outline your essay. Outlining your essay will help you work out the main organizational structure and will give you a template to follow as you develop your ideas. No matter how you decided to organize your essay, you will still need to have the following types of paragraphs:[8]\n\n\nIntroduction. This paragraph comes first and presents the basic information about the subjects to be compared and contrasted. It should present your thesis and the direction of your essay (i.e., what you will discuss and why your readers should care).\n\nBody Paragraphs. These are the meat of your essay, where you provide the details and evidence that support your claims. Each different section or body paragraph should tackle a different division of proof. It should provide and analyze evidence in order to connect those proofs to your thesis and support your thesis. Many middle-school and high-school essays may only require three body paragraphs, but use as many as is necessary to fully convey your argument.\n\nAcknowledgement of Competitive Arguments/Concession. This paragraph acknowledges that other counter-arguments exist, but discusses how those arguments are flawed or do not apply.\n\nConclusion. This paragraph summarizes the evidence presented. It will restate the thesis, but usually in a way that offers more information or sophistication than the introduction could. Remember: your audience now has all the information you gave them about why your argument is solid. They don’t need you to just reword your original thesis. Take it to the next level!",
                "Outline your body paragraphs based on subject-to-subject comparison. Let's say you're working with the following statement: \"When deciding between whether to go camping in the woods or spend a day at the beach, one should consider the following points: the weather, the types of activities each location offers, and the facilities at each location.\" A subject-by-subject comparison would deal first with the woods, and then with the beach. This method of organization can be unwieldy, so if you choose it, be sure not to let your paragraphs become page-long lists of points about each subject. You can still have a paragraph per point about each subject; you’ll just put all the paragraphs about each subject together. A subject-to-subject body paragraph outline could look like this:[9]\n\nIntroduction: state your intent to discuss the differences between camping in the woods or on the beach.\nBody Paragraph 1 (Woods): Climate/Weather\nBody Paragraph 2 (Woods): Types of Activities and Facilities\nBody Paragraph 3 (Beach): Climate/Weather\nBody Paragraph 4 (Beach): Types of Activities and Facilities\nConclusion",
                "Outline your body paragraphs based on point-by-point comparison. This is the more common method used in the comparison and contrast essay.[10] You can write a paragraph about each characteristic of both locations, comparing the locations in the same paragraph. For example, in this case, you could write one paragraph describing the weather in both the woods and the beach, one paragraph describing the activities in each location, and a third describing the facilities in both. Here's how the essay could look:[11]\n\nIntroduction\nBody Paragraph 1: Discuss first difference between woods and beaches: climate/weather.\n\nWoods\nBeach\n\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Discuss second difference between woods and beaches: types of activities.\n\nWoods\nBeach\n\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Discuss third difference between woods and beaches: available facilities.\n\nWoods\nBeach\n\n\nConclusion",
                "Outline your body paragraphs based on compare then contrast. This type of organization works best for when you want to emphasize the contrasts between your subjects. First, you discuss how your subjects are similar. Then, you end with how they’re different (and, usually, how one is superior). Here’s how your essay could look with this organization:\n\n\nIntroduction\nBody Paragraph 1: Similarity between woods and beaches (both are places with a wide variety of things to do)\nBody Paragraph 2: First difference between woods and beaches (they have different climates)\nBody Paragraph 3: Second difference between woods and beaches (there are more easily accessible woods than beaches in most parts of the country)\nBody Paragraph 4: Emphasis on the superiority of the woods to the beach\nConclusion",
                "Organize your individual body paragraphs. Once you've chosen an organizational method for your body paragraphs, you'll need to have an internal organization for the body paragraphs themselves. Each of your body paragraphs will need to have the three following elements:\n\n\nTopic sentence: This sentence introduces the main idea and subject of the paragraph. It can also provide a transition from the ideas in the previous paragraph.\nBody: These sentences provide concrete evidence that support the topic sentence and main idea.\nConclusion: this sentence wraps up the ideas in the paragraph. It may also provide a link to the next paragraph’s ideas.",
                "Use your brainstorming ideas to fill in your outline. Once you’ve outlined your essay, it should be fairly simple to find evidence for your arguments. Look at the lists and diagrams you generated to help you find the evidence for your comparisons and contrasts.\n\n\nIf you are having trouble finding evidence to support your argument, go back to your original texts and try the brainstorming process again. It could be that your argument is evolving past where it started, which is good! You just need to go back and look for further evidence.",
                "Remember to explain the “why.” A common error many writers make is to let the comparisons and contrasts “speak for themselves,” rather than explaining why it’s helpful or important to put them together. Don’t just provide a list of “ways Topic A and Topic B are similar and different.” In your body paragraphs as well as your conclusion, remind your readers of the significance of your evidence and argument.\n\n\nFor example, in a body paragraph about the quality of ingredients in frozen vs. homemade pizza, you could close with an assertion like this: “Because you actively control the quality of the ingredients in pizza you make at home, it can be healthier for you than frozen pizza. It can also let you express your imagination. Pineapple and peanut butter pizza? Go for it! Pickles and parmesan? Do it! Using your own ingredients lets you have fun with your food.” This type of comment helps your reader understand why the ability to choose your own ingredients makes homemade pizza better.",
                "Come up with a title. “Essay Number One” may say exactly what the paper is, but it’s not going to win any points for style. A good essay title will preview something about the paper’s argument or topic. Depending on your audience and the situation, you may make a joke or a pun, ask a question, or provide a summary of your main point.",
                "Take a break. One of the most common mistakes student writers make is to not give themselves enough time to take a step back from their essays for a day or two. Start early so that you can let your finished draft sit for a day, or at least a few hours. Then, come back to it with fresh eyes. You’ll find it easier to see holes in your logic or organizational flaws if you’ve had time to take a break.\n\n\nReading your essay aloud can also help you find problem spots. Often, when you’re writing you get so used to what you meant to say that you don’t read what you actually said.",
                "Review your essay. Look out for any grammatical errors, confusing phrasing, and repetitive ideas. Look for a balance in your paper: you should provide about the same amount of information about each topic to avoid bias. Here are some things to consider before you turn in your paper:\n\n\nAvoid bias. Don't use overly negative or defamatory language to show why a subject is unfavorable; use solid evidence to prove your points instead.\nAvoid first-person pronouns unless told otherwise. In some cases, your teacher may encourage you to use “I” and “you” in your essay. However, if the assignment or your teacher doesn’t mention it, stick with third-person instead, like “one may see” or “people may enjoy.” This is common practice for formal academic essays.\nProofread! Spelling and punctuation errors happen to everyone, but not catching them can make you seem lazy. Go over your essay carefully, and ask a friend to help if you’re not confident in your own proofreading skills.",
                "Write a body paragraph for a point-by-point compare and contrast essay. Here is a sample paragraph for a body paragraph that uses point-by-point comparison:\n\n\n\"When one is deciding whether to go to the beach or the woods, the type of activities that each location offers are an important point to consider. At the beach, one can enjoy the water by swimming, surfing, or even building a sandcastle with a moat that will fill with water. When one is in the woods, one may be able to go fishing or swimming in a nearby lake, or one may not be near water at all. At the beach, one can keep one's kids entertained by burying them in sand or kicking around a soccer ball; if one is in the woods, one can entertain one's kids by showing them different plans or animals. Both the beach and the woods offer a variety of activities for adults and kids alike.\"",
                "Write a body paragraph for a subject-by-subject compare and contrast essay. Here is a sample paragraph for a body paragraph that uses subject-by-subject comparison:\n\n\n\"The beach has a wonderful climate, many activities, and great facilities for any visitor's everyday use. If a person goes to the beach during the right day or time of year, he or she can enjoy warm, yet refreshing water, a cool breeze, and a relatively hot climate. At the beach, one can go swimming, sunbathe, or build sandcastles. There are also great facilities at the beach, such as a changing room, umbrellas, and conveniently-located restaurants and changing facilities. The climate, activities, and facilities are important points to consider when deciding between the beach and the woods.\""

        "wikiHow to Cry and Let It All Out": {
            "intro": "How long has it been since you last had a good, hard cry? Crying actually makes you feel better right away, because it's your body's method of releasing stress. But if you've gone months or years without crying, it can be hard to remember how to start. Going to a quiet place, freeing yourself from distractions, and letting yourself deeply feel emotions will put you in the right state of mind. See Step 1 and beyond to learn techniques that will help your tears flow freely.",
            "steps": [
                "Forget what you learned about crying. Were you taught that brave people don't cry? Many people who were raised to hold it all inside have a lot of trouble expressing emotions as adults. But crying is a necessary part of life that actually fosters good mental health. Crying can be an expression of sadness, pain, fear, joy, or just pure emotion, and it's a natural, healthy way to let those emotions run through our bodies.\n\n\nMen tend to have more trouble letting it all out than women do, primarily because men are taught to keep their emotions to themselves. But crying is just as natural for men as it is for women, even if they do it less often. Girls and boys cry the about the same amount until they reach age 12.[1] When they become adults, men cry 7 times a year on average, while women cry 47 times a year.[2]\n\nCrying is in no way a sign of weakness. It's an expression of emotion that has nothing to do with decision making. You can still take brave actions, even if you cry in anticipation. In fact, crying could help you process the emotions you're feeling and think more clearly about what's ahead.\nCrying is not for babies, contrary to what you might have heard. Children are more likely to cry because they have not yet internalized the idea that there's something wrong with it. But the need to cry does not go away when you grow up.",
                "See the benefits of crying. Crying is a way that humans release emotional tension. It's a natural bodily function that happens as a result of emotions building up and needing to be let out.[3] Interestingly, humans are the only mammals that produce tears as a way to express emotion. Crying is a survival mechanism that helps us in the following ways:\n\n\nIt relieves stress and lowers blood pressure. Over time intense stress and high blood pressure can lead to severe medical problems, and crying helps to mitigate these issues.[4]\n\nIt's a way to remove toxins that build up when you're upset. Certain chemicals build up in your system when you're stressed, and crying helps to expel them through tears - especially emotional tears, as opposed to tears formed as a result of irritation.[5]\n\nIt boosts your mood immediately afterward. This isn't just in people's heads - it's a scientific fact. When you cry, your level of manganese gets lower. The buildup of manganese leads to stress and anxiety, so crying is nature's way of easing emotional pain.[6]",
                "Figure out why you hold it all in. Now that you know all the good things that come about when you cry, think about what might be stopping your own tears from flowing. If it has been a long time since you've been able to cry, you may need to make a conscious effort to get to the point where you can release your emotions through tears.\n\n\nDo you harbor negative thoughts about crying? If so, try to change your views and see that there's nothing wrong with crying - it's good for you.\nDo you have trouble expressing feelings in general? Allowing yourself to cry will be a good start for you. Being able to process emotions in this way will help you be more emotional in general.\nWhen you push your feelings down and keep yourself from crying, those feelings don't go away. You may feel either angry or numb.",
                "Give yourself permission. Letting yourself cry is a way to take better care of yourself. It's a way to honor your feelings instead of denying them and pushing them down. When you cry, you're allowing yourself to be you. Giving yourself this emotional freedom will have a positive effect on your mental health.[7]\n\nIf you're struggling to allow yourself to express emotion, imagine yourself as a child. Think about how you were free to be yourself then, crying when you felt sad that a fun day had to end, or when you fell off your bike and scraped your knees. The events that make you cry as an adult will be different from those that made you burst into tears as a child, but you can still try to recapture that sense of emotional freedom.\nIt might also help to think about how you treat others when they cry. Do you tell them to stop, to hold it in? When your best friend feels overcome and starts crying, you probably give them a hug and encourage them to let it all out. Treating yourself with the same kindness, rather than self-censuring, could help you feel comfortable enough to cry.",
                "Find a good place to cry. Most people who have trouble letting themselves cry prefer to experience their emotions alone, away from others. It can be easier to let yourself truly experience your feelings when you aren't worried about what someone else is thinking. There's certainly nothing wrong with crying in front of others, but you might find it more relaxing to be by yourself at first.\n\n\nYour bedroom might be a good choice if it's a private, quiet place.\nIf your house has a lot of other people in it, try driving somewhere private so you can cry in the car. But make sure you feel well enough while driving there and back; crying while driving can be dangerous.\nYou can also cry in the shower - no one will hear you there.\nBeing outside might help you free up your mind to process emotions. Look for a private spot in the park or on the beach.",
                "Clear your head of distractions. Many people push their feelings aside and bury themselves in distractions to keep from crying. This technique is so effective that it can result in going months or years without crying. At the first sign of sadness, do you tend to turn on the TV and spend the evening laughing at your favorite show? Next time you start feeling down, resist that impulse and allow yourself to feel the emotion. It's the first step to having a good, hard cry.\n\n\nThere are many other types of distractions. You might stay late at work every night, spend all your time going out instead of being alone, or read articles online until you fall asleep. Think about what you tend to do when you're not in the mood to feel emotional, and make the decision to stop and focus on your emotions.",
                "Think deeply about what's making you sad. Instead of letting your thoughts skip away to something less important, focus your mind on the emotions swirling around in your head. Just let yourself think through them instead of trying to push them away.\n\n\nIf you're sad, think hard about the event that brought about these feelings. Think about how much you wish it hadn't happened, what your life was like before, and what your life will be like from now on. Let yourself understand and feel the loss of what might have been.\nNo matter what strong emotion is causing you to want to cry, think it through and allow it to take a prominent spot in your brain. Observe how much it's stressing you out, and what a relief it would be if the problem would just go away.",
                "Let your emotions swell until you cry. Are you starting to feel your throat tighten a little? Don't swallow and force yourself to stop thinking about what's making you sad. Instead, let your emotions overcome you. Keep thinking about what you wish hadn't happened. When the tears start to flow, don't resist them.\n\n\nOnce you really start crying, it'll probably be hard to stop. Keep crying until you've \"let it all out\" - you'll know when you're done.\nThe average length of a bout of crying is six minutes.[8]",
                "Feel better. When you're finished crying, think about how you feel. If you're like most people, you'll find that your brain feels a bit freer of the emotion that was bogging you down. You might not feel joyful right away, but you probably feel calmer, less anxious, and ready to take on your problems. Hold onto that feeling, and get into the habit of crying when you need to. It'll get easier with practice.\n\n\nAccording to one study, 85% of women report feeling better after crying, while 73% of men do.[9]\n\nIf you don't feel good after crying, consider why. It can be hard to shake off years of being told that crying is weak, and so on. If you're embarrassed that you cried, try to remember that it's completely natural and healthy.",
                "Look at old pictures. This is a surefire way to get the tears flowing if you're sad about a particular person, your family, or how much life has changed. Go through an old photo album or pull up pictures online and allow yourself to gaze at each one for as long as you want. Remember the good times you had with the people in the pictures, or how much you loved a particular place.",
                "Watch a sad movie. It can be very cathartic to watch a movie with a plot so sad it makes you cry. Even if the actors are in a situation completely different from yours, watching them go through sad times and cry themselves might help turn on your tears. When you do start crying during a movie, let your thoughts turn to your situation, so you can process your feelings about your own life. If you need suggestions for a sad movie to watch, try these:\n\n\nSteel Magnolias\nStella Dallas\nBreaking the Waves\nBlue Valentine\nRudy\nThe Green Mile\nSchindler's List\nInside Out\nTitanic\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas\nMy Girl\nMarley And Me\nThe Book Thief\nRoom\nRomeo + Juliet\nThe Notebook\nThe Fault in Our Stars\nThe Giver\nUp\nOld Yeller\nWhere the Red Fern Grows\nHachi\nForrest Gump",
                "Listen to emotional music. The right music can be the perfect way to help your emotions loom larger in your brain. One of the best ways to use music to help you cry is to pick an album or song you listened to at a different time in your life, or one that reminds you strongly of someone who is gone. If there's no particular song or artist who fits the bill, try one of these extremely sad songs:\n\n\n\"Not the Love We Dream Of\" - Gary Numan\n\"Lost\" - Gary Numan\n\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" - Hank Williams\n\"Hurt\" - Johnny Cash\n\"Tears in Heaven\" - Eric Clapton\n\"On My Own\" - Les Misérables\n\"Jolene\" - Dolly Parton\n\"Motion Picture Soundtrack (solo piano)\" - Radiohead\n\"Say it Like You Mean It\" - Matchbook Romance\n\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\" - Otis Redding\n\"How Could This Happen To Me\" - Simple Plan\n\"I Know You Care\" - Ellie Goulding\n\"Goodbye My Lover\" - James Blunt\n\"Carry You Home\" - James Blunt\n\"All By Myself\" - Celine Dion\n\"My Heart Will Go On\" - Celine Dion\n\"Young and Beautiful\" - Lana Del Rey\n\"The Ice Is Getting Thinner\" - Death Cab for Cutie\n\"Too Late\" - M83\n\"Welcome to the Black Parade\" - MCR\n\"With Light There is Hope\" - Princess One Point Five\n\"Apologize\" - One Republic\n\"Night Owl\" - Gerry Rafferty\n\"Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space\" - Spiritualized\n\"8 Billion\" - Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross\n\"Cry Like a Rainstorm\" - Linda Ronstadt\n\"Shot\" - Rochelle Jordan\n\"The Call\" - Regina Spektor\n\"Blue Lips\" - Regina Spektor\n\"If You Could See Me Now\" - The Script\n\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" - Radiohead\n\"Remember Everything\" - Five Finger Death Punch\n\"Scars\" - Papa Roach\n\"Var\" - Sigur Rós\n\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\" - The Script\n\"Coming Down\" - Five Finger Death Punch\n\"The Scientist\" - Coldplay\n\"Wait\" - M83\n\"Wound\" - Arca\n\"Echoes of Silence\" - The Weeknd\n\"Fourth of July\" - Sufjan Stevens",
                "Write down your feelings. Put a pen to paper and try to capture the essence of your feelings. You can start by writing down a description of the source of your emotions. Describe the ins and outs of your breakup, discuss the last few months of your father's illness, write about how you lost your job at the start of the recession. Then go deeper and write about how that event has changed your life, and what you're feeling as a result. Writing down memories is also a good way to bring yourself to the point of tears.[10]",
                "Confide in a friend if you are comfortable with it. It can really help to talk to someone else about what made you sad, angry, or overwhelmed. Discuss your feelings until you have nothing left to talk about or cry about."

        "How to Be a Loner in High School": {
            "intro": "Loners are subjected to a great deal of negative stereotyping. However, many loners are perfectly healthy people who simply prefer to spend their time alone. If you would like to be a loner in high school, you will need to minimize your conversations with your peers. Try to find spaces where you can spend some private time recharging. Embrace your own individual style and ignore the opinions of others. Most importantly, stick with the loner lifestyle just for as long as it makes you happy.",
            "steps": [
                "Keep conversations brief. If someone begins to talk to you, try to keep your answers short and to the point. Providing very little information or encouragement will let them know that you are not interested in a long chat. However, do listen carefully in case they say something of importance to you.[1]\n\nAvoiding eye contact will make your classmates less likely to approach you for conversation. Instead of looking directly at one person, try to skim the room with your eyes.\nBeing a loner doesn’t mean that you can’t provide a reaction to what someone says to you. If a person is talking and you feel like offering your sympathy, do so. In fact, introverts are often known for their emotional awareness.\nNoncommittal responses such as, “Uh-huh,” and, “Mm-hm,” often signal to other people that you are not engaged in the conversation. This will usually lead to a talk being cut short.",
                "Head directly to the bus after school. Instead of hanging around in the hallways or outside of the school to socialize, make your way to your ride home. The sooner that you get home, the sooner you can recharge in peace and privacy. If you take this same action every day it will become a routine and your classmates will know what to expect.[2]\n\nYou may want to time your arrival at the bus carefully, otherwise you could end up sitting and waiting for it to fill up.",
                "Use technology as a distraction. Cell phones are generally not allowed in the classroom. However, you may be able to bring your headphones and wear them in the cafeteria and other public spaces. You can also use your phone in permitted areas. Getting on a library computer also sends a message that you want your space.[3]\n\nJust make sure that you are still aware of your surroundings as you immerse yourself in technology. For example, watch where you are walking as you make your way around campus.",
                "Stay away from crowded areas. Find a place to sit away from others in the cafeteria. Try to walk on the edges of the hallway away from where people are congregating. Don’t hang around in the classroom immediately after class. The fewer people you encounter, the fewer random conversations and forced social interactions you will have.[4]\n\nIt is a common misconception that all loners are shy. Many loners are perfectly fine in social situations, they just prefer to avoid them if possible. Loners can often be classified as introverts at heart.",
                "Find a private space of your own. Get to know your school environment and look for a few places that you can escape to during the day for some privacy and solitude. This is especially important to do if you find your classroom time to be mentally draining. Escaping in this way shows that you are a loner by choice, not by circumstance.[5]\n\nIf one of your fellow students questions you about your habit of disappearing, simply tell them that sometimes you prefer to be alone.[6]\n\nLook for places currently not in use, such as the school theater or empty classrooms.",
                "Avoid major social events. Instead of attending the seasonal dance with a large group, go by yourself or not at all. You could always spend that time pursuing a hobby that you enjoy, such as painting. If you attend a function requiring tickets, purchase the seats around you to ensure your solitude.[7]\n\nIf someone makes a big deal about you not going to a particular event, just remind yourself that your peers are busy with their own lives, so everything will blow over rather quickly.[8]",
                "Locate one or two trusted confidantes. This is not a necessity, as it may make you feel like less of a ‘true’ loner. However, everyone needs help on occasion and having a few classmates you can turn to for assistance is never a bad idea. Just remember to return any favors as soon as possible so that you don’t feel indebted to anyone.[9]\n\nJust because you are a loner in high school doesn’t mean that you can’t have friends or a social life outside of that space either. If you have a best friend from childhood, who goes to a different school, look to that person for support.",
                "Stick with your own fashion style. Don’t feel the need to follow all of the latest trends. Embrace your own unique appearance and work to refine it over time. Wear clothes that suit your personality and mood. Being comfortable in your own skin will give you more confidence in all of your choices, including being a loner.[10]\n\nMost people are aware of the stereotype of the trench coat wearing, troubled loner teen. If you choose to dress this way do so because you enjoy it, not to conform to some image.",
                "Stay polite. No matter how frustrated you become with other people attempting to reach out to you, avoid the desire to head into rude territory. Stay true to your morals and give them minimal time, but not an abrupt brush-off. Most people are extroverts and have no clue how to interpret your loner signals.[11]\n\nSome polite ways to exit a conversation include saying, “Okay, well, I have to make my next class,” or, “I’ve got to go now or I’ll be late.”",
                "Develop some individual hobbies. Being a loner doesn’t mean you can’t be interesting. In fact, many loners become recognized artists due to their abilities to channel their inner energies outward. Investigate learning a musical instrument on your own. Or, try your hand at another artistic pursuit, such as writing or painting.[12]\n\nOne of the reasons that Bruce Springsteen started playing music was to find an outlet for his feelings as a high school loner. Just because you are a loner doesn’t mean you are alone in your experiences.[13]\n\nIt is also possible that you gravitate toward being a loner because you hold potential friends to higher creative standards as a result of your own artistic impulses. Being aware of this can help you to reassess your expectations of others, if you desire.[14]",
                "Be confident. Try your best to not care about the opinions of others, including those of your peers. Focus on your own inner strength and take actions that make you feel comfortable, not the ones that will make you ‘fit in.’ Part of being a confident person is not accepting bullying. Don’t allow anyone to victimize you for your loner status.[15]",
                "Choose a few loner idols or mentors. Search online for the stories of other loners. You will find that many celebrities self-identify as former, or current, loners. Your research will show you that, for most loners, there is nothing unhealthy or unnatural about this affinity. You simply crave privacy.[16]",
                "Be a survivor. Be aware that your loner status may make you a target for ridicule in your present, or future, life. So, it is important to be flexible and to adapt to your situation the best that you can. Perhaps you need to wait until the end of the day to get alone time. If that is the case, then so be it. Perhaps you have to discuss your work in a group project setting. If that is the case, then so be it.[17]",
                "Change your behaviors if you are lonely. Practice introspection on a daily basis and ask yourself if being a loner is making you happy. If the answer is yes, then continue as is. If the answer is no, then start to open yourself up a bit more to social experiences while in high school. Pay attention to any feelings of loneliness, in particular. Your decision to be a loner can be reversed, if you choose to do so.[18]\n\nLoneliness actually leads to the build-up of stress within your body. Over time it can cause a host of health problems if it is not addressed.[19]",
                "Watch out for the stereotypes. Humans usually reach out for social interaction, so, as a loner, you may be the focus of other’s curiosity or fear. In particular, as a result of some of the violent acts committed by self-described loners in school environments, some of your classmates may attach negative stereotypes to your choice. Try to alleviate their concerns by being polite and engaged, just busy with other concerns.[20]",
                "Don’t give in to peer pressure. Some of your peers may try to ply you with alcohol or drugs in order to get you back into the social group. Be prepared for this and feel confident in your refusal. Others may assume that you are interested in these illicit activities simply because you are a loner. Brush these advances off as well.[21]\n\nIf you are offered drugs or alcohol, you might simply say, “Sorry, I’m not into that.”",
                "Talk to the school counselor. If you feel as if your emotions are bottled up as a result of your loner status, reach out to professionals at your school. They will keep these conversations confidential and you can unload what is on your mind. Be aware that you can also visit with your counselor to discuss how happy you are as a loner.[22]\n\nIf you are satisfied with your life as a loner, your counselor may be able to offer suggestions regarding future career options that will suit your personality. Many loners find satisfying work as writers or completing other solitary pursuits.[23]",
                "Talk to your parents. Your parents may be concerned about your life as a loner, especially if they are both extroverts. Spend time talking with them and let them know that you are okay and happy. If you are unhappy, you can also reach out to your parents for assistance and ask for their advice.[24]",
                "Talk to a medical professional. If you feel like hurting yourself or others, you should talk to your parents or school professionals and get them to make you a counseling appointment outside of the school environment. It is important that you don’t keep these feelings bottled up. There are ways to improve your situation, but you have to go against your natural instincts and reach out to others."

            "intro": "Busy people may not find time in their schedules to do the recommended 150 to 175 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise per week. A UK study found that the average British woman spends 143 minutes per week cleaning their house. If you are the main caretaker of your own house or another residence, then you may be able to count regular cleaning and chores as part of your exercise time. Many household chores are considered medium intensity cardiovascular or strength-training exercises. Plan your chores in a way that allows you to do them in succession to increase heart rate and work your major muscle groups. Read more to find out how to exercise while doing your housework.",
            "steps": [
                "Set a timer for 30 minutes, the minimum amount of moderate-intensity exercise you should have in a workout session. Constant exercise is the key to turning regular chores into an aerobic exercise that helps your heart and lungs.",
                "Turn on some fast music. Recent studies have shown that loud music with at least 120 beats per minute (BPM) helps to increase the rate at which you exercise. They also can distract you and improve your mood, allowing you to workout for a longer period of time.\n\n\nCreate a playlist that lasts at least 30 minutes. This can serve as your timer. Playing your favorite songs in succession will also increase the endorphin-boosting power of music. Try dance, Latin, hip hop and fast rock songs. Go to bpmdatabase.com to check if your favorite song has 120 BPM or more .",
                "Put on flexible clothing and athletic trainers before you workout. Some household chores require good foot cushioning and stability in order to perform them without the risk of injury.",
                "Vacuum your entire house. The forward and back motion of vacuuming is a great workout for your abdominal muscles (abs). Flex your muscles 1 at a time, beginning at your pelvis and moving into your upper abs, and keep them flexed for the entire duration of your vacuuming.\n\n\nYou burn approximately 190 calories per hour vacuuming. Increase the calories you burn by performing single leg lunges every 2 to 3 minutes. Take a large step forward with your right leg and lunge until your right knee is at a 90 degree angle. Hold the position for 3 to 10 seconds and then step back. Repeat with your left leg.",
                "Sweep and/or mop your floors. Ready the floors so you can do as many surfaces as possible in succession. Flex your ab muscles and squat rather than bend if you need to get into a hard to reach space.\n\n\nMopping burns approximately 195 calories per hour. Make sure you switch arms as you sweep, mop or rake. You should reach and pull back with your right and left sides evenly. Favoring 1 side will create a muscle imbalance and may lead to pain. Get on your hands and knees and scrub intensely. This cleaning exercise works your shoulders and upper arms intensely.",
                "Run or walk up and down your stairs 5 to 10 times. You can do this while tidying different rooms, bringing objects from 1 room to another. You can also do it simply to burn more calories and increase the intensity of your workout.\n\n\nYou burn approximately 500 calories per hour walking up and down stairs. Increase your strength-training by squatting whenever you pick up objects. Lean slightly back and pick up an object when your arms are close to the floor. Bending over causes intense strain on your lower back. Squatting builds the quadriceps, hamstring and ab muscles, helping you help your back when done repeatedly.",
                "Do calf raises as you hand wash dishes. Start with your legs hip-width apart. Move onto your toes and hold for 3 to 10 seconds, and then slowly come down.\n\n\nRepeat this exercise 10 times and do 2 to 3 sets with 1 minute resting between sets.",
                "Squat as you pick up a laundry basket, and then set it on a table or couch near a wall. Lean against the wall with your feet hip-width apart and 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) away from the wall. Flex your abs, bend your knees and move your back down the wall, squatting as you fold laundry for 10 to 30 seconds.\n\n\nReturn to the original position, rest for a few seconds and repeat until you are done folding your laundry.",
                "Clean all your windows to work your arms. Use your left and right hands equally as you wipe in a circular motion. Reach up as high as you can to work your abs, glutes and lower back muscles.\n\n\nYou burn approximately 180 calories per hour cleaning windows. You work approximately the same calories per hour dusting the house, which also works your upper and lower arm muscles.",
                "Weed or hoe your garden. Make sure to use proper knee cushioning and engage your ab and lower back muscles if you lean forward. This gardening exercise burns approximately 289 calories per hour.",
                "Wash your car by hand. The motions of wetting, scrubbing and rinsing can work your arm, back, and leg muscles. Try to squat every time you wet your chamois or sponge into soapy water, instead of bending over.\n\n\nThis exercise burns approximately 230 calories per hour.",
                "Clean your gutters. Flex your ab and gluteal muscles as you stand on the ladder, which will improve your balance. This burns approximately 320 calories per hour.",
                "Paint indoors or outdoors. Use either brushes or rollers and tighten your abs as you reach to get higher places. Before using a ladder, try to reach as high as you can get on the wall, as it strengthens your core muscles.\n\n\nPainting burns between 250 and 300 calories per hour if done on large surfaces, like walls."

        "How to Kill Head Lice Naturally": {
            "intro": "Head lice, also called pediculosis capitis, are tiny parasitic insects that infest the human scalp and feed on the person’s blood.[1] Most common in children, head lice is usually the result of direct transfer of the lice from the one person to another.[2] Head lice are not a sign of poor hygiene and they don’t cause any infectious diseases.[3] Although there is little clinical evidence of their efficacy, using natural remedies may kill head lice without harsh chemicals.[4]",
            "steps": [
                "Wet-comb your hair. Use a fine-toothed nit comb to comb the entire length of wet and lubricated hair. This may remove lice and some of their nits, or eggs, if done for several weeks.[5]\n\nPurchase a nit comb at a pharmacy, grocery store or another large retailer.\nWet the hair with water and use something such as hair conditioner to lubricate it.[6]\n\nRun the nit comb the length of the hair at least twice during a session.[7]\n\nRepeat the process every three to four days for several weeks. Do this for at least two weeks after you find no more lice in your hair.[8]\n\nUse a light directed on the scalp to illuminate the area on which you’re combing.[9]\n\nA magnifying glass may also help you more effectively see the area you’re combing.[10]\n\nComb sections that are about 1 inch by ½ inch, starting at the scalp and ending with the tip. Make sure to clean the comb with a tissue and some hot water after you’ve combed each section.[11]\n\nPin up sections of the hair you’ve already combed to ensure that you get your entire scalp.[12]",
                "Apply essential oils. There is some evidence that applying natural plants oils to the hair may kill lice and eggs and soothe related itching.[13] Be aware that although essential oils may work against, they are not approved by the Federal Drug Administration to meet safety, efficacy, and manufacturing standards, and may cause damage to your scalp if not used properly.[14]\n\nUse essential oils such as tea tree oil, anise oil, ylang ylang oil for lice and their nits. You can also look for plant oils containing nerolidol, which is a chemical compound found in many plant oils.[15] Examples of this kind of oils includes: neroli, ginger, jasmine, and lavender.[16]\n\nMix about 50 drops of your chosen essential oil or oils with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil.[17]\n\nApply the mixture to your hair and cover it with a plastic shower cap. Then wrap this with a towel.[18]\n\nLeave it on your hair for an hour and then shampoo your hair thoroughly to rinse out any lice and nits.[19]\n\nYou can buy essential oils at most health food stores, some pharmacies, and many grocery stores.",
                "Smother lice and nits overnight. There are several household products that may deprive lice and nits of air.[20] Applying a coat of any of these smothering agents to your hair and leaving it on overnight may treat your lice infestation.[21]\n\nApply mayonnaise, olive oil, butter, or petroleum jelly to your hair.[22]\n\nPut on a shower cap over the smothering agent and leave on the mixture and cap overnight.[23]\n\nIn the morning, remove the smothering agent with baby oil and by shampooing and rinsing your hair thoroughly.[24] Be aware that because of the nature of these products, that it may take a lot of work to get them out of your hair.[25]\n\nRepeat this process several nights in a row.[26]",
                "Rinse hair with a water and vinegar. After successfully killing lice and nits, combine a mixture of 50% water and 50% vinegar. This can help dissolve the bodies of dead nits and may also help remove any lingering lice or nits in your hair.[27]\n\nRub the mixture vigorously into your hair and rinse thoroughly.[28]\n\nA mixture of vinegar and olive oil may also work.[29]",
                "Avoid flammable products. No matter what natural remedy you choose to treat lice, never use any product that is flammable on your hair. Kerosene and gasoline can cause serious harm to your health and also increase your risk of having your hair catch on fire if exposed to flames.[30]",
                "Clean household items. Although lice usually don’t survive past one day off the scalp, you may want to clean household items as a precaution.[31] Wash and clean any items the affected person has used within the past two days.[32]\n\nWash bedding, stuffed animals, and clothing in hot and soapy water. The water should be at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius). Dry items at a high heat.[33]\n\nWash hair care items such as combs, brushes, and accessories in hot, soapy water.[34] Soak the items in water that is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius) for 5-10 minutes.[35]\n\nSeal any items that you cannot clean or wash in a plastic bag for two weeks to deprive the lice and nits of air.[36]\n\nVacuum your floors and any upholstered furniture.[37]",
                "Inspect vigilantly. After any treatment and for a couple of weeks following treatment, inspect your head vigilantly for evidence of any lice or their nits. This can help prevent the spread to other individuals and help ensure that you don’t have any lingering lice or eggs that need treatment.[38]\n\nNits hatch 7-11 days after being laid, so check your scalp for at least two weeks after treatment.[39]\n\nYou may want to use a magnifying glass and lamp to inspect hair and other household items.[40]\n\nCheck the hair daily until the infestation is gone and then every week thereafter to detect any reinfestation.[41]",
                "Contact the source of the infestation. Schools and child care facilities are the most commons sources of lice infestations, though they can occur any place.[42] Contact the place that you believe is the source of the infestation in order to alert them to the possibility that others may also have it.[43]\n\nLet the source know that you are treating your own infestation.",
                "Separate personal items. In general, it’s a good idea to separate personal items as much as possible. This can minimize the risk of lice and nits spreading to others and also prevent reinfestation.[44]\n\nPlace coats, hats, and scarves on separate hooks as much as possible.[45]",
                "Use only your own personal items. It’s important not to share any personal items that you may have. This can prevent any type of head lice and nit transmission.[46]\n\nOnly use your own comb, brush, hat, and scarf.[47]\n\nMake sure to use your own protective sports headgear such as helmets.[48]",
                "See your doctor. If you find that successive natural treatments don’t kill lice, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She may prescribe medication for the lice or any related skin infection, or your doctor may be able to identify if your “lice” is another condition such as dandruff.[49]\n\nPersistent itching from lice can break the skin and cause infections.[50]\n\nLice can look like other conditions including: dandruff, residue from hair products, beads of dead hair tissue on the hair shaft, scab tissue, other small insects in the hair.[51]"

            "intro": "Leg cramps, sometimes called charley horses, come on quickly, can last for a few seconds to several minutes, and can be quite painful. While any muscle can spasm or cramp, the muscles that are most commonly involved in leg cramps are the calf muscles in the lower part of the leg, the hamstrings, or the muscles along the back of the thigh, and the quadriceps, found along the front of the thigh. Quickly treating the cramped muscle causes the pain to stop, but sometimes you may need to take additional steps if you have frequent leg cramps.",
            "steps": [
                "Stretch the cramped muscle. Muscle cramps are sudden and unexpected contractions or spasms of a muscle. To stop the cramp quickly, the cramped muscle needs to be stretched.[1]\n\nBy stretching the muscle, you are preventing it from remaining in the contracted or cramped position.[2]\n\nStretching a cramped muscle works best if you can hold the stretched position for about a minute, or until the cramp feels better. You may need to repeat the stretched position if you feel the cramp returning.[3]",
                "Try the towel stretch. If you have a towel handy, you can use it to gently stretch your hamstring and calf muscles:[4]\n\nLie down on your back.\nPlace the towel under the ball of one foot. Hold both ends of the towel taut.\nKeep your knee straight and slowly lift it until you feel a gentle stretch in the back of your leg.\nAdjust the towel so the ankle bends toward you. This helps stretch your calf muscles and relieve your nerves.\nHold this stretch for 30 seconds..",
                "Stretch the calf muscle. If your calf muscle is cramping, there are several stretches you can do without needing a towel or a place to lie down. Here are three of them:\n\n\nPut your weight on the leg that has the cramp, and slightly bend your knee, while keeping your foot flat on the floor.[5]\n\nFace a wall, stand a short distance away, and lean against the wall using your hands for support. Keep your cramped leg straight, and the foot and heel on the floor, as you lean your upper body into the wall.[6]\n\nPosition yourself with your hands on the wall. Place the toe area of your foot, of the leg with the cramping calf muscles, against the wall and your heel on the floor. Keep your leg straight and lean your upper body closer to the wall to stretch the calf muscle.\nIf you are not able to stand, then sit with your cramped leg extended. Pull the top of your foot towards your head and chest area, keeping your leg straight.[7]",

If the towel exercise didn't solve a cramping hamstring, try one of these instead:\n\n\nSit down and pull your foot towards your head and chest area, keeping your leg straight.[8]\n\nLie on your back and pull your knees to your chest. If someone is available, they can help by gently putting additional pressure on your knees, forcing them a little closer to your chest.",
                "Stretch your quadriceps muscle. Have a chair or wall nearby to steady yourself. Bend the knee of your cramped leg, and grab your foot. Pull your foot up towards your lower back and buttocks area.[9]",
                "Massage the area of your leg that is cramping. Gently massaging the cramped muscle can help it to relax.[10]",
                "Apply heat. Using methods to apply warmth to the area can help the muscle to relax and soothe the pain from the cramp.[11]\n\nMethods used to apply heat include using a warm towel, a heating pad, or taking a warm bath or shower. Most people feel relief when warmth is applied to a cramped muscle, plus it improves circulation..[12]",
                "Consider using ice. Some people report benefit with applications of ice to a cramped muscle. Determine what works best for you.[13]\n\nAvoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Fill a small to medium sized baggie with ice, and add enough water to barely cover the ice. Squeeze the air out, seal it well, then wrap the baggie with damp towel, and apply it to the area.\nAnother quick option is to use a bag of frozen veggies, like peas or corn. Wrap the package in a damp towel and apply it to the area.",
                "Understand why you are having leg cramps. To prevent future painful episodes, it is helpful to understand what happened that triggered the cramp.[14]",
                "Talk to your doctor. If you have repeated problems with leg cramps, if you are elderly, have diabetes or liver disease, nerve compression caused by problems in your lower back, poor circulation in your legs, or thyroid disease, you may be at greater risk of developing leg cramps.[15]\n\nSome medications, like diuretics used to treat high blood pressure, can cause changes in your body that normally keep minerals and electrolytes in balance. Your doctor may be able to adjust your medications to help.\nYour doctor can help you to treat the underlying problem that is causing your leg cramps.[16]",
                "Adjust your exercise routines. Don’t overdo it. Exercise is important to your overall health, but if you are having leg cramps, then your body is having trouble keeping up with your routine.[17]\n\nAdjust your activity to include exercises or activities that use other muscle groups, as your leg muscles adjust to the level of intensity you are working towards.[18]",
                "Shorten your work-out duration. Muscle cramps are more common as the muscles get fatigued, fluids become depleted, and electrolytes in the system may not be adequate. All of these factors can happen simultaneously when your work-outs are lengthy.\n\n\nIf you are experiencing frequent leg cramps, shorten the duration of your work-outs. Then develop a system to very gradually increase the length of your exercise routines as your leg muscles become accustomed to the strenuous activity.",
                "Stay hydrated. One of the most common causes of muscle cramps is dehydration during exercise or sporting activities, especially in extreme heat.[19]\n\nIncrease the amount of water you drink just before, and during your activities. Even drinking water while you are having a cramp can help to relieve it.[20]\n\nWater alone may not be enough. During heavy exercise your body is also using electrolytes that need to be replenished. Depleting electrolytes in your body causes muscle cramps.[21]\n\nProvide more electrolytes in your system by drinking sports drinks, using salt tablets, and eating more foods that contain electrolytes, such as bananas and oranges.[22]\n\nEvery person is different, so there is no method to determine the exact amount of each electrolyte you would need to consume in order to prevent leg cramps.\nAs you exercise, and even as your body sweats during warmer weather, your muscles use more electrolytes than normal.\nIf you are experiencing leg cramps while you exercise, then it is likely that your body is using up the available electrolytes, therefore you need to replace them.\nThe easiest way to do this is by drinking a sports beverage that contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. These minerals, or electrolytes, keep your muscles working in a healthy way.\nTalk to your doctor before using salt tablets. While commonly used by endurance athletes, they may not be the best option for mild to moderate levels of exercise.",
                "Adjust your diet. Eat foods that are rich in minerals including calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.[23][24]\n\nExamples of foods that are rich in calcium and magnesium include milk, fish, meats, eggs, and fruit.\nInclude foods in your diet each day that contain potassium. Some foods rich in potassium include bananas, fish, avocados, and potatoes.\nAlso be sure to get enough salt in your diet. If the weather is hot, and you are sweating from the warmer temperatures, you may want to consider drinking a sports drink each day that contains electrolytes, including sodium, or sodium chloride.",
                "Stretch before and after you exercise. Stretching those muscles before you begin warms them up, improves blood flow to the area, and improves overall flexibility.[25] This not only helps prevent cramps, but also promotes good posture and healthy joints and spine.\n\n\nMany athletes also swear by stretching after exercise to relieve muscle fatigue and soreness. This may help your muscle tissue to relax, release any unwanted chemicals that might have accumulated during your work-out, and help to provide adequate blood flow to the muscle tissue.[26]\n\nWhile stretching after exercise does not always prevent muscle cramps from happening, it can help to improve the overall health of your muscle tissue.",
                "Anticipate leg cramps from swimming. While swimming is great exercise, it is also a common cause of leg cramps. Take proper safety steps as you start swimming, especially if you do not swim year round, and if you are swimming in colder water.[27]\n\nCold water impairs the circulation to your leg muscles as you swim. Take safety precautions to avoid swimming alone, just in case you should experience a cramp in water where it is too deep to touch bottom.[28]",
                "Stretch before bedtime. Often, leg cramps occur at night. If this is happening to you, then stretch your leg muscles before you go to bed, and be sure you are adequately hydrated.[29]\n\nLight exercise just before bed may also help to avoid the leg cramps at night. Take a short walk, or ride a stationary bike for a few minutes prior to going to bed.[30]",
                "Avoid sitting for the majority of the day. Under-conditioned muscles are a cause of recurrent leg cramps.[31]\n\nIf your job requires sitting, try to take breaks at least every 60 minutes and walk around. Even just standing up and “wiggling” is better than constantly sitting. Walk during your lunch break if possible.[32]",
                "Talk to your doctor about vitamin supplements. If you are frequently experiencing leg cramps during your pregnancy, talk with your doctor to be sure your prenatal vitamin has adequate amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium.[33]\n\nDo not make any changes to your vitamin supplement without the advice of your doctor.",
                "Stretch the muscle that is cramping. Your pregnancy is not impacted by stretching muscles that are cramping.",
                "Stretch your calf muscles before bed. In most women, especially during the second and third trimester, nocturnal leg cramps become more common.[34]\n\nThe calf muscles are the most common muscle group that tends to cramp at night during pregnancy.\nStretch your calf muscles each night before bed by standing arm’s length away from a wall, put your hands on the wall, then place one foot behind the other.\nGently bend the knee of your leg closest to the wall, and keep your back leg straight with your heel on the floor. Be sure to keep you back and feet straight. Hold this for about 30 seconds.\nSwitch legs and repeat.[35]",
                "Stretch your hamstrings. You can stretch your hamstring by lying on your back, and pulling your knees to your chest. If someone is available, they can help by gently putting additional pressure on your knees, forcing them a little closer to your chest. Be sure to avoid pressure on your abdomen.[36]",
                "Stretch your quadriceps muscle. Have a chair or wall nearby to steady yourself. Bend the knee of your cramped leg, and grab your foot. Pull your foot up towards your lower back and buttocks area.[37]",
                "Choose good footwear. Wear shoes that are comfortable and have good support in the back area of the shoe.[38]\n\nAccording to the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgery, your feet will grow about ½ size during pregnancy, and will likely remain at that size.[39]\n\nShoes recommended during pregnancy include those with good support all around, including adequate support in the heel area for your ankles.\nConsider purchasing athletic shoes to wear during your pregnancy.[40]\n\nTry to avoid wearing shoes with higher heels.[41]",
                "Drink plenty of fluids. Stay well hydrated during your pregnancy.\n\n\nTalk with your doctor about drinking beverages that contain electrolytes, such as sports drinks, if you are in your second or third trimester during the warmer months.[42]",
                "Contact a medical professional if your cramps persist. Muscle cramps that are severe, recurrent, last more than a few minutes, and are not relieved by stretching warrant medical attention.[43]",
                "Be prepared to answer your doctor’s questions. Your doctor will ask questions to help determine the cause of the cramps.[44]\n\nSome of the basic questions will include when the cramps started, how often they occur, how long they last, what muscles are involved, and any recent changes in your level of exercise.[45]\n\nYou may be asked to provide a list of your current medications, discuss your alcohol intake, and if you have had other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, or excessive amounts of urine.[46]\n\nMedications can cause changes in your body that may make you more susceptible to leg cramps. For example, some drugs used to treat high blood pressure can alter the way your body handles electrolytes and minerals.[47]\n\nYour doctor may draw blood to evaluate for underlying medical problems. Typical blood work done for muscle cramps include tests to evaluate your iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels, and how your body handles those substances. Other common tests include kidney function and thyroid function.[48]\n\nThe exam may also include steps to be sure you have good circulation in your legs.[49]",
                "See your doctor if you have other symptoms. If you have any leg swelling, redness, or changes in the skin around the area where you have the muscle cramps, you should see your doctor.[50]",
                "Talk to your doctor if you have a medical condition. Medical illnesses can put you at higher risk of leg cramps, especially if you alter your exercise routine.\n\n\nSome of these medical conditions include diabetes, liver problems, thyroid disease, obesity, or compressed nerves.[51]"
