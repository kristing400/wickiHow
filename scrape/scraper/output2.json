        "How to Measure Company Growth": {
            "intro": "Measuring company growth is necessary if you want to determine the success of any company, including your own. There are a number of ways in which you can measure the growth of a company, and no \"best way\" to do so. In order to get accurate results, you must implement consistent methods that evaluate all areas of the company, from internal factors to external. Consider the following steps if you want to measure company growth.",
            "steps": [
                "Lay out company objectives so that you can determine progress. If you have goals to meet, not only do you have something to strive for, but you have something to measure against. When setting your objectives for your company, don't set yourself up to fail. Be realistic about what you can achieve so that you can be successful at achieving it. In the same way, don't lower your expectations so that you can easily accomplish your objectives. Set objectives that are both realistic and challenging.\n\n\nGoals may include objectives like increasing market share or retaining more clients.[1]\n\nConsider splitting your goals into short term and long term goals, which refer to goals achievable in under a year and those achievable in over one year, respectively.\nA good way to check your goals is to make them conform to the acronym SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound).",
                "Put together a business plan so that you stay on track. Your business plan should reflect the objectives that you have for your company, as well as the methods you plan to apply in trying to achieve them. When measuring company growth, you will consult your business plan to not only see if you have managed to achieve objectives, but also confirm that you have successfully followed the plan that you set out for your business.\n\n\nIf necessary, put together additional methods to measure the growth variables that you have selected. These so-called key performance indicators (KPIs) can be measurements taken from financial statements, sales figures, or other sources that you think are necessary to assess the company's growth.[2]",
                "Hire an outside source to assist you in measuring company growth. This external service will come in and evaluate your current business. Having an outside consultant look at your organization can provide you with a fresh perspective that can identify problems you might have missed. Consultants are particularly useful for using accounting or statistical analysis to measure growth of specific business metrics. However, be aware that even the best statistical analysis sometimes overlooks basic managerial problems that can only be solved by the company's leadership.[3]",
                "Benchmark your company against competitors. Growth is important within your company, but measuring growth in comparison to competing businesses determines your success in the industry. If you improve your reputation in the marketplace, you will ultimately attract more clients and increase growth within the company.\n\n\nIf your competitors are publicly-traded companies, you will be able to find the figures you need in their annual reports, which by law must be posted on their websites.\nIn any case, you may be able to find what you need in press reports, trade publications, or media coverage regarding your competitors.[4]\n\nWhen calculating performance ratios, be sure to compare them to industry averages, provided you are able to find them. Try searching online for research in your industry.[5]",
                "Assess your customer base and determine whether that has increased. Not only are you looking for more customers, but you should be seeing better quality customers. Your customer base should be bringing in more profit. This means you are seeking to gain repeat customers and build customer loyalty.\n\n\nCustomer value is often measured as customer lifetime value (CLV). This figure is calculated by multiplying the average sale value by the number of repeat transactions and then multiplying that total by the average retention time of each customer.[6]\n\nThe result of the CLV calculation should be regularly recorded and businesses should seek to increase it often time.\nThis can be measured by customer surveys, purchase analysis, or by immediate feedback (\"is this your first time shopping with us?\"). Systems need to be implemented to measure these variables.[7]",
                "Compute revenue growth. Revenue growth is one of the simplest ways to measure company growth over a period of time. Typically, growth is measured using the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). This calculation is particularly useful for summarizing growth over longer time frames, like 5, 10, or 20 years.[8]\n\nThe CAGR equation is as follows: CAGR = final value divided by starting value times 1 over number of periods less 1 or (FV/SV)1/n-1.\nThe beginning value here would be revenue in the first year in the range being calculated and ending value would be revenue in the last.\nFor a longer explanation of how to calculate CAGR, see how to calculate compounded annual growth rate.",
                "Calculate workforce growth. Keep track of new hires for the year and compare them to previous years. A growing company should continue to hire new employees as it expands. You can also express this figure as a percentage by dividing the number of new hires in a year by the total number of employees at the beginning of that year.",
                "Find your market share growth. Market share is a company's portion of the total value of their given industry. It is calculated by dividing the company’s total revenues by the total revenues in an industry over a period of time by the company's revenue over the same period. This period can be a quarter, a year, or several years.\n\n\nGrowth can be determined by calculating the company's market share in several different periods and looking for growth or shrinkage in that company's share of the market.[9]\n\nFor example, if you are researching a company in a $1 billion market and that company had revenues of $150 million in 2014 (15 percent of the market) and $170 million in 2015 (17 percent of the market), their market share has increased 2 percent in the past year.",
                "Calculate the company's book value. The company's book value represents the difference between the company's assets and liabilities. In simpler terms, it represents the net value of all of the company's property, or what the company would be able to sell itself for if it were forced to liquidate quickly. To calculate book value, add up the company's assets, including current assets, fixed assets, and debts owed to the company, and then subtract liabilities, like unpaid bills and loan balances outstanding.[10]",
                "Measure market capitalization. For publicly traded companies (companies who sell stock to the public), market capitalization (market cap) is a measurement of the total value of the company's outstanding stock. It is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. Market cap is often used to measure a company's growth over time and is the most common indicator of a company's size used by financial professionals.[11]\n\nThe information needed to calculate market cap can be found in the company's annual report and on any stock-trading or stock market news website.\nFor more on market cap, see calculate the market value of a company.",
                "Find cash flow growth. Cash flows show how much actual money a company is earning. They are often used by financial professionals to determine the value of a company. This is done through the process of discounted cash flow analysis, in which future cash flows are extrapolated to determine a value for the company. Measure current cash flows against past cash flows to determine whether or not the business remains solvent.[12]\n\nDiscounted cash flow analysis involves projecting future free cash flows for an investment or company. These cash flows are then \"discounted\" back to the present at a set discount rate. This discount rate reflects the time value of money (reflects the idea that an amount of money today is worth more than that same amount of money in the future).\nThe discounted cash flows are then compared to the present cost of the investment to determine whether or not that investment is a good one.[13]",
                "Calculate the price/earnings (PE) ratio. For a publicly-traded company, the PE ratio represents the premium paid for the company's stock. That is, it is the current stock price divided by the average earnings per share over the last twelve months. A high result from this calculation means that investors expect that the company will increase in value in the future. Conversely, a low value may represent lower or negative growth expectations.[14]\n\nFor more on calculating the PE ratio, see how to calculate the PE ratio.",
                "Calculate gross margin growth. The gross margin is simply the difference between the company's revenue and its cost of goods sold (or cost of services provided). This represents how effectively the company is converting raw materials into finished products. Look for this metric to improve over time as the company streamlines its production process.[15]",
                "Find profit growth. Net profit, also called net income or simply profit, is the \"bottom line\" of the company. It measures the company's earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted from revenue. Profits are then used to either pay dividends or are reinvested in the company. Profits, like revenues, are often measured using the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). This allows companies to show their averaged profit growth over time, rather than focusing on individual years.[16]\n\nTo calculate CAGR for profits, see calculate CAGR.",
                "Evaluate your staff and consider their level of business growth. Compare staff levels, turnover and performance, and determine whether those areas have shown improvement. Assess whether or not increases in workforce have led to equivalent increases in productivity. This can be applied to any department. For examples, sales productivity is calculated as the company's revenue divided by the number of salespeople.[17]",
                "Analyze changes in your customer acquisition cost. The customer acquisition cost measures how much you have to spend on marketing and sales to earn the business of a new customer. This is found by dividing these costs (sales and marketing) by the number of new customers over a set period of time.\n\n\nA reduction in this cost is evidence that you are building a recognized brand. It also can show you if you are overspending on sales and marketing (if additional spending in these areas fails to bring a similar increase in new customers).[18]"

What things could you take along for activities and what activities could you do with the children? Working this out in advance will make the event much more enjoyable.\n\n\nBabysit according to age needs. The age of the child makes a huge difference.

            "intro": "Below are tips on how to live with autism or Asperger's Syndrome. People who live with Asperger's may be called \"Aspies\" or \"Aspergians\" and they are sometimes labeled as geeks, dorks, or nerds. Autistic people often experience problems with social interaction that neurotypicals (non-autistic people) take for granted. With patience, and the right help, anybody with Aspergers can succeed in this world.",
            "steps": [
                "Remember that autism is a neurological disability, not a disease. Every personality type has its positives and negatives. Autistic people are usually funny, insightful, detail-oriented, and moral. They may need help with social skills, anxiety management, choice making, and understanding unwritten social rules. Since autistic people are very diverse, it's difficult to generalize about their traits.",
                "Consider how to develop social skills. Therapies such as RDI can help you work on learning how to interact with neurotypicals.\n\n\nConversations in various social situations\nJob interview skills\nAsserting your needs and boundaries\nReading facial expressions\nDetermining whether someone is interested in talking",
                "Learn which specific aspects of Asperger's Syndrome give you the most trouble, and try to work around them.",
                "Learn how to handle sensory overload and meltdowns. These can be incredibly frustrating to deal with, and it's important to know how to stay feeling good. Don't stop at the wikiHow articles—look online to see what other autistic writers do in order to stay calm.",
                "Focus on your strengths. Being disabled doesn't make you a weak or lesser person—it's just one aspect of who you are. You can still find meaningful work, build worthwhile relationships, and make the world a better place. You are not broken.",
                "Practice independent living. For teens and young adults, as you get older, you need to take necessary steps so you can eventually live on your own.\n\n\nStart doing laundry, cleaning your room, and doing dishes. Ask your parents for help until you feel able to do it yourself.\nFind a program that teaches disabled people to drive.\nFind a job. Job assistance programs are available to help you.\nIf you are unable to take care of yourself, you can live in assisted living. Many intelligent and good people, like autistic writer Amy Sequenzia, live in some form of assisted living.",
                "Face your anxieties. Many autistic people face social anxiety (e.g. talking to groups or professors), generalized anxiety (e.g. fear of the future), or PTSD (e.g. from abusive therapists). Here are some tips to deal with anxiety.\n\n\nTalk to your therapist.\nTry facing your fears in little pieces. If you're afraid of talking to a guy you like, first smile at him in the hallway. Once you can handle that, try saying \"Hi\" or \"How are you?\" Remember that you're in control, and you can back out whenever you start to feel overwhelmed.\nAsk yourself: what's the worst thing that could happen? Is this realistic? How bad is it likely to get? Is it possible that your thinking is distorted?\nIf you're feeling bad about yourself, take the perspective of a friend. \"Would I be okay with my friend being told that she's a loser? Then should I say this to myself?\" \"Would I judge a friend for slipping up like that?\" If not, then you're fine.\n\nPractice habits that lower stress. Exercise is a good way to lower stress levels. Also make sure you are getting enough sleep, eat well, and limit how much caffeine you consume.",
                "Cultivate your special interests. They may turn into a fun, secure job someday. Furthermore, your colleagues will share your interests, so you can talk about your passion all the time!",
                "Remember to talk with people, not at them. A good ratio in a one-on-one conversation is to listen about 70% of the time and talk about 30%. Try not to talk for more than five to ten minutes at a time. Let the other person set the pace of the conversation.\n\n\nSometimes people are interested in monologues, because they want to learn more about your special interests. If they ask, it's okay to dive right in! Monitor their expression, and give pauses to allow them to react, so that you can adjust the subject or answer questions as need be.",
                "Know that eye contact is not a necessity. While most neurotypicals engage in it, it is perfectly fine not to do it if it makes you feel uncomfortable or distracted. Depending on what you can handle, try one of these:\n\n\nWatch their hands or feet. (Looking in their general direction suggests listening.)\nLook at their shirt, scarf, or necklace.\nObserve their chin, mouth, nose, hair, or forehead wrinkles.\nLook at their left eye briefly and then shift to their right eye.\nLook at the point between their eyes. Unless they're really close to you, it will appear to them that you are making eye contact.",
                "Learn how to read other people's behavior. This can be done by:\n\n\nWatching television shows and observing the faces\nLooking at art tutorials: what do angry faces look like? What do happy faces look like?\nAsking other autistic people for tips",
                "Listen with the intent to understand. Try to fully understand how the person feels before you explain your point of view. While this can be a difficult thing to do, people usually respond very well to it, and feel more opening to listen once they know that they're heard.\n\n\nAsk questions to clarify. \"She moved the deadline of the report?\"\nSummarize what they've said. \"So, you felt frustrated when your dad kept cutting you off like that.\" (It sounds silly, but it works!)\nAsk for their opinion. \"Did you think it was fair of the academy to do that?\"",
                "Ask before offering advice. Many autistic people experience a strong sense of social responsibility, or a desire to help out and fix problems. However, sometimes neurotypicals do not want advice—the best way you can help them is by listening. In this case, it is best to stave off the impulse to help, and allow them to be independent (for better or for worse).\n\n\n\"Were you looking for advice, or just someone to commiserate? Because that sounds like it stinks.\"\n\"Would you like some suggestions on how to deal with that?\"\n\"I went through a similar experience last fall. Let me know if you'd like any tips.\"",
                "Learn when it is appropriate to touch and approach people. Practice what you learned and try to follow the treatment plan recommendations.",
                "Practice validating others' feelings.[1][2] This practice can cause people to quickly trust and like you. Whether you agree with their actions or not, make it clear that you hear them and sympathize with their troubles. Acknowledge their feelings, rather than trying to one-up them, and your social skills will be better than those of plenty of neurotypicals.\n\n\n\"I'm really sorry to hear that. That sounds rough.\"",
                "Ask a professional for advice. Consult a psychologist, licensed social worker, occupational therapist, or a psychiatrist to learn more about autism/Asperger's Syndrome. As therapists, they may develop a treatment plan to assist with daily living.",
                "Network with other autistic people online. Autistic people usually use hashtags like #actuallyautistic and #askanautistic. You can share coping strategies, talk about your lives, and make friends who think in ways that you do.",
                "Form a team of people whose judgment you trust: parents, older siblings, relatives, therapists, close friends, et cetera. Whenever you feel uncertain, you can come to them for advice. Hearing a variety of perspectives will help you imagine possibilities so you can make the best decision.",
                "Join clubs or activities related to your special interest. This will give you a chance to make friends who share your passions, and the fun topic will make the outing less exhausting. Even if you don't talk to anyone there, you have a chance to practice something you love.\n\n\nDue to your intense focus and passion, you may even reach a leadership role! This will allow you to coach others (and will look great on your resume).",
                "Search wikiHow for articles on social skills and living. Here are several wikiHow articles that cover living with autism:\n\n\nHow to Balance Studying with an Autism Related Obsession\nHow to Avoid Meltdowns\nHow to Explain Autism to People\nHow to Fall Asleep if You're Autistic\nHow to Make Friends if You Have Asperger's Syndrome"

            "intro": "The \"department store method\" is the industry standard for folding shirts neatly. Perhaps you want to reorganize your dresser. Maybe you want to refold the shirts that you try on at the department store. The process is easy if you know the steps![1]",
            "steps": [
                "Lay out the shirt. Spread the shirt face-down on a flat, clean surface. Smooth out any wrinkles. Let the arms of the shirt lay naturally extended. If the shirt features buttons or a zipper: button all buttons, and zip the zipper shut completely before you begin folding. [2]\n\nIf the shirt has a hood: fold this bit down first. Lay the hood down flat against the back of the shirt before folding the sleeves inward.\nTry placing a clean, crisp magazine on the back of the shirt as a guide for a neater fold. Squarely center the magazine right below the collar. Then, make your folds in line with the edges of the magazine.[3]",
                "Fold one sleeve of the shirt. First, pinch the top of the shirt on either side of the collar. Hold the fabric tight so that you don't create any unwanted creases. Then, take the sleeve on the same side that you're holding the collar. Fold the sleeve and any extra fabric across the center crease of the shirt. Make a straight line from top to bottom on the folded side.",
                "Fold the other sleeve. Repeat the fold for the sleeve that you haven't creased yet. For the sake of presentation, try to make the second fold symmetrical with the first. Don't be afraid to adjust the sleeves a bit so that they match one another.[4]",
                "Fold one side of the shirt to the center. The edge of the shirt should extend almost exactly halfway across the back of the shirt. Firmly crease the edge so that it forms a perfect vertical line down the back of the garment.\n\nIf the shirt has long sleeves: fold them back in on themselves so that they run lengthwise down the back of the shirt.\nIf the shirt has short sleeves: fold them so that they fit neatly and symmetrically into the back of the shirt.",
                "Bring the other side to the center. Fold the other edge of the shirt over to meet the first edge in the middle of the back. Make sure that the two edges run parallel, and that they do not overlap.\n\nIf you are using a magazine to make the fold more precise: fold each side of the shirt until it hits the magazine. Simply fold the shirt to the width of a magazine.",
                "Crease the shirt in half. Fold up the bottom edge of the shirt so that it meets the top of the shoulders. Let the edge rest just below the collar. Smooth out any creases, and make sure that the fold is symmetrically all the way across the width of the shirt.",
                "Flip the shirt over to finish. Make sure that all the edges are straight and crisp. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles in the fabric, and check that the shirt is ready for sale. In department stores, the shirt is always displayed with the front facing up. [5]\n\nIf you are folding your shirt for convenient home storage, then it is doesn't matter so much which way you display the garment. It may still be convenient to keep your shirts front-side up so that you can easily tell which is which."

            "intro": "The Irish language, Irish Gaelic, or Gaeilge is a Celtic Indo-European language, closely related to Scottish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic, and more distantly related to Welsh, Breton, and Cornish. Whilst up to 1.5 million Irish people claim to understand Irish, in reality, Irish is a minority language. Irish is spoken daily and as a mother tongue by between 10,000 and 50,000 people, primarily in pockets along Ireland's west coast known as Gaeltachtaí. Few people in Ireland today exclusively speak only Irish, most speakers are bilingual or multilingual with English and other languages.",
            "steps": [
                "\"Haileo\" is the simplest way of saying 'hello', but it is very rarely used.",
                "\"Dia duit!\" is the most traditional way of greeting someone. It's pronounced \"dee a gwitch\". It translates to God be with you, lit. God to you.\n\n\nIf there's just one person say \"Dia duit\" but, for two or more, say \"Dia daoibh\". Duit is singular, daoibh is plural.\nRespond with \"Dia's Muire duit/daoibh\". This means God and Mary be with you.\nExtra marks if you can reply with \"Dia's Muire's Pádraig duit/daoibh\". Pádraig is the Irish for Patrick; St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.\nIt may be of interest to note the spelling of 'Muire' in this phrase. If your name is Mary, it translates to Maire, not Muire. However the mother of God's name is spelled Muire. This is because in Irish there are reverend and common versions of some names. For example, Uncle John would be (Uncail) Seán but St. John would be (Naomh) Eoin.",
                "\"Fáilte romhat\" means welcome.\n\n\n'Cead mile fáilte romhat' is a beautiful phrase, meaning a hundred thousand welcomes to you.\n'Failte Ui Cheallaigh' is literally Kelly's welcome. It has come to mean the welcome of all welcomes. This phrase has a fascinating origin and is connected to a beautiful poem which you will find if you google the phrase.\nThe plural of romhat is romhaibh.",
                "Seanfocail (sheanucc-all), meaning old phrases, are Irish proverbs which contain all the wit and wisdom of the Irish people. They are commonly thrown into Irish conversation. Once you've mastered the basics they're a great way to add richness to the language and the vocabulary you pick up is always useful!\n\n\n\"Is fearr an tsláinte ná na táinte\". Health is better than wealth.\n\"Is ait an mac an saol\". Life is a strange thing. Such is life.\n\"Aithníonn ciaróg ciaróg eile\". One beetle recognises another. Birds of a feather flock together.\n\"Cuir síoda ar ghabhar agus is gabhar i gcónaí é\". Dress a goat in silk and he'll still be a goat.\n\"Ní thagann ciall roimh aois\". Sense doesn't come before age.\n\"Níl saoi gan locht na daoi gan tréith\". There's no wise man without a fault nor fool without a talent.\nEmigration: \"Bíonn súil le mir ach ní bhíonn súil le tír\". There's hope from the sea but there's no hope from the land (grave).\n\"Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam\". A country without a language (tongue), a country without a soul. See who can spot this phrase first in the tourist shops or on bumper stickers!\n\"Trí ní is deacair a thuiscint: intealacht na mbean, obair na mbeach agus imeacht na taoide\". The three hardest things to understand; a woman's mind, the work of the bees and the ways of the tide.\n\"Níl aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin\". There's no hearth like your own hearth/there's no place like home. One of the most popular Irish proverbs.\nwww.daltai.com/proverbs is a fantastic resource which explains the tradition behind many of the seanfocail. http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaeilge/corpus/seanfhocail/seanfhocail.html contains a wealth of information.",
                "\"Conas atá tu?\", pronounced \"cunis at-aw thwo\". This simply means \"How are you?\".\n\n\n\"Táim go maith\" (tahw-im go-my)- I'm good.\n\"Tá athás orm/ Táim athásach\". The first phrase is much more common and translates to 'There's happiness upon me'. The second is closer to its English equivalent, meaning 'I'm happy'.\n\"Táim ceart go leor\": I'm fine or, as the Irish say, I'm grand.\n\"Níl caill orm\": Not a bother on me.\n\"Ar bharr na gceirtlíní gealaí\": 'On top of the bright waves', similar to 'On top of the world'.\n\"Nilím go maith\": I'm not good.\n\"Tá bron orm/ Táim bronach\": There's sadness upon me/I'm sad.\n\"Ta me tinn,\" means I am sick; it's pronounced \" Ta may chinn.\"",
                "\"Go raibh maith agat\" (go row (as in argue) my ag-ut) means thank you. It literally translates into the far nicer 'There was goodness with you'. Awh shucks.\n\n\n\"Tá fáilte romhat\" means 'You're welcome'.\n\"Ná abair é\" means \"Don't mention it\", a far more common response. The Irish do have a name for being bad at taking compliments!",
                "\"Nollaig shona duit/daoibh\", pronounced \"nollig huna ditch/dweeve\", means 'Happy Christmas to you'.\n\n\n\"Go n-éirí an t-ádh leat\" meaning safe journey or good luck. It is pronounced \"go nyree on thaaw laath.\nWhen saying goodbye \"slán go fóill\" pronounced \"slaaun goh fole\"",
                "There is not a cloud in the sky is spelt \"nil scamaill sa speir,\" but is pronounced \" kneel skamall sa spare.\"",

Some community colleges have certification programs in floral design, but there is no requirement for college credits in order to work as a florist.[1]\n\nWorking for a florist while you attend college is a good way to get the most out of your training.\nIf the florist doesn't have any jobs or internships arranging flowers, you should consider doing part-time work cleaning the shop or other unskilled tasks in order to get a sense of the way a shop works.",
                "Consider on-the-job training. Working for a florist is the most efficient way to learn what skills you'll need, because you'll learn first-hand the pressures and rewards of owning your own shop. In addition, you'll likely learn cost-saving measures and floral design secrets that won't be found in community college programs.\n\n\nSomeone who works in floral design is usually more up-to-date on the latest trends in the flower industry as opposed to someone whose involvement has been more academic.\nIf you plan to open your flower shop in the same city, county or state, you'll learn more about local resources and licensing requirements. While there are no formal requirements for becoming a florist, you'll need to apply for a business license and follow all local tax and building codes.",
                "Think about risks and benefits of opening a flower shop. Someone who runs his own flower shop will have to expect to work from quite early in the morning, as early as 4:30 a.m., until the end of a typical business day, 5:00-5:30. Your shop will likely be open at least 6 days per week.\n\n\nYou'll have to be plan ahead for busy seasons (generally around Valentine's Day and Mother's Day) and slow seasons (January and August tend to be slow seasons for the floral industry).\nIf you're thinking of hiring any employees, you'll need to make sure they're well trained. Customer service is essential in running a successful flower shop.",
                "Define your business's mission. Most people write a business plan in order to apply for a loan, but even if you don't intend to apply for a loan, a business plan can be helpful. The more clear you are about your business's mission, the more accurately you may be able to target your marketing, inventory, and design.[2]\n\nA sample business mission statement might read: \"Mary's Farm Flowers will work with local farms to employ workers with disabilities to create floral arrangements for the Sailway Community. 10% of all proceeds will be returned to local charity organizations to support residential programs for disabled adults.\"\nAnother example of a mission statement might read: \"Shazam Flowers And More provides delivery service to your home, work, or corporate function in the Tri-City Metro region within one hour of request.\"",
                "Decide what sort of business structure will be best. Most new flower shops opt for a sole-proprietorship business structure, as this is the simplest structure. A sole-proprietorship business structure means that all decisions and responsibilities are those of a single person. Other options include:[3]\n\nLimited-Liability Partnership: A limited partnership is made up of one or more partners with unlimited liability for all debts incurred by the partnership, and one or more limited partners whose liability is limited to the extent of his or her capital contribution. The advantages of forming a partnership is that it is fairly easy to set up, and each partner bears a certain portion of both the risks and the profits. The disadvantage is that all partners must agree upon all business decisions, and sharing the liability and profits may result in disagreement at times.\nA Limited-Liability Corporation (LLC): A Limited Liability Company is an unincorporated business organization run by one or more business partners, called partners, each of whom has limited liability for the contractual obligations and other liabilities of the business. This business structure is more flexible than either the corporation or the nonprofit model. The advantages of an LLC is that it prevents any individual member/owner from bearing the financial risks of the company. The disadvantages are that, in many states, the LLC is dissolved when any individual member leaves.\nA Corporation: A corporation, sometimes called a c-corporation, is an business that is separate and distinct from the individual(s) who own and manage the business. This is a complex business structure that is best suited for a large, established business with multiple employees. Corporations have some tax advantages, and potential employees may look favorably on the corporate structure. However, for someone just opening a flower shop, the paperwork necessary for starting up a corporation are time-consuming and costly.\nAn S-Corp: To register as an s-corp, you must first qualify as a corporation. Once you are established as a corporation, you may decide to transfer your structure to that of an s-corp. This business structure is not recommended for someone starting up a flower shop, although a large and established flower company may elect to use this structure.",
                "Do market research. Who will your likely customers be? What are their habits of flower-buying, and what are they most likely to purchase? Consider as much information as you possibly can regarding your customers (market).[4]\n\nThings to think about include knowing what role flowers are likely to play in the lives of your customers. Are they likely to purchase flowers for people who are sick or dying? Or are flowers an important part of community events/celebrations/birthdays?\nThink about what businesses are in your community and what role flower may have in their operation. For example, do industry leaders in your community regularly include floral arrangements in their lobbies or conferences? Is your area one in which \"destination\" weddings take place? Do company leaders present flowers to their employees?\nFind out how much different businesses budget for flowers in their companies, and know how much they're likely to spend for a typical floral arrangement.",
                "Know your competitors. Competition for your new flower shop includes all flower-selling retail establishments in the area, including both locally-owned flower shops, farm flower operations, as well as large retail shops, \"big box\" stores, home-and-garden centers, grocery stores, etc.\n\n\nIncreasingly, flower sales are being offered by online establishments, both large and small. Include online floral sales in your research.[5]\n\nConsider the ways that your competitors are reaching their target markets, and think about ways you can either reach different consumers, or compete directly with the existing stores. You might think about the ways the current flower stores aren't meeting the needs of the local market base, and try to find a way to meet those needs.",
                "Decide if you will have a storefront. If your research determines that people in your area are likely to purchase flowers online, you may not need to invest in a storefront. The benefit to this is that you won't have to depend on paying for real estate in popular shopping areas, or hiring a full-time store manager. You'll be free to make deliveries, pick up inventory, etc.[6]\n\nThe disadvantages are that you'll still have to pay for a location to store and arrange your flowers, even if you are selling online.\nIt may be more difficult to attract customers through a purely online store presence.\nIf you choose to rent a storefront, you'll do best to find a location with high visibility, good parking, and plenty of walk-in traffic. This means that your rent may be expensive.",
                "Make sure there is some way to control temperatures in your location. No matter where you store is, you'll need to be able to store your flower inventory at a fixed temperature. If your temperature is too high or lower, your flowers may wilt or shrivel. You won't be able to sell them.[7]\n\nThe optimal temperature to store most flowers is 34 to 36 °F (1.1 to 2.2 °C) (40 degrees maximum)\nSome flowers do best at 30 °F (−1.1 °C), and will not freeze at these temperatures.\nFlowers keep best in high humidity. Relative humidity should be no lower than 80% and is best kept between 90%-95% humidity.\nTropical flowers should be stored at 55-60 degrees. Cooler temperatures may damage them.[8]",
                "Take out a loan if you need to. Start up costs vary considerably, depending on factors such as renting a location, investing in refrigerators for your inventory, marketing fees, insurance, etc. You'll need vases, pruning equipment, ribbons and other supplies.[9]\n\nExperts recommend budgeting at least 2-3 times your purchase price for the first year you're in operation.\nConsider talking with the SBA-supported free organization SCORE, which is a volunteer organization comprised of retired business executives who can help you determine your business needs.[10]",
                "Decide if you'll be a member of a wire service. Most flower shop owners decide to pay a monthly membership fee in exchange for receiving orders through the flower service, such as FTD, Teleflora and BloomNet. These orders can come from anywhere in the country, and may even be ordered internationally. For example, a customer can walk into a flower shop in Brooklyn and order a flower arrangement to be delivered in Los Angeles through FTD. Both flower shop owners (the one who takes the initial order, and the one who delivers it) receive a portion of the sales.[11]\n\nWhile this may bring in additional sales, the percentage of each sale (as much as 27%) paid out to the wire service means less profit for the small shop owner.\nThere may be an initial start-up fee as well, depending on the service you choose to work with.",
                "Apply for any necessary licenses. Most municipalities require that flower shops have a business license. You may also need to apply for a resale license (also called a reseller's certificate) because you'll be charging sales tax on the resale of your inventory. Check with your local state and city business offices.\n\n\nFor example, in the state of North Carolina, a flower shop will need to have a license through the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\nIn Wisconsin, you must apply for a seller's permit through the Wisconsin Department of Revenue."

        "wikiHow to Know if You Have a Learning Disability": {
            "intro": "Learning disabilities are neurological-based problems that affect how the brain processes information, making it quite difficult or impossible to learn certain skills, i.e., reading, writing, arithmetic.[1] While many people are diagnosed during their childhood and begin to receive therapy while attending school, a great deal of others, unfortunately, slip through the cracks and are never diagnosed. This guide will help you determine if either you or your child have a learning disability (LD). It will also provide information on the screening and diagnostic process.[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Understand that there are many types of learning disabilities. Each of these disabilities affects an individual in different ways and can produce different types of symptoms. LDs can affect the way the brain processes audio, visual, or speech-related information or stimuli.\n\n\nLDs are the result of neurological-based problems that affect the way that the brain receives, processes, stores, and responds to information: the brain's cognitive functioning.\nLDs are not curable, they are lifelong. But, they can be managed with the proper help.",
                "Know the most common LDs. One in every five Americans is diagnosed with a LD. Unfortunately, because each LD affects the cognitive area of the brain, symptoms tend to over-lap, making it quite difficult for even the trained professional to identify. For example, poor-handwriting skills can be the result of difficulties processing symbols (dyslexia); or from poor spatial organization skills (dysgraphia). The most common LDs are:\n\n\nDyslexia is a reading disability that affects how one interprets sounds, letters and words.[3] It can affect general vocabulary skills as well as one's reading speed and efficiency. Symptoms of dyslexia include late speech, difficulty with handwriting, and difficulty rhyming words.\nDyscalculia affects an individual's ability to process numbers, and can manifest itself as a problem with memorization skills, as well as a difficulty sequencing patterns or numbers.[4] Symptoms of dyscalculia include difficulty counting and memorizing arithmetic concepts.\nDysgraphia is a LD of writing, and can be the result of either a physical motor in-efficiency, or a mental difficulty in understanding and processing certain forms of information.[5] Individuals with dysgraphia tend to demonstrate poor handwriting skills, illegible and/or irregular writing, and have difficulties communicating through the written form.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the general symptoms of a learning disability. Although each LD affects the brain in a different way, there are, however, general symptoms that can help indicate whether-or-not an individual has a disability of either the audio, visual, or speech type. These symptoms include:[6]\n\nTrouble spelling.\nAvoidance of reading and writing.\nDifficulty summarizing.\nTrouble with open-ended questions.\nPoor memory.\nDifficulty with abstract concepts.\nTrouble expressing ideas.\nMispronunciation.\nEasily distracted.\nMix up right/left or poor sense of direction.\nTrouble following directions or completing tasks.[7]",
                "Observe daily patterns and routines. Take well-detailed notes if necessary, and look for the most obvious symptoms of a LD--poor memorization, bad social skills, frustration with reading and/or writing.\n\n\nDo you or your child perform daily tasks in a different way each time? This can be an indicator of a LD.[8]\n\nDo this over an extended period of time.",
                "Consider the alternative causes. These symptoms may not necessarily be the result of a LD, but may be caused by other conditions affecting you or your child. In many cases, individuals demonstrate the symptoms of a LD but do not actually have any disorder. Instead, these individuals are being affected by social, financial, personal, or general living conditions that make it difficult to learn or remain focused.[9]\n\nThese \"learning problems\" are not considered disorders.[10]\n\nIt is very difficult to distinguish between learning disorders and learning problems.",
                "Take a quiz. If you do not believe that the symptoms are being caused by any outside or social conditions, then the next step is to take a quiz or questionnaire. Many are available online. These tests will help you assess whether-or-not you should seek any further screening.\n\n\n\nHere is a test that you can take at home.",
                "Understand that having a LD does not mean that a person is in any way unintelligent or incapable. On the contrary, individuals with LDs typically demonstrate an average to above average intelligence.[11] Charles Schwab and Whoopi Goldberg have been diagnosed with LDs, and many suspect that Albert Einstein may have had one as well.\n\n\nCelebrities Tom Cruise, Danny Glover and Jay Leno all have dyslexia, and have actively campaigned to raise awareness for the disability.\nHistorians and researchers suspect that these historical figures may have also had some form of learning disability: George Patton, Walt Disney, Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon Bonaparte.",
                "Consult your personal medical physician. If you demonstrate symptoms or suspect that you may have a LD, the first step toward seeking help is to contact your personal doctor. Your physician will discuss your options with you, and more specifically, look for any further symptoms.[12] If necessary, your physician can point you in the proper direction for further screening.\n\n\nThis is not a diagnosis, but rather, only the first step of several that are required to be properly diagnosed.\nBeing properly diagnosed includes initial consultation, screening, and then final diagnosis.",
                "Get screened for a LD. Screening is an informal process that takes place between you and a LD advocate. After you have been screened, your advocate will inform you whether-or-not you should pursue further diagnosis.\n\n\nScreening is relatively inexpensive.\nIt consists of observation, an interview, and brief testing.[13]\n\nMental health clinics and state rehabilitation agencies can provide initial consultation.[14]\n\nMental health clinics and local universities often times provide assessments that are priced on a sliding scale.[15]",
                "Be formally evaluated by a qualified professional. This does not necessarily mean your medical physician--most general practitioners are not licensed to diagnose LDs--but instead, a clinical or neurological psychologist.[16]\n\nAfter your advocate is finished evaluating all of the information, you will need to meet with him or her again in order to discuss the results.",
                "Return for consultation. During this meeting your advocate will diagnose and provide you with a written report that details your specific LD. This report will provide learning specialists with the information that they need to provide you with any further help.\n\n\nThis report can also be used to make a request for special accommodations at school or work.",
                "Ask questions. When you return to discuss the results of your evaluation, be sure to ask your advocate about anything that is unclear to you. [17]\n\nAre there any terms that you do not understand?\nAre you unclear as to what to do next? Or what your advocate expects?",
                "Contact your son or daughter's teacher. Let them know about your concerns. The teacher, or another professional, will begin collecting information about your child's scholastic performance.[18]\n\nOnce enough information has been collected, the teacher or learning specialist will provide your son or daughter with a series of learning strategies or supplemental learning activities.\nA school cannot collect information about your son or daughter without your written consent.[19]",
                "Review the learning strategies and activities provided by your learning specialist. Make sure that your son or daughter's weaknesses are actually being addressed in the supplemental learning plan that has been provided by the specialist.\n\n\nDo the expectations of the learning plan accurately address your son or daughter's needs?",
                "Follow the routine provided by your learning specialist. These routines are designed to help your son or daughter become a more-effective student. Furthermore, this routine will help learning specialist more accurately diagnose a specific type or kind of LD. Like any exercise, however, these activities will only work if they are followed exactly as planned.\n\n\nNo further action is usually taken if these learning plans produce positive results.[20]",
                "Seek formal evaluation. The \"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\" ensures free-screening for your child. So, if your son or daughter does not show any significant improvement from the activities that have been provided by your learning specialist, then you should have your son or daughter formally evaluated.\n\n\nYour son or daughter's teacher will be able to provide you with more information regarding the process.\nFormal screening will include a series of tests and interviews.\nThe committee may suggest special education.",
                "Obtain an \"Individualized Education Program.\" After the committee has finished evaluating all of the information, you will meet with them to create an \"Individualized Education Program\" for your son or daughter. This program will outline the learning objectives for your child, and will also provide you with information regarding the services that your school or school district offers.[21]\n\nYou have the right to be part of this process!\nIf you have specific learning goals for your child, they should be discussed at the post-evaluation meeting.",
                "Follow the \"Individualized Education Program.\" Depending on the specific learning goals and LD, it may take quite some time to see any significant improvement from your child.\n\n\nThe \"Individualized Education Program\" may have a timeline of development. This is only a guide, not an exact rule.",
                "Contact the school district if you believe that the program is not working. You have the right to have your son or daughter re-evaluated if the \"Individualized Education Program\" that you received is not producing significant results.[22]\n\nLDs are very difficult to diagnose, which means that re-evaluations are not uncommon.\nBecause symptoms tend to over-lap, even highly-trained experts can misdiagnose a specific type or kind of LD."

            "steps": [
                "Think about what made you enemies. This might be a painful set of memories to relive, but it is necessary to consider them in order to change your thinking. What role did you play in your rift? How long have you had bad blood between you?[2]\n\nRemembering these things will help you to eventually make peace with your enemies.",
                "Have reasonable expectations. When you hear the phrase \"love your enemies,\" this doesn't mean you have to love them in the same way you love your friends or family, but you should be able to love them as your equal, in the same way the Bible verse suggests that God gives His goodness equally to everyone.\n\n[3]\nUnderstand if you need more time. If your enemy has hurt you very deeply -- such as a friend who had an affair with your spouse or a co-worker who has sabotaged a professional opportunity for you -- then it might take a lot of time before you can try to forgive them.[4]",
                "Accept that you won't get an apology. You might believe that in order to truly forgive your enemies, they will have to apologize for their wrongs against you. But this gives your enemy a large amount of power. Realize that forgiveness and loving your enemy is more about benefiting yourself than them.\n\n[5]",
                "Learn the health benefits of forgiveness. When you forgive someone, you can experience things such as lower blood pressure, improved symptoms if you suffer from anxiety or depression, and even a boost in your immune system.\n\n[6]\nLetting go of bitterness can also have enormous benefits for your mental well being, giving you higher self-esteem and improving your psychological welfare.[7]",
                "Make forgiveness a choice. Every time you feel yourself thinking bitter or resentful thoughts towards your enemy, stop yourself and think about something positive instead. Think about how you have grown from your experiences with your enemy instead of how angry you still are with them.\n\n[8]\nRemember that when you indulge in resentful thoughts toward your enemy, you keep yourself in the position of a victim. You continue to allow them to have power over your thoughts. If you can't love them at first, then try to at least ignore them or think of them in a neutral light.[9]",
                "Express empathy for your enemy. Although you may have been hurt by them in the past, try to see the world through their perspective. What kinds of past experiences may have shaped their behavior? Are they going through something that you don't know about?[10]",
                "Recognize your own faults. Think of times that you have said something hurtful or inappropriate. Would you want forgiveness in a similar situation?\n\n[11]\nWhen have you been forgiven in the past? How did that person express their sense of empathy or compassion toward you?",
                "Keep track of your thoughts. If you find yourself becoming resentful, write down your feelings in a journal or meditation book. If you are religious, you might consider praying out loud so you can hear your thoughts clearly.\n\n[12]",
                "Reconsider your relationship with your enemy. If your enemy is someone who you must spend every day with (like a co-worker), then try to view every interaction you have with them as an opportunity to mend the rift between you. Be kind and patient with them and express an interest in the developments in their life.\n\n\nIf you are not interested in reconciling with your enemy, then at least try to look at your interactions as a way to maintain a basic level of respect with them. Be courteous in you interactions with them -- greet them when you see them and congratulate them when they have major milestones.[13]",
                "Volunteer for a cause. If you have suffered a major trauma, such as the murder of a family member, you might find it easier to find peace by volunteering for a bigger cause, such as victim advocacy groups.\n\n\nThis experience will also connect you to other people who have been hurt in similar ways. It will give you a community you can turn to for support.[14]",
                "Cultivate healthy friendships. Sometimes, the best way to love your enemy is to focus your energy on more positive relationships. If there is someone you've wanted to get to know better, ask them out for a cup of coffee or to get a drink after work.\n\n[15]\nYou can also join groups and meet people who share similar interests to you, like hiking groups, photography clubs or writing workshops. Search for groups that meet in your local community centers, libraries or universities.",
                "Take advantage of counseling. If you find yourself having trouble trusting new friends, seeking counseling from a therapist to help you develop trust and learn how to heal from a betrayal.\n\n[16]\nA therapist can also give you strategies for navigating the process of forgiveness and moving on from the pain of your interactions with your enemy."

        "How to Overcome Extreme Fatigue During Menstruation": {
            "intro": "Menstruation is a normal bodily function that occurs every month for women once they reach puberty until they go through menopause. Many women experience fatigue during menstruation — the level of fatigue varies from woman to woman. While there is a tendency to blame fatigue on hormones, there is no data to support this claim, and it is unclear why women feel fatigue during this time. Despite this, you can still treat fatigue by adjusting your diet, making lifestyle changes, and addressing any underlying health problems with your doctor.",
            "steps": [
                "Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. When you eat small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals each day, you should be able to maintain a high energy level. Going too long without eating can decrease your energy levels, making it important to eat small, healthy snacks between meals.[1]\n\nWhen you eat a large meal, your body puts more energy towards digesting the food, which in turn can make you tired.",
                "Eat more protein to boost your energy levels. Proteins help to create enzymes and hormones that keep you from feeling as fatigued. Eating lean proteins can also help to keep your blood sugar levels balanced so that you don’t experience a peak (and subsequent crash) that could heighten your fatigue.[2] Foods that are considered to be good sources of protein include:\n\n\nPoultry like chicken, duck, and turkey.\nLean cuts of beef, ham and pork.\nSeafood like salmon, tuna, trout, and cod.\nBeans, peas, and processed soy products.\nNuts and seeds like almonds or sunflower seeds.",
                "Eat fewer carbohydrates and sugars. In your everyday diet, avoid eating carbohydrates and sugars and spiking your blood sugar.[3] Researchers have linked the symptoms of PMS with low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. Although it would seem that you should eat more sugar and carbohydrates to raise your sugar level, it actually has the opposite effect. Within two hours your sugar level has plummeted again after insulin has metabolized all the glucose in your bloodstream.\n\n\nOften times women reach for comfort foods during their periods. Things like mac 'n cheese or a slice of cake may strike you as exactly what you need to help you feel better when you have your period, but it actually works against you by making you feel more tired. Do your best to resist cravings and comfort foods and reach for healthy snacks instead.\nInstead, it is important to eat foods that are high in healthy fats, which will stabilize your blood sugar and protect your heart from heart disease and stroke.[4]\n\nThese are not trans-fats found in baked goods, which are the worst type of fat that you can eat.[5] The baked goods are also high in carbohydrates, which spike your blood sugar.\nTry eating complex carbs (like whole grain bread or a baked potato), a tablespoon of almond butter, low-fat string cheese, an apple or pear, or a handful of nuts when cravings strike.",
                "Prevent anemia. Sometimes a combination of blood loss and poor nutrition can lead to iron deficiency anemia, which contributes significantly to extreme fatigue. Women who have fibroid growths in the uterus, which lead to greater blood loss during menstruation, or those who have poor nutritional habits can experience anemia.[6]\n\nIron-rich foods, such as beef, dark green leafy vegetables, beans, and lentils will help prevent anemia from poor nutrition.\nSee your physician if changes you make at home do not improve your symptoms or if you believe that your periods have gotten heavier over time. Up to 10% of women under 49 are anemic. Long-term effects of anemia can include negative effects on the heart muscle and increase the risk of cardiac conditions.[7]",
                "Exercise. Exercise will help reduce feelings of fatigue.[8] Although it may seem counterintuitive to expend energy when you feel fatigued, exercise can help reduce many of the symptoms of PMS, including fatigue. Getting regular aerobic exercise 30 minutes four to six times each week will help to balance your hormones, improve your lipid profiles, reduce your risk of heart disease, and improve your overall health.\n\n\nExercise also helps to reduce stress levels and improve the quality of your sleep. Being physically active will reduce cramps and help you manage the psychological effects of PMS as well as boosting your body’s natural production of endorphins, a natural antidepressant.[9]\n\nIncreasing the amount of exercise you get during the premenstrual and menstrual period of time can help promote more deep-sleep stages that are restorative and reduce fatigue.",
                "Lose weight. Obesity is one risk factor for suffering from premenstrual syndrome, including extreme fatigue. One study interviewing over 870 women found that those who had a BMI (Body Mass Index) over 30, which indicates obesity, had a three-fold increased risk of suffering from symptoms of PMS.[10]\n\nObesity, although difficult, is a modifiable risk factor. This means that although a challenge, you can reduce your risk by losing weight.\nBy following a balanced diet that is high in healthy fats and low in carbohydrates, as well as including 30 minutes of exercise, you can lower the risk of fatigue.",
                "Hydrate yourself. Dehydration can cause you to feel fatigued, so you need to keep hydrated. Drink at least 64 ounces (2 liters) of water each day and eat foods that are also high in water content, such as vegetables.\n\n\nAlthough it can seem counterintuitive, the more water you drink, the less water you retain. Water retention and bloating can contribute to your mental and emotional health, which can affect your fatigue.[11]",
                "Drink less alcohol. Avoid alcohol, especially when you are close to your period. Alcohol is a natural depressant, which increases feelings of fatigue.\n\nAvoid alcohol altogether during premenstrual time periods as your progesterone levels are higher between ovulation and menstruation. These high progesterone levels can exacerbate the effects of alcohol, or make the already depressant effects of alcohol worse, thus increasing your experience of fatigue. [12]\n\nTest the beverages you would like to include in your diet and chart the effects on your level of fatigue.[13]",
                "Get enough sleep. Get between seven to nine hours of sleep each night.[14] Research has determined that these are the hours needed to reduce fatigue, improve health, and increase productivity.\n\n\nHowever, PMS can cause sleep disturbances which contribute to feelings of fatigue.[15] These sleep issues are related to the fluctuating estrogen levels in the body during menstruation.\nIf you have a hard time sleeping when you are premenstrual and menstruating, practice stress reduction strategies to improve the quality of sleep you get.[16] Strategies can include deep breathing exercises, listening to calming music, learning to laugh each day, watching comedy shows, taking a walk outside in the sunshine, and talking with close friends and relatives.[17]",
                "Take a multivitamin. Your body requires a balanced diet to support optimal functioning. Unfortunately, most of us don’t eat a diet complete with all of the vitamins and minerals necessary. To make sure you get enough, take a high-quality multivitamin each day to help reduce your overall health risk and support bodily functions.[18]\n\nAsk your doctor, pharmacist, or nutritionist for recommendations about which brand of vitamin to take. Not all multivitamins are the same, and because they are not regulated by the FDA, you want to make sure you are buying a brand you can trust.",
                "Consider additional supplementation. Multivitamins will help balance your vitamin intake, in order to reduce the effects of fatigue during menstruation. Although you may be taking a multivitamin, it may not meet all your requirements, depending upon your nutritional plan. It can be difficult to ensure you receive enough of all the right vitamins every day.\n\n\n200 mg of magnesium daily has been shown to reduce symptoms of PMS and fluid retention.[19]\n\nThe addition of vitamin B6 with magnesium reduced the severity of symptoms of PMS, including fatigue, in a study performed on over 150 women.[20]\n\nTake 1200 mg of calcium carbonate each day. In studies of women between 18 and 45 years of age, this dose of calcium carbonate supplement was found to decrease symptoms of PMS, including fatigue.[21]\n\nIn other studies, the use of L-tryptophan was demonstrated to reduce the effects of PMDD, including fatigue, in women.[22] However, L-tryptophan is not used without some risk. Side effects can include blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, head twitching, hives, nausea, sweating and tremors. Do not add l-tryptophan to your treatment regimen or supplementation until you discuss your individual medical condition with your physician.[23]",
                "Take birth control pills. Birth control pills can help reduce the effects of PMS and extreme fatigue by modulating the hormonal levels in your body during your menstrual cycle. Use the pill for three to four months to determine if it will have the effect you desire.\n\n\nThe pill will also lighten your period, help clear your skin and can reduce your risk of ovarian cancer. [24]",
                "Learn about menstruation. Menstruation is controlled by hormones, which are released from both the pituitary gland and the ovaries. This process prepares the uterus to accept a fertilized egg and grow the child for nine months. Some women can suffer from more symptoms of fatigue and discomfort during the time period immediately prior to and in the first days of menstruation.[25]",
                "Recognize normal menstruation fatigue. Some fatigue during your period is normal so it is important to plan your life around this very normal part of being a woman; however, while some fatigue is normal, extreme fatigue is not. That feeling that you have to take a nap can seem overwhelming. You may not have the energy to go out with friends and your fatigue may interfere with work or your social life.\n\n\nThese symptoms can be a part of both premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).[26][27] Note, too, that these are both premenstrual, so they should generally be resolved when you actually begin menstruating. If your extreme fatigue continues during menstruation or starts when you begin menstruating, then it is likely caused by something else.",
                "Look for extreme symptoms. If you have a difficult time dragging yourself to work in the week before and during your period, don’t go out with friends or find that you can do nothing more than sit on the couch for three days a month, it’s time to take other measures to address what is now extreme fatigue. Your first step is to determine if the fatigue you experience is related to your menstrual period. This will help you to plan a strategy which can help reduce symptoms and help recognize when it may be necessary to see a physician.\n\n\nOther illnesses, such as severe depression, anxiety and seasonal affective disorder can also cause fatigue but are not also related to the timing of your menstrual period.[28]",
                "Track your symptoms. Pay close attention to your symptoms throughout the month. Keep a calendar in which you chart how energetic you feel each day. Use a ranking system of one to 10 to help chart the days of the month you feel fatigued. Also chart your menstrual periods, both ovulation and menstruation.\n\n\nThis is to help determine if there is a correlation between when you begin to feel fatigued each month and when your menstrual period is starting.",
                "Watch for abnormally heavy periods. If you have abnormally heavy periods or feel that your blood loss has gradually increased over time, you may be suffering from fatigue related to iron deficiency; however, before running out to the pharmacy to get an over-the-counter iron supplement, it is important that you determine you are not losing blood from loss through your stool or any other source of bleeding in your body.[29]\n\nYou and your physician can discuss testing which may be necessary to evaluate your anemia.",
                "Look for signs of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is a combination of symptoms related to the menstrual period and the hormones which control this event. The disorder is more severe that Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and will cause greater fatigue and other more severe physical and mental disturbances. You and your doctor will develop a plan to help relieve the symptoms of PMDD, including fatigue, which will include exercise, exercise, and possibly medications.[30] Common symptoms include:\n\n\nLack of interest in daily activities\nSadness, hopelessness, sometimes thoughts of suicide\nAnxiety and out of control feelings\nFood cravings\nBinge eating\nMood swings, crying attacks, and irritability\nBloating, headaches, breast tenderness, muscle pain, and joint pain\nProblems sleeping and concentrating[31]"

        "How to Remove the Rind from Brie Cheese": {
            "intro": "Lots of people eat brie with the rind intact, but many find its taste and texture unappetizing. The trouble is, the soft, gooey cheese sticks to the rind like glue, making it difficult to remove the rind without taking half the cheese with it. The solution? Freeze the brie before slicing off the top, bottom and sides with a serrated knife, then let it come to room temperature (or bake it) and serve.",
            "steps": [
                "Wrap the brie tightly in plastic wrap. This will protect it from freezer burn and keep the texture and flavor fresh. Use several pieces of plastic wrap and make sure the entire rind is covered.[1]",
                "Place the brie in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. During this time the brie will harden, which will make it easier to remove the rind.\n\n\n30 minutes is the minimum amount of time necessary to give the brie the chance to firm up. If you have more time, it's fine to freeze the brie for a few hours or even overnight.",
                "Take the brie out of the freezer and remove the plastic wrap. If the brie still feels soft, put it back in the freezer for another half hour. This method only works if the brie is completely firm. If it feels stiff to the touch, place the brie on a cutting board.",
                "Slice off the top and bottom. Stand the brie on its side and use a serrated knife to slice both circular ends off of the brie. Once you've made the cut, use your fingers to pry off the rind. If the brie is sufficiently firm, the top and bottom should be easy to cut off.\n\n\nIf it's difficult to slice through the brie or remove the rind from the cheese, wrap the brie in plastic and place it in the freezer for an additional 30 minutes, then try again.",
                "Slice off the sides. Lay the brie flat against the cutting board. Use the serrated knife to cut along the edge of the brie to slice off the sides. As you cut, start pulling the sides of the rind away from the brie, bit by bit. Continue until you've completely removed the rind from the brie.\n\n\nIn order to keep the brie from sticking to the cutting board, you might want to lay a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper on the board before setting down the wheel of cheese.\nIf the cheese seems to be sticking to the rind, wrap the wheel in plastic wrap and place it in the freezer to harden before trying again.",

                "Slice off the top. Place the brie on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to slice the top off of the brie. Once you've made the cut, use your fingers to pry off the rind. If the brie is sufficiently firm, the top should be easy to cut off.\n\n\nSlicing off just the top leaves a \"bowl\" for the creamy cheese to be scooped from when eating or preparing to serve. This same method can be used for a pie slice of brie as well. If preferred all the rind can be removed before cooking or serving.\nUse caution to remove as little of the creamy cheese as possible and only remove the white dry rind.",
                "Bake the brie bowl. Put the brie in a baking dish and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees. It should be shiny and creamy when done.",
                "Top it with preserves or marmalade. Tart, sweet berry or orange jam perfectly complements the creamy, salty brie.[2]",
                "Serve with crackers. Whole wheat or water crackers are both excellent with baked brie."

                "Remove any remaining food scraps from the sponge.",

According to a study by the USDA, microwaving for one minute significantly lowers bacteria counts and populations of mold and yeast more than other methods.[3] Researchers have also discovered that after microwaving for two minutes, more than 99% of all the living bacteria will be dead.[4]\n\nIt's a good idea to place at least a half-cup of water in the microwave with the sponge to be cleaned. This helps to protect your microwave emitter.",

        "wikiHow to Go on Google in China": {
            "intro": "You must use a virtual private network (VPN) to access Google from China, as there are no official or \"legal\" ways to do so. A VPN is a program that lets you pretend you're accessing the internet from somewhere other than where you are. In this case, it lets you pretend that you're accessing Google from the US, where it's not banned – even while you're in China, where it is.",
            "steps": [
                "Download a VPN to disguise your IP address. A virtual private network (VPN) obscures the content you are accessing by routing it through a private (and usually encrypted) connection. Many free VPNs will have limits on either bandwidth or total dataflow per day.[1] You can subscribe to higher-volume VPNs for about $10 a month, which may be worth the investment if you know you'll be using them a lot. Consider sharing one VPN account with a few friends to split up the cost.\n\n\nVisit https://en.greatfire.org/ to check whether a given website is blocked or otherwise restricted in China.",
                "Understand that the Chinese Internet will not return Western search results. Most Chinese internet users don't need to worry about this, because they generally prefer using sites hosted inside of China that the Chinese government does not block. Baidu, for instance, is a search engine that is more popular in China than Google, and it is not blocked by the government. The broader issue is that Baidu only turns up search results from China – and blocks the rest of the world. Many say that the Chinese government has banned Google and other websites largely for the purpose of keeping Chinese citizens out of the global loop.[2]\n\nWhen you use Baidu instead of Google, you will find what Chinese people search. When you search Google, you will find data from around the world.\nThe same goes for videos: when you search Youku instead of Youtube, you will find what Chinese people search and post. You may find some foreign videos put online by Chinese people, but the service still has its limits.",
                "Know that it is technically legal to use a VPN. The Chinese government has never stated that it is illegal to use a VPN to circumvent the \"Great Firewall\", and nobody has been prosecuted for using a VPN. Despite this, China blocks the websites of most major VPNs. If you access websites that operate in China, remember that they've agreed to disclose information about where you're accessing the site from—and what you're doing on them—upon request from the Chinese government.",
                "Explore this list of popular VPNs. Know that any of these providers may or not have been disabled by the Chinese government by the time you read this. Do your research before you download a VPN, and make sure that it hasn't been banned.\n\n\nfqrouter: Works well for Android. It is free, and it works best if your phone is rooted. If you use a USB to tether your phone to your laptop, you can get access to unblocked Internet on both devices. This VPN has a stable proxy and a wide range of functions.\nSuperVPN: Works with Android. First 30 days are free. After the trial, you can get one free hour, but you must connect again after every hour.\nExpressVPN: Made to run quickly and stably in China. You can use various apps. The service hosts servers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and the west coast of the US. You can get your money back within 30 days, no questions asked. ExpressVPN takes PayPal, most major credit cards, Bitcoin, Unionpay, Alipay, Webmoney, and CashU.\nVyprVPN: Works with Windows or Linux. You get 500 MB free each month, but you have to pay for more. Works well when configured with OpenVPN. Use the Chameleon Protocol they offer which was developed to get around the Great Firewall. VyprVPN also accepts Alipay and has recently reduced their price points.\n12VPN: Headquartered in Hong Kong, and they have experience with the Great Firewall, many Chinese customers. 7 day money back policy. But no P2P downloading/torrenting.\nVPN.AC: Various features for Chinese users, including the ability to make OpenVPN traffic look like regular SSL traffic. There are servers in Hong Kong, Singapore, the west coast of the US. The service also features peering with China Telecom and China Unicom.",
                "Understand that VPNs come and go. The Chinese government occasionally shuts down some VPN providers, mostly because they crossed some political or other line, but this has no effect on you if you've already downloaded the software. Currently, China is blocking all VPNs at the protocol level (including corporate VPNs). However, there are other VPN providers that stealth techniques to hide their VPN traffic.[3]\n\nAsk locals for up-to-date advice on VPN choices. Most people living there will be able to point you to their favorite, free VPNs.\nIt's rare that already-downloaded VPNs are rendered useless. However, if you find that your VPN provider of choice has been shut down and has become inaccessible to newer users, don't worry – there's always another VPN out there.",
                "Bear in mind that VPNs might make some domestic Chinese websites inaccessible. For example, many shopping sites will list Chinese prices—which are typically much cheaper than foreign prices—only when your IP address indicates that you've accessed the site from within China. This means that when you're using your VPN, the site will hide these prices from you because it thinks you're accessing it from outside China – say, the US.",
                "Use a VPN protocol. You will need to download a VPN protocol—a host, of sorts—to set up most of the VPN providers.\n\n\nOpenVPN: This is currently a less stable protocol/client, although it has been reliable in the past. Know that most ports are blocked – connection reset. The primary cause seems to be spoofed RST packets.[4]\n\nL2TP: This is a quick protocol for China. At the time of posting, it functions well.\nPPTP: Only use this if L2TP isn't working. PPTP is generally slower and less predictable than L2TP.\nSSTP: Use SSTP to connect over secure HTTPS (Port 443). This lets clients access networks securely behind NAT routers, firewalls, and web proxies. You won't need to worry about the usual port-blocking problems.",
                "Download and install the VPN. Simply run a web search for the VPN client that you plan to use. For instance, \"download ExpressVPN\". You should find a link to the VPN protocol website. If you can't find a website, try downloading a program on a torrent site.",
                "Run the VPN program. The interface will be slightly different for each VPN, but you will almost always be prompted to choose a country. This country (e.g. South Korea or Canada) is the country from which you will be pretending to access Google. The VPN will scramble your IP address so that it looks like you're accessing the site from X foreign country. If the VPN has not been restricted by the Chinese government, you should be able to circumvent the Great Firewall.",
                "Choose which country you want to mask your IP address. Once the VPN is downloaded, select the country that you want to connect to – for instance, the United States or South Korea. Once you've connected, you should be able to visit any site that's blocked in China: Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, etc. When in China, try to connect to a VPN server in Asia (e.g. in China, Hong Kong, Bangkok). The next-best option is to connect to a server on the west coast of the US (e.g. Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco).\n\n\nChinese users are often visiting websites based in Mainland China, so the VPN server must be based near the country to keep speeds fast. Westerners, on the other hand, need a server based as close as possible to the web server's country of origin – for instance, choose a US IP address to access a US website.\nWestern websites will always load much faster through a VPN closer to the home country than to China. On the flip side, Chinese websites will load very slowly with a western IP, because you're routing the web traffic to the other side of the world, then back again.",
                "Make sure that you have solid broadband connection. Working through a VPN requires much more bandwidth than a standard internet connection. Thus, it cannot be done easily on slower internet connections – especially public networks in places like cafes, airport terminals, and hotels.",
                "Be careful using Google in China, even with a VPN. When you're using Google services, don't try to search for sensitive keywords that might catch the attention of the Chinese government. Your connection will be reset, meaning that you'll be shut off of the Internet for about 90 seconds. You should be able to get back on when you can see the website's logo again."

Some common human foods can lead to severe symptoms in your dog, and others may even lead to death. If you want to feed your dog human food, know which foods to avoid to keep them safe. Never feed your dog food items such as chocolate, most fruit seeds or pits, alcohol, products containing caffeine, grapes, and onions.",
            "steps": [
                "Refrain from giving your dog alcohol. You should never give your dog alcohol. Foods or drinks with alcohol in them can cause problems for your dog. This includes beer, liquor, and wine.[1]\n\nAlcohol can cause digestive problems like vomiting and diarrhea, problems breathing and with coordination, tremors, and coma. Alcohol can also lead to death in dogs.",
                "Keep your dog away from caffeine. Caffeine and products containing caffeine can cause problems for your dog. Caffeine is included in coffee, tea, chocolate, and sodas. These can cause diarrhea and vomiting, panting, excessive urination and thirst, hyperactivity, seizures, and tremors. It can also lead to death.[2]\n\nDark chocolate is the most dangerous chocolate. White chocolate has the lowest level of caffeine and theobromine.",
                "Avoid giving your dog dairy. Dairy products can cause problems for dogs. These include milk, cheese, and yogurt. Dogs are lactose intolerant, so they cannot digest milk. This leads to digestive distress, such as diarrhea, gas, and bloating.[3]",
                "Refrain from giving your dog macadamia nuts. Macadamia nuts can cause almost immediate problems in dogs. Within 12 hours, your dog may show weakness and depression, start vomiting, experience tremors, and suffer from hypothermia. You should refrain from giving your dog any nuts due to the oils and fats.[4]\n\nThese symptoms may last for up to two days.",
                "Avoid foods containing xylitol. Xylitol has been proven dangerous for dogs. Since xylitol is a sugar substitute, it doesn’t affect a human’s blood sugar level. However, in dogs, the xylitol can trigger a dangerous level of insulin to release from the pancreas.[5]\n\nXylitol can be found in sugar-free candy, breath mints, baked goods, medications, and toothpaste.",
                "Do not give your dog raisins and grapes. Grapes and raisins can be extremely harmful to your dog. There are substances found in grapes that are toxic to dogs, even though experts don’t know what it is. Don’t give this to your dog because it can cause kidney failure.[6]",
                "Avoid fruit seeds or pits. The flesh part of the fruits are mostly okay for dogs, but the seeds or pits are toxic. Apple seeds and peach pits contain chemicals that release cyanide in the body when it’s digested. Pear seeds contain small amounts of arsenic. Be wary of persimmon seeds or plum pits.[7]\n\nGenerally, this only occurs when a large amount of seeds are chewed and eaten.\nTo reduce the risk, make sure to remove the core so your dog doesn’t accidentally get a seed.",
                "Refrain from feeding your dog onions and chives. Onions can be extremely harmful to your dog. This is true for any form of the onion, whether it is dry, raw, cooked, or powder. It can even harm your dog if it is in other foods.[8]\n\nOnions are toxic and may lead to anemia or damage your dog’s red blood cells.",
                "Avoid avocado. You may think avocado is healthy and delicious, you should never give it to your dog. It contains something called persin, which can cause allergic reactions to dogs and lead to unpleasant side effects.[9]\n\nThis includes avocado products, like guacamole.",
                "Discourage your dog from chewing on corn cobs. Corn cobs can cause severe problems if your dog eats them. The cob ends up in the small intestine and gets stuck there. It will need to be removed, and if it’s not, your dog could die.[10]\n\nCorn can be digested by your dog, but too much corn can cause digestive upsets.",
                "Avoid giving your dog raw fish. Raw fish can lead to a vitamin B deficiency, which can cause problems. Raw salmon and raw trout are dangerous for dogs because when they are raw, they sometimes contain bacteria-carrying parasites that can prove fatal.[11]\n\nCooked fish should be okay for dogs.",
                "Refrain from giving your dog raw meat. Raw meat has the potential of containing harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella or E. Coli. These bacteria can cause digestive issues, such as vomiting or diarrhea. Only give your dog cooked meat.[12]\n\nThis includes raw eggs. Raw eggs can cause vitamin deficiencies and cause negative symptoms in your dog.\nIf you are unsure about the type of meat to give your dog, talk to your vet.",
                "Use caution when giving your dog bones. Bones can be dangerous for your dog. Bones soften during cooking, so cooked bones can easily splinter in your dog’s mouth as they chew on it. This can cause injuries in the mouth or become a choking hazard. Small chicken bones or fish bones can splinter and cause problems.[13]\n\nLarger raw, uncooked bones are okay for the dog. Talk to your vet if you are unsure.",
                "Keep your dog away from old food. Food that is spoiled or moldy can cause problems for your dog. They may get sick from the bacteria and end up with a variety of symptoms. Make sure to properly throw food away so your dog can’t get in it.[14]",
                "Stop giving your dog leftovers. Many people give their dogs leftovers, especially after your dog has sat there and watched you eat with puppy eyes. While you won’t get sick from your plate, your dog might. Avoid giving them any leftovers.[15]\n\nDogs are sensitive to common foods, like onions, capsaicin found in spicy foods, fat, dairy, sugar, and nuts. They may come into contact with any of this through leftovers.",
                "Buy foods that do not contain artificial preservatives. Many dog food companies are putting artificial preservatives in dog food now to extend the shelf life. These chemical preservatives can be toxic for dogs. When buying dog food, avoid the following ingredients:[16]\n\nButylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\nButylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\nPropylene glycol\nEthoxyquin\nTBHQ\nPropyl gallate"

        "wikiHow to Pickle Beets": {
            "intro": "Pickled beets are an easy-to-make summer favorite, combining sweet and tangy flavors. Traditional pickled beets are cooked, peeled and pickled in the refrigerator for about a week before they're ready. In a pinch, you can make marinated \"pickled\" beets that are ready the same day. If you love pickled beets and want them to keep for up to a year, follow instructions for canning the beets.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash and trim the beets. Fresh beets often have bits of dirt on them, so use a vegetable brush if necessary to scrub it away. On a cutting board, remove the greens and stems using a sharp knife.\n\n\nWhen you're choosing beets, make sure they're firm and unbruised. Beets that are soft to the touch or discolored are not fresh enough to pickle. Make sure to use high-quality fresh beets.\nIf your beets came with the greens attached, you can save them and cook them up for a tasty green treat. Beet greens are delicious chopped and sauteed in butter or olive oil.",
                "Boil the beets. It's necessary to cook them before you pickle them, and the most common way to do so is boiling. Place the beets in a medium-sized pot with water. Bring it to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot and allow to cook for 25-30 minutes.[1]\n\nThere is another way to cook the beets: you can roast them. This will result in a slightly different final texture and flavor. Wrap them in aluminum foil and roast at 350 °F (177 °C) for about an hour, until the beets are cooked through.[2]",
                "Drain the beets and remove the skin. The beets should be tender to the touch, and the skin should come off easily using your hands. You may want to let them cool for a few minutes before handling.",
                "Cut the beets on a cutting board. It's common to slice beets for pickling, but you could also cut them into quarters or bite-sized pieces. Whole beets will take longer to completely pickle than sliced beets. When you're finished, place beets into one or more large jars.\n\n\nGlass mason jars are the best storage containers for pickled beets, since the glass won't react with the pickling brine.\nDo not use a metal or plastic container, since these materials could react with the pickling brine and taint the beets.",
                "Make the pickling brine. Add the vinegar, water, sugar, and garlic to a small pot. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow the mixture to cook for five minutes, then remove it from heat and allow it to cool completely.",
                "Pour the cooled brine over the beets in the jar. You should have enough to completely cover the beets. Cover the jar and place it in the refrigerator.",
                "Let the beets pickle in the refrigerator for at least one week. Stir the mixture occasionally so the brine touches all edges of the beets. Pickled beets can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three months.",
                "Wash and trim the beets. Scrub away the dirt using a vegetable brush. On a cutting board, remove the greens and stems from the beets. Reserve the greens to cook separately if you'd like.",
                "Boil the beets. Place them in a medium-sized pot, cover with water and boil the beets for 30 minutes. Remove them from heat and allow them to cool. The beets should be tender when finished, and skin should come off easily.",
                "Peel and slice the beets. Remove the beets from the water and use your hands to peel away the skin, which should come off with no trouble. On a cutting board, slice the beets into quarters or discs.",
                "Make the pickling marinade. Combine the cider vinegar, sugar, olive oil, and dry mustard in a small bowl. Whisk together the ingredients, adding salt and pepper to taste.",
                "Combine the beets and the pickling marinade. Toss them together in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Allow the beets to marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.",
                "Chill the beets. If you'd prefer not to serve them at room temperature, store the beets, covered, in the refrigerator for about an hour, and serve chilled.[3]",
                "Finished.",
                "Sanitize your canning jars. You can boil them for 10 minutes or simply run them through the dishwasher's hottest cycle. Be sure to sanitize the lids and rings as well. When you're finished, set the canning supplies on a clean dishcloth until you're ready to fill up the jars.",
                "Heat your canner. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to heat up your canner in preparation for canning beets. You can use either a plain open water bath canner or a pressure canner.[4]",
                "Boil and peel the beets. After scrubbing and trimming off the green part, put the beets in a large pot and cover them with water. Boil the beets for 30 minutes, until the skins start to come off on their own. Let the beets cool before peeling them.",
                "Slice the beets into 1/4-inch pieces. Slicing them into small pieces will allow you to pack more beets into your canning jars, and the seasonings will penetrate the pieces more easily.[5]",
                "Make the pickling brine. Using the method for making traditional pickled beets, mix up the vinegar, water, sugar, and garlic to a large pot. Bring the ingredients to a full, rolling boil.",
                "Add the beets to the brine. Carefully put them in the boiling brine and cook them for 5 minutes. Make sure the mixture is boiling before you pour it into the jars.",
                "Portion the beets and brine among the jars. Fill each jar to within 1/2-inch of the top. It's important to leave a little headspace so that the jars don't pop open in storage from the pressure. Put the lids on the jar and screw the rings on until they're snug, but not too tight.",
                "Put the jars in the canner to process the beets. Operate the canner according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard processing time for beets is 30 minutes, but this can differ depending on what type of canner you're using as well as your altitude.",
                "Allow the jars to cool after processing. Lift them out of the canner using a jar lifter and let them rest on the counter until they come to room temperature.",
                "Check the lids before storing. If the jars were properly canned, the lids should be sucked down. Remove the rings from the jars without removing the lids to be sure they are properly suctioned in place. If the jars were properly canned, place them in a cool, dark pantry for storage. They have a shelf life of about one year if kept in cool, dark conditions.\n\n\nIf the lids pop off when you remove the rings, the canning was not properly done. You can still eat the beets if you place the jar in the refrigerator right away, but you won't be able to store the jars for a year with the other properly canned beets."

        "How to Use the Beck Depression Inventory": {
            "intro": "The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was published in 1996 and is a reliable self-report inventory used to evaluate the symptoms of depression.[1] It is a short inventory that can easily be administered in 10 to 15 minutes. The items are easy to understand and rate, and the scoring procedure is very simple. By taking and then periodically retaking the BDI, you can not only evaluate your depression but track its progress and the success of any treatment, including making note of particular areas (insomnia, etc.) that may not be responding to your current treatment.[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Familiarize yourself with the Beck Depression Inventory. There is a lot of information online about the administration and scoring of the Beck Depression Inventory. It's a good idea to do some online research before you begin. Here is some valuable information about the inventory:[3]\n\nIt is a 21 item self-report inventory.\nIt is used to evaluate depression in both clinical and non-clinical patients.\nIt was developed to be administered on adolescents and adults, so it can be used by anyone 13 and above.\nIt uses a rating tool where each item is rated on a four point scale from 0-3.\n0 means you are experiencing no symptoms, while 3 means you are experiencing a severe form of the symptoms.\nThe inventory has been translated into various languages.",
                "Read the test items carefully. In order to use this tool for self-administration or to administer it to someone else, you should first read all of the items carefully along with the instructions.\n\n\nFor example, a question may ask you to respond by circling the response that most accurately describes you, such as\n\n0: I do not feel sad\n1: I feel sad some of the time\n2: I am sad all the time\n3: I am so sad or unhappy that I can’t stand.[4]",
                "Get acquainted with the administration procedure. This is very important for administering the inventory.\n\n\nFirst of all, you have to rate the items based on your condition during the past two weeks as well as they day you administer the test.\nIf you feel that multiple statements describe your condition equally, choose the response with the higher number on the 0-3 scale. For example if you think 2 and 3 are equally representative of your condition, choose statement 3.[5]\n\nLastly, item 16 (changes in sleeping pattern) and item 18 (changes in appetite) are rated on a seven-point scale instead of the normal four-point scale. However, these items are not given any more weight than the others when calculating your results.[6]",
                "Try to administer the test in a distraction-free environment. When you take or administer the test, make sure to do it in a quiet room. You should give the test your undivided attention. Take care of any needs (bathroom, snack, etc.) before the test.\n\n\nGive yourself ample time to complete the test--don’t rush through it.\nTake it when you feel well enough to concentrate on your responses. Don’t take the test if you’re distracted by a headache or stomach ache, etc.",
                "Try to answer as accurately as you can. Carefully read each question and make sure you understand what’s being asked. Always try to give the answer that most closely matches your condition over the past two weeks.[7]\n\nBecause you can only choose a single item out of four statements, try to judge your emotions, feelings, or behaviors as precisely as possible.",
                "Score the items. Simply add up all the ratings to get your score. For example, if you have circled 0 on the first item and 3 on second, you’ll add them to get a score of 3 for the first two items.\n\n\nProceed in the same manner for the rest of items until you have added the results for all 21 items.\nNote down your total score. It will fall in between the range of 0 to 63.",
                "Assess your score. There are no arbitrary cutoff points for diagnosing each category of depression. However, there are ranges of scores which indicate the particular category of depression a person is passing through. Once you have calculated your total score, simply compare your score with the following categories:[8]\n\nScore of 0 to 13: no depression\nScore of 14 to 19: mild depression\nScore of 20 to 28: moderate depression\nScore of 29 to 63: severe depression[9]",
                "Keep track of your depression. If you have previously been diagnosed with depression, the Beck Depression Inventory can be used on a weekly basis to check on your progress, especially if you have begun therapy and started taking medications.[10] This is very helpful for the following reasons:\n\n\nYou can identify any changes in your emotional state.\nYou can identify the areas where depression is still high, such as if you still have difficulty sleeping or have thoughts about suicide.\nOnce you have identified the areas that are still causing a problem, you can start working to improve them with the help of your therapist.\nRegularly checking in with your progress helps to give you motivation for further change."

            "intro": "Whether you're preparing a chicken dinner for your in-laws but are short on time, are hankering for some chicken but don't want to wait around for it to roast, or simply just try something new, the broiler will come to your rescue. Broiling chicken is fast and easy. Follow these steps to become a broiling pro.",
            "steps": [
                "Defrost your chicken if it has been frozen. The best way to do this is to transfer the wrapped chicken from your freezer to your fridge 24 hours before you want to cook. If you are on a tighter schedule, there are other methods to defrost chicken that take less time.",
                "Wash your chicken. Hold your chicken under cold running water. Make sure that you do not use warm or hot water because hot water can lead to bacterial growth.",
                "Give your chicken some extra flavor. There is a limitless number of ways you can flavor your chicken. Get creative and try new combinations of seasonings and marinades. If you are following a specific recipe, add your seasonings now. Don’t forget salt and pepper![1]\n\nOil and season your chicken. Rub cooking oil such as olive oil on the chicken to get a crispier outside texture. Add seasonings like thyme, oregano, lemon, garlic, or any other herb or seasoning to add some pizzazz to your poultry. You can also use a store bought rub like Cajun or spicy chili rub. To most thoroughly coat the chicken, pour the oil and seasonings into a plastic, sealable bag. Put the chicken inside, seal the bag, and shake.\n\nMarinate your chicken. Pour your marinade into a bowl and let the chicken soak in the marinade for two to eight hours. Make sure to keep the chicken and marinade in the fridge while it soaks. Leaving it for eight hours or more will ensure the most flavorful results.\n\nBrine your chicken. Brine gives chicken an extra salty flavor and can be combined with many different seasonings. Mix coarse salt into warm water and add your desired seasonings. Some people also add sugar to their brine. Let the chicken soak in the brine for two to eight hours (keep it in the fridge while it is soaking.)",
                "Flatten the chicken. Make the chicken as flat as possible before broiling to help ensure an even cooking. Butterfly the chicken if you’re using a whole breast or bird.[2]",
                "Line the bottom of the broiler tray beneath the grate with aluminum foil. Do this before you place the chicken on it. The foil will catch any drips from the chicken and will make cleanup easier. Do not line the grate itself with aluminum foil, as this will prevent the drippings from falling away from the element.",

Set the oven rack approximately 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) below the element so the chicken is right beneath the element if using an oven broiler.\n\nIf you do not have a broiler tray you can use a baking sheet instead.\nIf using a slide out broiler beneath the oven, set the broiler tray directly on the bottom rack.",
                "Broil the chicken. Broil thinner cuts for 10 minutes and thicker cuts for 15 minutes.",
                "Take the chicken out once it has browned on one side. Turn it over and rub a little bit of cooking oil (such as olive oil) on the uncooked side. Doing this will ensure that the chicken browns and gets a little crispy.\n\nUse a spatula to turn the chicken over, rather than a fork. This will prevent the juices from escaping the meat before it's done.",

The internal temperature should be 180 °F (82 °C) for chicken thighs and drumsticks, 170 °F (77 °C) for breast meat and 165 °F (74 °C) for patties.[3]\n\nIf you do not have a meat thermometer, take the chicken out and make a small cut in it. If the chicken meat is pink or shiny and grayish looking, it is not done. Your chicken should be white and opaque.\nYou should also check the color of the juices. The chicken juices will run clear when it is cooked all the way through.",

        "wikiHow to Install Ceramic Wall Tile": {
            "intro": "Ceramic tile is a versatile and durable finishing material. Tiles can be installed as a floor or wall covering nearly anywhere, but they are especially useful in bathrooms and kitchens. Tiled walls can resist moisture and handle scrubbing much more readily than drywall or other materials, and so they are the ideal choice for humid bathrooms and kitchens where they will be exposed to cooking splatters. Learning how to install ceramic wall tile is a task well within the reach of an average homeowner. The process requires only a few tools and materials.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure your wall is ready to go. Once you've removed the current wall dressings and wall items, like light switch covers, you'll want to check the base layer that you will be building on to make sure that it is structurally sound. This is important, since a rotting or weak wall can cause your tiling job to warp, crack, or even break and fall down.\n\n\nLook for signs of mold or damage to the tiling surface. Cracks are often a sign that a wall may be weak and need to be replaced.\nTry pressing on the wall, especially at the studs. If it gives way or feels soft, it may require work.\nIf you are going to be tiling a large area, remember to use tiling board as a backer and not just put the tiles directly onto drywall.[1] Tiling board is installed just like drywall (nailed to the studs) but is made of more water resistant materials which will keep it from warping and cracking your tile work.",
                "Use a level and tape to measure for your tile locations. Now, using a level and measuring tape, measure and mark for the middle lines in the area you will be tiling.[2] You want to find both the vertical and horizontal middle, since you will use these to keep your tiles straight and divide the area into sections for tiling.\n\n\nNever assume a fixture in the room like the tub or vanity (or even the ceiling) is perfectly level. They rarely are. It is very important to rely on the level.",
                "Mark the locations on the wall using a chalk line. Using a chalk snap line, mark the mid-line and vertical lines which you just measured. If you've never used a chalk snap line before, don't worry: it's easy. Simply place a nail at one end of the space you marked, attach the string, pull it taut and snap it down. This will leave a straight line on your wall. You'll still want to check it for level but it's much more accurate than drawing a line.\n\n\nYou can use just regular string and manually chalk it to make a chalk line but using a chalk box, which are easily bought for about $5, will generally be a lot less work.",
                "Dry fit and then cut tiles to size using a diamond wet saw. Dry fit your tiles to be sure that they will look the way you want them to look. Once you're comfortable with how it looks, figure out how the tiles will meet up with the corners and edges of your wall. You will probably need only a part of a tile when it comes to some of these areas, so it will be necessary to cut the tiles to size. Measure how much space you need for each row with the spaces and cut tiles to size using a diamond tipped wet saw.\n\n\nSo, for example, let's say your wall to tile is five feet long. You're putting up subway tile and the tiles are 6\", with spaces of 1/4\" between each of them. You'll need 9.6 tiles for each row to cover that space, meaning nine full tiles and one cut to 3.6\"\nIf you don't own a diamond tipped wet saw, you can usually rent one from your local major hardware store. You can also use a tile cutter, but this is more likely to end in broken tiles so only take this option if using cheaper tiles. [3]\n\nDry fitting is especially important if your tiles make up a pattern, since you will need to be very comfortable creating that pattern. You don't want to make a mistake or have to spend a lot of time thinking about it once the mortar is up on your wall.\nYou can test your dry fit pattern by making a layout stick, which can be made from any straight and level piece of spare wood. Lay the tiles on a floor and mark the layout stick with a pencil at the joints between tiles. Use the layout stick to see how the tiles fit on the wall.",
                "Install a batten to keep your first row straight. With everything else ready to go, you'll want to install a batten to help keep your tile rows straight. This is a piece of scrap wood, such as a piece of 1x4 lumber, that you use as a long straight-edge, placing the first row of tiles right against the batten. Align the top edge of the wood so that it follows exactly along the mid-level line that you marked, then screw it into the studs. Once the tiles have been placed, simply unscrew and remove the batten.\n\n\nDouble check that everything is level before installing the tiles on the batten. You'll also want to check it all the way across, since there may be dips in the wood you use for your batten.",
                "Mix the mortar. You'll need thin set mortar to lay your tiles. While you should always go by the manufacturer's instructions, a general rule of thumb is to start with the powder in a bucket and just add water slowly and mix until the consistency of the mortar becomes like peanut butter.\n\n\nYou should also allow it to \"slake\" after you first mix it up. This means you allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes and then stir it up again. Now it is ready to use.",
                "Spread the mortar. Working in a roughly 2x3'[4] area, use a tiling trowel to apply the mortar. Hold the notched trowel at a shallow angle against the wall, so that the notches on one of its long sides dig grooves into the mortar. Use long, sweeping motions to apply the mortar. The direction of the grooves doesn’t matter but the lines should all be roughly parallel.\n\n\nYour trowel size will depend on the size and type of tile you're using.[5] For the average small wall tiles which are currently popular, you will want to use a 1x4\" square notch trowel.\nTest a tile to make sure the mortar is mixed and spread correctly. Mortar a small spot and then place a tile. Pull the tile up and look at the pattern that is create on the back. If you see clear lines, then the mortar is too dry. If you see goopy mounds then the mortar is too wet.",
                "Place your tiles on the wall. With the mortar ready to go, you can start placing your tiles. Just twist them into place, sticking to the small area that you prepared for yourself. Place your spacers between each tile as you go. These are usually cross shaped and placed at the corners but if you have unusual tiles you may have to improvise, such as by placing only one arm between tiles and letting the rest of the spacer stick out.\n\n\nIf the mortar rises up between the tiles as you place them, the bed is too thick and you will need a smaller trowel.\nCheck the tiles for level as you go. This is when a laser level can really come in handy.",
                "Choose and mix your grout. You'll need to choose what grout is appropriate for your project, depending on how large the gaps are between your tiles. Once you've chosen, mix the grout according to the packaging directions, being sure to also mix any additives you want. Usually, you will start with the water in a bowl or bucket and add powder until the consistency is like toothpaste. Mix only what you can spread in about 20 minutes, since mixing any more risks the product drying out.\n\n\nSanded grout is used for gaps larger than 3mm.\nUnsanded grout is used for gaps smaller than 3mm.\nYou can find all sorts of additives at your local hardware store. These can do everything from making the grout more water resistant to changing the color to match your tiles.",
                "Spread the grout, using a grout float. Now, spread the grout (using a grout float) in a roughly 3x3' area, or whatever size you can grout in about 20 minutes. Hold the float at a 45° angle and push the grout into the gaps using diagonal swipes.\n\n\nYou do not want to push the grout around parallel to the lines, since this can gouge the grout back out of the gaps.\nYou can save yourself some time by using the grout float to remove as much of the excess grout off of the tiles as possible.",
                "Clean the grout. After allowing the grout to cure for 20 minutes wipe the tiles with a clean, damp sponge to remove any excess grout from the tiled surface. Wipe just a small area, clean out the sponge, and then wipe some more.\n\n\nIt is best to do this for each small area as you complete it but you can wait until you have done two to four small areas as well. Keep in mind, however, that it will be much harder to get the grout off and the final look may not be as professional.",
                "Allow it to cure. Now, allow the grout to cure for three hours or whatever amount of time is recommended on your product directions. Make sure that the area remains dry and that it gets adequate ventilation.\n\n\nSome additives may cause the grout to cure more slowly. See the included packaging for any addendums to the curing process.\nYou can clean off any remaining residue after the grout has cured. An old sock or dry rag work well for this.",
                "Seal the grout. Once you have installed all of your tile, you'll want to apply a grout sealer. This will help keep mold from growing in the gaps and will need to be reapplied usually every year (preferably every six months). Though every sealer is different, usually it is a wax which must be applied in a circular motion with a rag.\n\n\nYou can also get brush-on or spray-on tile sealer.\nDo not put these sealers on non-glazed, unfinished tile. It will absorb into and possibly stain the tile."

Do not deviate from this plan when you do go shopping. Choose meals based on your current stock, sales, coupons, and the number of required ingredients. Save money on the food itself by purchasing in season or frozen produce, or by gravitating toward cheaper cuts of meat instead of more expensive counterparts.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose meals with fewer ingredients. In most cases, a dinner that involves five ingredients will cost less than one that requires ten. Search for recipes that only use a few ingredients and do not require anything too exotic.",

                "Take inventory of your stock at home. Before you plan out your meals, look at the ingredients you already have at home. Comb through your spice cabinet and your pantry. If you have any product nearing its expiration date, plan a meal that will allow you to use it. Likewise, if you have an excess amount of any given product, plan a meal using that, as well.",

Mark down every ingredient you do not already have in your pantry, and jot down sizes and quantities as applicable. Do not go shopping without a list, since you may forget some items or walk away with something you do not need.",
                "Clip coupons. Look through junk mail, magazines, and online for coupons that offer you savings on the products you need. Be careful about what coupons you use, though. Some brands may cost more than others even with a coupon. Always compare prices instead of assuming that the product with a coupon offers the best bargain.",
                "Shop sales. Most chain grocery stores have weekly sales. Many stores have pamphlets that they send out via mail or keep inside the store. Flip through these sale pamphlets to learn what products are on sale this week and plan meals that could use those products.",
                "Buy in bulk. If there is a certain product you cook with frequently, such as vegetable oil or salt, consider buying large quantities of it to save on the cost per serving. Compare prices of the bulk amount with the smaller amount to ensure that you receive a bargain. Also make sure to only buy bulk products you can actually use before the expiration date.",

                "Go with frozen or canned produce. Frozen and canned products cost less than their fresh counterparts and are usually just as nutritious. In fact, since these products are picked at the peak of ripeness, they may even contain more nutrients than partially ripe fresh produce. Go with frozen produce for the healthiest option, since it usually contains fewer preservatives than canned foods.",

Bone-in pieces and whole chickens will save you on cost per serving. You can even remove the bones before you cook the chicken and save them to make stock later on.",
                "Opt for tougher cuts of meat. Tougher cuts of meat, like beef chuck roasts and pork shoulders, cost less than tender cuts. Slow cooking these meats using low heat can make them just as delectable, though. Try preparing a stew or slow-cooker meal using these cuts.",

            "intro": "With their sharp interlocking teeth, it can be difficult to know the proper way to sharpen your old pinking shears to keep them in good working order. If you have access to the right equipment, it's a quick process of sharpening the flat side of the blade and honing it to a proper edge. You can learn the steps to keep your shears in proper working order and well-maintained. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Examine the shears to find the lap line. A different kind of metal with a slightly different color is used for the cutting surface on most good-quality pair of pinking shears. Hold the blade and look at it from the side: there should be a shiny metal on the bottom side, a distinct line, and a darker matte grey metal on the cutting surface.[1]\n\nIf you don't see this, the shears need to be replaced. They've worn out over time and there's nothing left to sharpen.\nTo sharpen pinking shears, you won't ever sharpen between the individual \"teeth\" on the blade, which would ruin the action of the shears and make it so they wouldn't cut properly. Instead, you want to sharpen along the flat edge of those teeth on the cutting surface, honing the teeth all the way from the \"peak\" at the top of each tooth to the \"valley\" at the bottom.",
                "Set the proper angle of the clamp. The blades of most pinking shears have an angle of between 0 and 5 degrees, and some have a slightly negative angle at which you'll need to set the the clamp to sharpen them properly. Estimate the angle, or start at 0 and perform a scratch test to see if the clamp is set properly.[2]\n\nSecure the shears in the clamp so the flat side of the blade is perpendicular to the sharpening wheel.",
                "Do a scratch test. Use a permanent marker and blacken the flat blade side of the pinking shears you're going to sharpen. Make sure you darken all the way up to each peak and down to each valley. You don't need to color between them, just on the flat side you're going to sharpen.\n\n\nRotate the sharpening wheel with your hand (you don't need to turn it on) to scratch the blade quickly on it to see if you've got the clamp set at the proper angle. You should see the blacking start to wear off on the blade, not lower on the silver side or too high on the peaks. Adjust the blade accordingly before you start sharpening.",
                "Grind the blacking off. When you've got the clamp set appropriately, turn on your machine and do a few passes with the blade. After three or four, turn it off again and examine your blade to make sure you're grinding evenly. If the black is removed, you're doing a good job. Do a few more passes, pausing every now and then to examine them, readjusting if necessary.\n\n\nMove the shears across the wheel in only one direction, applying even pressure and being extremely careful to keep your hands and clothes clear of the wheel. Wear safety protection and follow the manual instructions.\nWhen you've done the first, repeat the process for the second blade, maintaining the same angle.",
                "Test the shears. To make sure you've sharpened them evenly, cut some felt or other cloth. Properly sharpened pinking shears should cut with good action all the way down to the tip, and the teeth should pass between each other cleanly.\n\n\nIf you're still having trouble, do a few passes on a honing wheel to get the burrs worked out and get the blade even and clean on the cut. Also check the other components of the shears to make sure they're well-oiled and smooth.",
                "Only use the shears on cloth. Trying to sharpen your shears by cutting into aluminum foil, Brillo pads, or sandpaper is ineffective and can end up damaging the blades by rounding them. Pinking shears need to be sharpened along the flat outside edge of each blade, not in between the valleys. Cutting aluminum or sandpaper rounds off the edges, making them duller and ruining the action, and does nothing to hone the flat side. Use your pinking shears on the appropriate materials and you shouldn't have problems.\n\n\nA roll of heavy-duty foil costs as much as $5 or $6 anyway and you risk ruining your shears at no savings. Get them done properly, either by investing in professional equipment or taking them to a pro.[3]\n\nUsing a regular whetstone is also not recommended. It's very difficult to get the edge of the recessed blade flush enough with the stone, and you risk ruining the edge by trying. Take them in instead or invest in the right equipment.",
                "Consider getting your shears professionally sharpened. Getting pinking shears professionally sharpened at a fabric store costs $4-$6 dollars, less than the price of a new set, and much less than the cost of a rotary sharpening wheel ($300-$400). It's relatively cheap for the service, very fast, and you'll have the satisfaction of a well-maintained set of shears.\n\n\nIf you're unsure where to get your shears sharpened, go into a fabric store and ask where they get their scissors sharpened. If not there, they should be able to recommend a place in your area that sharpens knives and shears.",
                "Keep your shears well-oiled. A common complaint about pinking shears, especially old ones, is that they take a lot of hand-strength to use. Keep the connection screw well-oiled by adding a little dab of sewing machine oil every now and then when they get sticky. The sewing machine oil is specially made to not stain fabric, so it's a good choice if you're worried about getting your projects dirty.\n\n\nIf you don't want to run out for new oil, you can try a dab of any regular cooking oil, coconut oil being especially effective.",
                "Avoid rust by keeping the shears clean and dry. You shouldn't regularly need to clean your shears, but if you get them dirty make sure you dry them immediately and thoroughly to avoid rusting.\n\n\nTo remove rust, soak the blades for a few minutes in tiny amount of bleach (1 tsp.) in a bucket of water. Scrub them vigorously with a wire scouring pad or a Brillo and clean them with clear water. Dry the shears thoroughly and apply lubricating oil."

        "How to Spot Signs of Inhalant Abuse": {
            "intro": "Inhalant abuse involves inhaling toxic product through the nose or mouth. This process is often referred to as huffing. Inhalants affect the brain similar to alcohol or other drugs. The substance is inhaled into the lungs and absorbed into the bloodstream where the inhaled substance is transported to the brain, causing the feeling of being high or intoxicated. This type of abuse is more common among children or teens, with a study showing that 8th graders more commonly performed inhalant abuse than did 10th and 12th graders.[1] If you are worried about a loved one, there are some ways you can spot the signs of inhalant abuse.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for the behaviors associated with inhalant abuse. There are certain behaviors that may indicate inhalant abuse. These include odd smells of chemicals on your child's breath or in his room. You may also find stashed or hidden paint cans or cleaning materials around his room or around your house. He may also have stains or marks left on his hands, his clothes, or on his face from paint or markers used as inhalants.[2]",
                "Learn the delivery method. There are materials that are associated with the dispersal of inhalants. Inhalant abuse can be done using the inside of a paper or plastic bag, in balloons, or through a saturated cloth.\n\n\nLook for these materials in your child's room or notice if he carries them around.[3]",
                "Notice the behavioral and physical effects. Immediately after inhaling the product, the person experiences a sense of euphoria as well as dizziness or faintness. They will also have incoherent or slurred speaking and poor coordination.[4] Following this initial feeling of being high, many who abuse inhalants will experience:\n\n\nSleepiness\nLack of inhibition\nIrritation\nFaintness\nHallucinations or delusions[5]\n\nNausea\nSlurred speech\nChanges in mood\nDecreased appetite[6]",
                "Recognize long-term behavioral effects. If your child has been abusing inhalants for a long time, there are additional symptoms that might arise. Long-term inhalant abuse can produce apathy, depression, and poor judgment.[7]\n\nBecause inhalants affect the nervous system and increase levels of dopamine, causing great pleasure and reward, inhalant abuse can become habitual and addictive.[8]",
                "Understand long-term medical effects. Long-term inhalant abuse has been linked to a greater risk of STDs, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. There is a link between inhalant abuse and developing tumors as well as a decreased immune system.[9] Additional dangers include bone marrow loss, hearing loss, and heart and lung damage.[10]\n\nIn some cases, inhalant abuse can cause death when the person uses very potent or highly concentrated substance, which causes suffocation or heart attack.[11][12] This has been termed sudden sniffing death. Chemicals that are associated with sudden sniffing death included chemicals from air conditioning coolant, butane, electronic contact cleaners, some aerosols, and propane.[13][14]",
                "Look for volatile solvents. Many inhalants that are abused can be found in the home or office. All inhalants can be grouped into larger categories based on their properties. The first category is volatile solvents, a group of chemicals that originate in a liquid state, but become a gas at room temperature.[15] Products in this group include:\n\n\nPaint thinner\nDegreasing type cleaners\nGasoline\nGlue\nCorrection liquid such as White Out\nMarkers with felt tips such as permanent markers or dry erase markers[16]",
                "Recognize gasses. Another category of inhalants is gases. This group includes products which contain gasses, which are typically under pressure. The hit taken off aerosol gases, such as those found in whip cream, are often referred to as whippets.[17] Common types of gases are:\n\n\nButane tanks\nLighters\nWhipped cream cans\nMedical gasses such as chloroform[18]",
                "Learn about aerosols. A third category of inhalants is aerosols. These chemicals are usually products that are sprayed and can then be inhaled from a bag or rag. These products are sprays such as:\n\n\nHair spray\nSpray paint\nNon-stick sprays such as vegetable oil from a spray can\nKeyboard cleaners in a can[19]",
                "Notice nitrites. The last group of inhalants is known as nitrites. These are a special class of inhalant because they do not affect the nervous system like other inhalants. They work to dilate blood vessels and relax the muscles.[20] Because of this, nitrites are used as sexual enhancers, whereas other inhalants are used to alter mood.\n\n\nNitrites are often called poppers or snappers and are sold in small bottles labeled for other uses, such as, leather cleaner, room deodorizer, or liquid aroma.[21]",
                "Diagnose inhalant abuse. Because inhalant abuse has many harmful effects on the body and brain, many researchers of inhalant abuse suggest that the condition should be treated as a substance use disorder as well as a possible mental health diagnosis. Experts recommend treatment that includes a medical exam to investigate the extent of damage to the nervous system, kidney, liver, heart, and lungs. The doctor will also look for signs of lead poisoning, malnutrition, and signs of reduced intellectual functioning. [22]",
                "Treat inhalant abuse. Treatment facilities such as residential drug treatment are recommended, but it is noted that the typical stay of 28 days to a month is probably not sufficient for inhalant abuse. Researchers suggest that inhalant abuse be treated with a variety of modalities including art therapy, family therapy, activity therapy, and music therapy. [23]\n\nIf a person has become dependent on inhalants, he will need to seek detox treatment, which can usually take 14 to 28 days for inhalants. This is because the chemicals are often deposited into fat stores, meaning it takes longer for them to leave the body.\nIf inhalant abuse is less serious or has not yet become chronic, outpatient treatment and evaluation is beneficial to understand recommendations for therapy or inpatient treatment. [24] Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselors are equipped to evaluate and treat a variety of substance abuse disorders.",
                "Seek immediate medical help. If a loved one is in crisis or shows signs of severe intoxication, such as non-responsiveness, slow or shallow breathing, or has become unconscious, call 911 immediately. [25] He may be going into shock, suffering from a larger issue related to the inhalant abuse, or dropping into sudden sniffing death."

        "wikiHow to Get Ripped Fast": {
            "intro": "For a lot of people, having a lean, sculpted physique ranks pretty high on the list of goals that seem unattainable. Losing weight and building lean muscle are commitments that require a tremendous amount of time, energy and expense, right? Not necessarily. The truth is that there are ways to help your body get rid of the excess weight it’s been holding onto in a relatively short amount of time. All it requires is a little discipline and some practical knowledge of how the body burns fat. By increasing your physical activity, cutting fattening foods out of your diet and making a few small adjustments to your lifestyle, you can maximize your fat-burning potential and finally achieve the ripped body you've always wanted.",
            "steps": [
                "Work out your muscles. Lift weights or perform another type of intense resistance training 3-4 times a week. If you have access to a gym, start with a traditional bodybuilding split (targeting 2-3 muscles groups per session) so that at the end of the week you’ve hit every major muscle group; if you’re working out at home, bodyweight exercises such as push ups, pull ups, air squats and crunches will do just fine. It may seem counterintuitive, but training the muscles actually burns more calories in the long run than spending hours on the treadmill.[1]\n\nGive attention to all of the important muscle groups (legs, back, core, chest, shoulders, arms, etc.) rather than just emphasizing showy muscles like the abs and biceps. Exercises like squats, lunges, rows, dips and shoulder presses that call for a high level of coordination are all excellent for building muscle in different parts of the body.\nThe body constantly uses up calories to maintain muscle tissue, even in a resting state. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you’ll be burning at a given time.[2]",
                "Focus on strength. Use a strength-based approach to program your weight training sessions, performing 4-5 sets of each exercise, with around 5-10 repetitions in each set. Since you’ll be in a reduced calorie state from dieting, too much volume in the gym can actually break down muscle without receiving enough nutrients to repair it. Keeping your volume in check while building and maintaining quality muscle mass is all about shifting your focus from endurance to strength.[3]\n\nYour weight training sessions should be relatively brief (no more than about an hour) and emphasize the major compound lifts (squats, deadlifts and benchpress).[4]\n\nTake 2-3 days off per week to rest and give your body a chance to recover.",
                "Pay attention to your core. Dedicate part of each workout to strengthening and building your core muscles. This could make up the last fifteen minutes of your weight training sessions, or you could add one or two dedicated core sessions each week. These core workouts should be comprised of ab-focused exercises such as weighted sit ups, crunches, leg lifts, planches and suitcase carries. For most people, a ripped physique is synonymous with rippling obliques and a chiseled, defined six-pack. The more your train the muscles of the mid and lower abdomen, the more prominent they will be once you begin to lean out.[5]\n\nYou will also receive some residual core work from the compound lifts you're performing to develop your strength and muscle mass (particularly squats and deadlifts).[6]\n\nLocalized core training will make the ab muscles more noticeable, but to really start looking ripped you should be certain that you're working out your entire body, getting a few hours of cardiovascular training each week and sticking to a reduced-calorie diet. 80% of achieving a lean physique lies in nutrition.",
                "Do regular cardiovascular exercise. In addition to weight training, get in a few hours of steady-state cardio every week. This can include jogging, swimming, cycling, rowing, kickboxing or even simply walking. While resistance training creates a lasting calorie burning effect at rest, cardiovascular training gets you into a consistent fat-burning rhythm. Done together, the two will display great results in no time.[7]\n\nKeep your heart rate elevated, but don’t torture yourself. It’s more important to find a pace and intensity that you can keep up for the duration of the workout.\nFinish your weight training workouts with an hour of cardio. You will have already used up the glycogen in your muscles while lifting weights, so your body will go straight to its fat stores for energy.[8]\n\nExperiment with doing cardio in a fasted state (when you’ve had nothing to eat). For example, go on a short jog first thing in the morning before you eat breakfast. Keep the intensity and length of the workout moderate. Again, with no muscle glycogen to draw from for fuel, you’ll burn pure fat while you exert yourself.[9]",
                "Push yourself with metabolically challenging workouts. A couple times a week, set aside time for a quick Tabata or HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) session. These workouts don’t take long, but are extremely taxing, and can make a big impact on your fat stores. HIIT and other difficult programming methods are known to be metabolically dense, meaning they rev up the mechanisms that burn fat for energy and melt the pounds right off. HIIT programs and similar exercise methods are usually offered at fitness centers in the form of group classes.[10]\n\nTabata-style workouts are done by performing an exercise for 20 seconds, then taking 10 seconds rest. Repeat this sequence 8 times. The entire workout only takes 4 minutes, but you get a ton of bang for your buck.[11]\n\nApps like Tabata Timer and Tabata Stopwatch Pro make it easy to keep track of your activity and rest intervals using your smartphone.[12]\n\nHIIT training involves exercising with a high pace or intensity for a preselected period of time (an “interval”), then dropping the intensity for a short interval before ramping it back up again. [13]",
                "Lower your calorie intake. Keep your diet in check to make sure that you’re not consuming more calories than you’re burning. The simplest and most effective way to do this is to record the approximate number of calories you take in with each meal. When trying to shed fat, it’s best to reduce your daily calories as much as possible while receiving all the necessary nutrients and preserving lean muscle. As long as your net calorie loss through exercise is greater than your intake through eating, you’ll continue to get leaner.[14]\n\nThe number of calories you should be eating will vary person to person, and depends largely on your bodyweight and composition (people with more muscle mass need more calories to maintain it), activity level and other factors.\nTalk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you decide to put yourself on a reduced-calorie diet. An expert will be able to tell you exactly how many calories you'll need to maintain a healthy body composition for your size, age and activity level. They can also provide you with helpful recommendations for food and supplementation.[15]\n\nUse a nutrition app (such as My Fitness Pal, My Diet Coach or Lose It!) or an old-fashioned journal to record the number of calories you consume on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to make sure you're on track to meet your goals.[16]",
                "Eat high protein, low fat foods. Reconfigure your personal food pyramid so that foods that are rich in protein comprise a bigger part of your diet. At the same time, drastically cut down on greasy, high-fat foods, or eliminate them altogether. High-fat foods are richer with calories, meaning it won’t take much of them to sabotage your nutrition plan. Lean, protein-packed foods, however, contain few calories on average. Their protein content will help you build valuable, calorie-incinerating muscle mass, as well as keep you feeling full longer.[17]\n\nGet your protein from sources like lean meats, eggs, beans, tofu, nuts, etc. Stay away from fried foods, chips and other snack foods.\nA good general guideline is to get at least 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your bodyweight: if you weight 150lbs, for instance, you should aim for around 75g of protein a day.[18]\n\nSupplementing with protein bars or shakes can help you meet your daily protein needs without requiring you to eat every couple of hours.",
                "Choose natural, whole food options. Ditch the fast food, TV dinners and other processed junk and stick to fresh, natural foods. Whole grains, green leafy vegetables, raw nuts and fresh fruit should all be staples of your overhauled diet. They’re full of the macronutrients your body craves and uses to build a ripped, strong physique. They’re also devoid of chemical preservatives and other unknowns which can make it hard for your body to digest and break down food for energy.[19]\n\nOrganic foods can be a little more expensive, but they’re worth the benefits they offer you. Each meal will leave you feeling satisfied.\nDo your shopping and meal preparation in advance. That way you’ll know exactly what’s in the food you eat—you’ll be better able to keep track of calories and other nutrients, and having food on hand when you get hungry will keep you from seeking out unhealthy options.[20]",
                "Limit sweets. Now is the time to give up candy, donuts and other tempting confections. Nothing stalls fat-burning progress faster than sugar-laden foods. While sugar is useful for provided instant, short-term energy, most of it ends up stored as fatty tissue if it’s not used for fuel immediately. For best results, keep your sugar intake down to or below about 50g per day.[21] If you must have something sweet, opt for a ripe banana, a handful of wild berries or a filling snack like Greek yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey.[22]\n\nBe careful with the amount of bottled juices and even fresh fruit you consume. While it’s better to get your sugar from natural sources, it can add up after a while.\nExamine food packaging closely at the supermarket. Even non-dessert foods are often saturated with sugar.",
                "Get plenty of rest. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night whenever possible. Your body repairs itself and builds new tissue while at rest. This is when the muscle mass you’ve been working so hard to pack on will begin developing. A good night’s sleep will also help you recover from fatigue, injury and soreness, and leave you feeling refreshed and ready for your next workout.[23]\n\nTurn off the TV, stereo, phone, tablet and any other electronic distractions when you go to bed to ensure that you fall into a deep, restful sleep.[24]\n\nIf you have trouble getting enough uninterrupted sleep at night, try taking a nap for 20-30 minutes in the afternoon or whenever you have time.",
                "Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially during intense exercise to replenish what is lost through perspiration. Every cell in your body contains water, so needless to say it’s vital for proper growth and function. You’ll feel more energetic when you’re adequately hydrated, and water can even help curb your appetite when you start getting cravings for unhealthy foods.[25]\n\nWater should replace sodas, sports drinks, alcohol and other beverages that are filled with carbohydrates from sugar.\nAs a general rule, you should drink when you feel thirsty. Try to get at least ½ to ¾ of a gallon of water per day. When you use the restroom, your urine should be very light in color or clear.[26]",
                "Drink black coffee and green tea. Put on a pot of coffee when you first wake up, or unwind at night with a steaming mug of organic green tea. Coffee beans and tea leaves are renowned for their antioxidant properties, which reduce inflammation in the body, fighting age-related illness and obesity. The caffeine and other components of tea and coffee have even been observed to have a slight thermogenic effect, meaning that sipping them can actually help you destroy fat cells.[27]\n\nLeave the cream and sugar out of your coffee and/or tea. This just adds unneeded calories.",
                "Try intermittent fasting. We’re often told that in order to lose weight, we should eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. In reality, this just makes it more likely for calories to stack up and exceed your daily limit. As an alternative, try fasting for 8-10 hours at a time 1 or 2 days a week. Fasting periodically works to suppress your appetite and reset your body’s natural hormone levels. Plus, since you aren’t eating, you’ll be burning calories all that time, giving you an advantage when it comes to staying in a caloric deficit.[28]\n\nTo begin intermittent fasting, simply have breakfast as usual, then don’t eat again for 8-10 hours. Alternately, you can begin fasting as soon as you wake up, eating your first meal around mid-afternoon or early evening.\nFasting is perfectly safe, as long as it doesn’t turn into starvation. Make sure you eat at least one substantial meal on fasting days to break the fast. High-protein, moderate-fat and carbohydrate meals are perfect for this purpose.[29]\n\nSit down with a physician or nutritionist before experimenting with intermittent fasting. Discuss which nutrient timing schedules and frequencies would be most advantageous for you. Fasting may not be a beneficial practice for everyone, especially those with hormone or metabolic disorders.[30]"

            "intro": "Have you felt the tug of the Spirit and Love on your life? If you believe in Jesus Christ, as your Lord and Savior, you begin to live in Christ by \"grace through faith, saved unto good works\". Faith is an essential part of your personal life: as when you have faith in people to drive at 70 mph in two-way traffic with perhaps only a stripe separating you from a head on collision.\nFaith in God is not at all as scary as that example. If you have chosen to become a Christian, but you don't know whether there is more to do or not, this article will shed some light on receiving your new life and living in God's love.\nBecoming a Christian is easy and does not require any rites or rituals, though some churches have classes and confirmation by a pastor or priest. Your new beginning in your new birth, however, leads into the personal development of serving others and living in Christ as discussed below.",
            "steps": [
                "See your need of Jesus. Take a look at the Ten Commandments for a moment. Have you ever lied? Blasphemed? Stolen (even something small)? Looked at someone with adulterous or lustful feelings? In Christianity, we are born with original sin, and act as sinners through our lives, even after accepting Jesus: as Jesus said, \"If you look upon a woman to lust, then you are guilty of adultery already\" (Matthew 5:27-28). He who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. ( 1 John 3:15). You have to face God on judgment day to give an account of your sins. If you die in your sins, God has to send you away from Himself to Hell, called the second death, for transgressing His law.\n\n\nRealize, however, that He sent Jesus to give Himself willingly on the cross and so: If you believe, receive the Holy Spirit, and repent of your sins, then after you are saved, you will also serve others as if it is to God himself.\nAs Son of Man, Jesus said, \"Father, if it is your will, let this bitter cup pass from me -- nevertheless, 'not my will but thine be done'.\", giving Himself freely as the sacrifice for you so that you may now turn, \"repent (change your mind) therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out/wiped away, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;\" (Acts 3:19)[1]",
                "Believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins. Believe, further, that Jesus died and rose again from the dead to pay the penalty for your sins and make you right with God. Believe the basic doctrine of Christ's redemptive death and resurrection",
                "Repent which means, \"turn to God\" for salvation. Verbalize your belief in Jesus' forgiveness and your regret for all the ways you have fallen short of His holiness. This is a good time to admit your personal failure and disobedience to God. Believe that Jesus Christ forgives you. Repentance always expresses itself in a changed life; you turn from sin and to Jesus Christ; then, accept your free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus' redemptive death through grace from God.\n\n\nExpress reliance upon God: Specifically, confess your spiritual need and acknowledge for yourself Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Christian Step 4\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/13/Be-a-Christian-Step-4.jpg/aid192151-v4-728px-Be-a-Christian-Step-4.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nYou need the Gospel of Christ: The good news of Jesus Christ, that you broke His Law but Christ took your punishment, paying your sin-fine. It is not earned, it is strictly given by God's grace. He grants us repentance and faith in His Son in order to save us from Hell.\nLearn the difference between churches of the Gospel. Choose a Christian meeting to attend and fellowship. Consider and decide on the Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Nondenominational, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Mormon, etc. denominations in order to decide which one is the Church that Christ started, the \"Pillar and Foundation of Truth\" .\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Christian Step 5\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/78/Be-a-Christian-Step-5.jpg/aid192151-v4-728px-Be-a-Christian-Step-5.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Find community and assembly with other Christians. We cannot walk alone in life. It is important that as a Christian you find a group of supportive and seasoned Christian believers who can help you and encourage you in your new faith and continuing trust in God. You may find it helpful to talk to a Christian. Choose someone that you respect for his or her integrity and knowledge as a Christian.",
                "Be baptised. Baptism is about coming into the community of Christ. This is the second step of salvation, after repentance. It may be thought of as a self portrait of your joining with Christ in the death and resurrection in your heart (core of your being) and in the eye of the observer. “Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”[2] Baptism was described by the apostle Paul as: \"Therefore we are planted together (united) with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\"[3]\n\nContinue your walk . After you have accepted Christ by receiving the Holy Spirit, fellowship with Him in your daily life by praying, reading the Bible, and following Christ's example.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Be a Christian Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Be-a-Christian-Step-8.jpg/aid192151-v4-728px-Be-a-Christian-Step-8.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Love Jesus and love others with the love that Jesus gives you. These things reflect your changed heart, and love one of the most important aspects of a Christian life.\n\n\nBe truthful to God and Jesus. Truly repent of your actions and thought, and seek, then accept God's love and His plan and then be saved by His grace. It's really bad for you to not confess, repent and to be saved, but if you are not, you will then die in Hell (and nobody ever wants that to happen). If you ever want to see your friends and family in Heaven and to tell them all about your life. Well, isn't that what you want?",
                "Be amazed when you understand what Ephesians 2:8--10 says:[4]\n\"\"8. For it is \"by grace\" you have been saved, \"through faith\"--\nand this \"not of yourselves\", it is the \"gift of God\"--\n9. \"not by works\", so that no one can boast.\n10. For we are God's workmanship\n\"created\" in Christ Jesus \"to do good works\",\nwhich God prepared in advance for us to do.\"(Ephesians 2:8--10) So if you are saved, live to do good to others, according to God's law of love...",
                "Read the Holy Bible as much as possible. Then you will begin to understand what you need to do with your walk with the Lord. In order to become a Christian, you need to grow in Christ:",
                "Learn about Jesus and believe that He died, rose from the dead as your Savior and then pray for repentance to the one, true God repenting, similar to: \"Father, God, I turn from my sin, all my wrong doing; I want to change, and I truly thank you for everything you have done and that I am now freely forgiven and saved from the penalty for my sins -- as a free gift, and you do place a new life in me. Thank you for your gift for me of receiving The Holy Spirit in Jesus' name.\"",
                "Walk in love; follow Jesus, telling others that \"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\" (1 Timothy 2:5) the Son of God, who is Lord and Savior for everyone who believes, repents and follows Him, and, yes, you must follow -- and so, (walk in the Spirit):\"\"Following Jesus Christ\" will include going to Christian meetings with people of like faith, being Baptised, in the name of the Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit, as a sign of accepting your new life, praying to God, reading the Bible, and showing God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, having a faithful, loving relationship with believers (don't live by feelings; judge no one harshly, not even yourself; live and walk in Christ's Spirit, The Spirit of God, in faith, hope and charity. So, live in the Spirit and no one can snatch you out of Jesus' hands and The Father's hands; that is safety, secured.) But, when you (in your mind) are convicted of sin, expecting consequences for it, ask for forgiveness (so that you can be forgiven), and you can keep on living as a Child of God, all in Christ Jesus' name -- with God as the one, true Judge of all things both good and bad. God's love is perfect and casts out all fear."

            "intro": "Cleopatra was famous not just for being a queen of ancient Egypt, but also for being remarkably beautiful and smart. She was also well known for taking her milk baths, which she often infused with honey or herbs. She was wise to do so; milk is great for the skin. It is both moisturizing and exfoliating. It leaves skin feeling silky soft, with a healthy glow.",
            "steps": [
                "Fill a large jar with 1 to 2 cups (240 to 475 milliliters) of milk. Try to use whole milk. It will be more exfoliating and moisturizing than low-fat or nonfat milk.[4]",
                "Add ½ cup (175 grams) honey for extra moisture. Honey is also antibacterial, and great at reducing acne.",
                "Close the jar and shake it to mix. If necessary, open the jar, and stir the milk and honey with a spoon. You want the honey to dissolve in the milk, and not settle at the bottom.",
                "Plug your bath tub and start filling it with warm water. Avoid using water that is too hot, or it will destroy the beneficial properties of the honey.",
                "Pour the milk and honey mixture under the running water. Once the tub is full to your liking, turn the water off, and swish it with your hand to combine the milk-and-honey mixture.",
                "Get into the tub, and soak for no more than 20 minutes. Do not use any soap in this bath. When you are done soaking, drain the bath water, and rinse yourself off using soap and fresh water.[5]",
                "Fill a glass jar with the powdered milk. Try to use the full-fat variety, as it will be more beneficial for your skin than the low-fat or nonfat kind. Do not add water to the milk yet.",
                "Add the dried orange peel, lavender flowers, and rosemary. These will give the bath water a soothing, fragrant aroma. You can also experiment with using other types of flowers and herbs, such as dried rose or lily petals.[6]",

When you are done, empty the tub and rinse your body off using soap and fresh water.\n\n\nConsider using a strainer to catch the dried orange peel and flower petals before you empty the tub. This way, you won't risk clogging your drain.",

Which ever milk you decide to use, try to use a full-fat variety. It will be more moisturizing for your skin than the low-fat or nonfat kind.",
                "Add the honey crystals to the jar. You can also use honey powder instead. Using dry honey instead of liquid honey will make it easier to mix into the milk powder.[10] You also won't have to store it in the fridge.",
                "Grind the oatmeal into a fine powder and add it to the jar. You can use a blender or a coffee grinder. This will make the milk bath easier to use, and will prevent your drain from getting clogged.",
                "Grind the lavender flowers into a fine powder and add them to the jar. You can do this using a mortar and pestle, or a coffee grinder. If you don't like lavender, try another type of dried flower, such as chamomile, rose, or lily.[11]",
                "Consider adding 10 to 20 drops of your favorite essential oil for additional fragrance.[12] If you are using more than one type of oil, mix them in a separate bottle first. You can use any type of oil you'd like, but scents that go well with milk and honey baths include: geranium, lavender, mandarin, and ylang ylang.[13]",

When you are done, drain the tub, and rinse yourself off with soap and fresh water.\n\n\nTo get the most out of the bath's fragrance, consider closing the bathroom door so that the aromas don't escape."

        "wikiHow to Calm a Rabbit": {
            "intro": "Rabbits are shy and nervous little creatures. Because they are hunted in the wild by animals and people, they will need a lot of encouragement and socialization to become friendly. This tutorial will tell you what to look for and how to act when Mister bunny is upset.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the clues. Your pet might not know how to speak but it will give you important visual clues when upset. These clues are subtle and you will need to be observant and know your animal’s usual behaviour to spot the signs of agitation or fear. Look for the following:[1]\n\nHiding in its den and refusing to get out.\nA sudden change of behaviour. Your rabbit becomes aggressive or wants to hide.\nChewing the bars of its cage.\nOver-grooming or changing its toileting habits.\nOver-eating and over-drinking.\nRefusing to move or circling its cage.\nStomping his/her hind legs\nWide eyes",
                "Check for predators. Your rabbit is usually upset for a good reason. It doesn’t want to be turned into a meal! Cats and dogs can kill a rabbit easily and should be kept away.[2] There are many other animals, depending on where you live, which constitute a danger for your pet.\n\n\nThe most common predators, aside cats and dogs, are foxes, ferrets and all birds of prey.[3]\n\nRabbits have an excellent sense of smell.[4] They might identify a danger before you. If you’re outside with your rabbit and (s)he looks afraid, don’t take any chance. Take your rabbit in your arms and place him/her in a safe place.\nIf your rabbit has been chased by another animal, bring him/her to safety and reassure him/her.",
                "Adjust their environment. Rabbits are herbivores and are not equipped to fight back hunters.[5] Their strategy is to hide as quickly as possible in a dark and secured place. You need to make sure that they can access a safe place at all times.[6]\n\nHave an artificial tunnel in the cage and/or in the room where the rabbit plays. You can find one in a good pet shop. A cardboard box that is larger than your rabbit makes a good hidey too.\nIf they go out, make sure that they have a place to hide but don’t let them escape.",
                "Adapt your behavior. Your rabbit is a fragile animal and is easily scared. Your voice or the screams of your children might be interpreted as a danger by the animal. Rapid movements are often mistaken for a predator’s attack.\n\n\nNever scream at the rabbit. It will be terrified and may mistrust you in the future.\nSome rabbits liked to be carried, others hate it. If you can’t make your animal relaxed in your arms, leave him/her alone.\nIf it's essential to pick the rabbit up, such as to remove it from harm, then hold the rabbit in a towel to avoid getting your arms scratched and to help the rabbit feel safe.\nRabbits are easily overwhelmed if there are too many people in the same room.\nAvoid loud music and flashing lights. Your rabbit needs peace and quiet.\nOn the other hand, if your rabbit is scared, play some calming classical music. This will help them to calm down and feel more at rest.",
                "Offer physical reassurance. Gently hold your rabbit and pet it. Stroke the rabbit's head on the top, near the base of its ears. Keep your fingers at the top of the rabbit's head so it cannot nip you. Speak to the rabbit soothingly and kindly.\n\n\nTry to establish a regular routine of petting and talking to your rabbit.\nRemember that some rabbits dislike being stroked on the nose, belly or underneath their chin.\nCovering the rabbit's eyes can help reduce fear. While stroking the rabbit, gently cover its eyes with your hands. However, some rabbits don't like this. If your rabbit doesn’t quiet down after a few minutes, slowly remove your hand.\nIf your rabbit is scared from loud noises around you, cover your rabbit's ears with your hand while stroking him/her or covering his/her eyes.",
                "Entertain your rabbit. If your rabbit is nervous, give it its favourite toy and play hard. Agitation can be a sign of boredom or lack of intellectual stimulation.[7]\n\nGive a piece of rabbit wood bought at the pet shop. Your animal will be very tempted to chew it and it's excellent for its teeth.\nIf the rabbit doesn’t show any interest for the game, stop after a few minutes and look for what’s stressing it.",
                "Offer your rabbit a treat. Bunnies can rarely resist a piece of fruit or a slice of carrot. If your rabbit is scared, give him/her their favorite food to calm them. Don’t do it too often to avoid obesity.[8]\n\nPut a small piece of fruit on your hand and approach your rabbit gently. The rabbit will slowly understand that humans can be trusted.\nNever offer them sweets or bread. Avoid tomato leaves and potatoes. They are highly toxic for rabbits.",
                "Go to the veterinarian. If there is no apparent danger and you have tried everything to quiet your rabbit down, take him/her to a professional for help. Your rabbit might be ill and would benefit from a check-up.\n\n\nAsk your veterinarian to make a visit to your house. There is no need to add more stress to your rabbit with a car ride.\nDon't medicate your rabbit without having consulted a specialist. You might kill your animal.\nIf you have more than one pet, quarantine the agitated rabbit to avoid contagion.\nWash your hands and take care of your personal hygiene. If you haven't been vaccinated against rabies and have been bitten by your rabbit, immediately go to the hospital.[9]\n\nAlso wash your hands before handling the rabbit to get rid of the smell of cats, dogs, or other animals you have touched which predate on rabbits."

        "wikiHow to Baker Act Someone": {
            "intro": "To Baker Act someone means that you initiate the process for an involuntary and emergency psychiatric examination of a person with a mental illness at a Florida hospital or crisis unit. This refers to a specific Florida law and it only applies to proceedings within the state of Florida. Other states have their own rules and proceedings concerning involuntary psychiatric care.",
            "steps": [
                "Educate yourself about the Baker Act. The Baker Act, also known as the Florida Mental Health Act (Florida Statute Chapter 394, Part I) is a law that was passed to ensure and regulate emergency mental health treatment services for those suffering from a mental illness. This law is meant to protect all people with serious mental illnesses in the State of Florida.[1]\n\nThe Baker Act provides procedures to guide both voluntary admissions and involuntary examinations of people suffering from a mental illness.\nThe Act also provides procedures for the involuntary inpatient placement (civil commitment) for someone suffering a mental health crisis.\nThe Act also provides for involuntary outpatient placement for individuals ordered by a Florida court to receive mental health treatment services as an outpatient.[2]\n\nThe Act sets forth a patient’s bill of rights, mandates attorney representation for those undergoing involuntary placement proceedings, and prohibits discriminatory admission and retention of individuals without just cause.[3]",
                "Review the patient’s bill of rights. If you are concerned about a loved one’s mental health status but unsure whether they will be protected within Florida’s mental health system, you should review the patient’s bill of rights as set forth in the Baker Act located at http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0394/0394.html. These rights include:\n\n\nThe right to respect and protection of constitutional rights, including the right to petition the court (habeas corpus) to challenge the legality of being held at a mental health facility.\nThe right to receive quality treatment regardless of the patient’s ability to pay.\nThe right to be informed about the risks and benefits of treatment, and the reasons for treatment and hospitalization.\nThe right to communicate privately with people outside of the facility and immediate access to a patient’s family.\nThe right to vote in elections, if eligible to vote.\nThe right to access a phone to report violations of the patient’s bill of rights or abuse and the right to have violations reported on behalf of the patient.\nThe right to participate in treatment and discharge planning.[4]",
                "Understand the requirements for voluntary admission under the Baker Act. The Baker Act provides procedures for individuals who are18 years old and older to apply voluntarily for admission to a psychiatric facility or for individuals 17 or under whose parents or guardians apply for admission on the minor’s behalf.\n\n\nFor a person 18 or older, they can be voluntarily admitted if a medical provider finds evidence of mental illness, they are competent to provide express and informed consent and they are suitable for treatment.\nA minor 17 or younger can only be admitted after a hearing is held to verify the that the consent was voluntary.\nA person who requests voluntary discharge or revokes consent must be discharged unless involuntary status is sought and approved. (§394.4625, Fla. Stat.)[5]",
                "Know the criteria for an involuntary examination under the Baker Act. For an involuntary examination, a person may be taken to a psychiatric facility if they meet the following criteria:\n\n\nThere is reason to believe that the person has a mental illness; and\nThe mental illness has caused the person to refuse a voluntary examination after the purpose of the examination was explained; or\nThe mental illness has caused the person be unable to determine whether an examination is necessary; and\nWithout receiving proper care and treatment, the person may suffer from neglect, represents a real and present threat to his/her well-being; and it is not clear that this harm can be avoided with the intervention of family and/or friends; or\nWithout treatment there is a substantial likelihood that the person will hurt himself or others in the near future.(§394.463, Fla. Stat.)[6]",
                "Ask a legal or medical official to initiate an involuntary examination. The following people can initiate an involuntary examination:\n\n\nA court can enter an ex parte order (order for the benefit of one party) stating that the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination. The court may hear sworn testimony on the subject and must set forth the findings on which the court based its conclusion.\nA police officer can take a person into custody and deliver them to a psychiatric facility for examination if the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination.\nA physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatric nurse, mental health counselor, marriage and family therapist, or clinical social worker can execute a certificate, which states that the mental health care provider examined the person in question within the preceding 48 hours and that the person appears to meet the criteria for involuntary examination. The healthcare provider must also set forth the reasons supporting his/her conclusions.(§394.463, Fla. Stat.)[7]",
                "Watch the individual for signs of mental illness. Monitor the behavior and mental state of the person about whom you are concerned. In order for the Baker Act to be relevant, the person must be suffering from a mental illness, which is defined under Florida law as:\n\n\nAn “impairment of the mental or emotional processes that exercise conscious control of one’s actions or of the ability to perceive or understand reality.”\nThe impairment “substantially interferes with the person’s ability to meet the ordinary demands of living.”\nMental illness “does not include developmental disability, intoxication, or conditions manifested only by antisocial behavior or substance abuse impairment.”(§394.455(18), Fla. Stat.)[8]",
                "Talk to your loved one about voluntary admission. If the person with a mental illness is a loved one and appears to be in a lucid state, consider asking them to seek help at a psychiatric facility. When discussing this topic, consider the following:\n\n\nStress how worried you are about your loved one.\nExplain that with a voluntary admission, they can revoke they their consent and must be discharged unless the doctors find they are suffering from a mental illness, can’t make their own decisions about treatment and/or appear to be a substantial harm to themselves or others.\nApproach the topic in a non-threatening manner and back off if the individual becomes violent or shows signs of distress accompanied by adamant refusal.",
                "Talk to a mental health professional who can diagnose and treat your loved one. If your loved one is already under the care of a mental health professional and you are concerned about a change in behavior or the manifestation of a mental illness, contact your loved one’s doctor and discuss the new behavior.[9]\n\nThe doctor may try to reach out to their patient to assess the situation.\nIf after examining the patient, the mental health professional feels that the individual meets the criteria for an involuntary examination, then they may initiate the process under the Baker Act.\nThe mental health professional or caseworker will then need to execute a certificate stating that the examination has taken place within the past 48 hours.\nAny certificate issued will be sent to local law enforcement. From there, a law enforcement officer will take the named patient to the nearest receiving facility.",
                "File an ExParte Petition for Involuntary Examination with the court. If your family member with a mental illness refuses to speak with a mental healthcare professional, and you believe that they meet the criteria for involuntary examination, you can file an ExParte Petition for Involuntary Examination with the court. You can download the petition form here: www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/MentalHealth/laws/3002.doc. As part of the petition, you must include the following information:\n\n\nYour name, home address, occupation and work address.\nThe name, address, and identifying information for the person for whom you are requesting an involuntary examination.\nA description of your relationship with the person for whom you are requesting an involuntary examination, such as: whether you are family members; whether you are on good terms; how long you have known each other; whether you have ever called the police on the person and why; and whether you have ever gone to court related to the person and why.\nA description of the concerning behavior and whether the behavior was caused by intoxication and not a mental illness.\nA description of why you believe the person has a mental illness, whether you believe they are at risk for substantial harm to themselves or others, and whether you tried to secure voluntary mental health services for the person.[10]",
                "Get help directly from the police. If your loved one is in need of urgent care and you are concerned that they are in immediate danger, you can call your local law enforcement and inform them of the situation. An officer can take a person who displays outward signs of the necessary criteria to a receiving facility for an examination.\n\n\nThis is usually done in cases where no time can be wasted. For instance, if someone has attempted suicide or is threatening suicide, self-harm, or harm to another individual, you should call the police instead of resorting to another method.",
                "Be aware that the involuntary examination is temporary. Under the Baker Act, the person taken for an involuntary examination will be seen at the nearest mental health receiving facility. Under the Baker Act, the facility will gain custody of the individual but that custody will only last for 72 hours.[11]\n\nUpon admission, the patient will receive a mental health examination and any emergency treatment necessary to stabilize his/her immediate condition.\nWithin 72 hours, the patient must be released or the facility must file a petition for involuntary placement.\nA psychiatrist or clinical psychologist must approve the patient’s release.",
                "Learn about Involuntary Inpatient Placement (IIP). If the situation proves serious enough after the initial exam, the mental health facility might petition to place the patient under IIP.\n\n\nIIP is the same thing as civil commitment. The individual will be admitted for further mental health treatment beyond stabilization of the mental health crisis and without the patient’s consent.\nThe patient must meet criteria similar to the criteria for involuntary examination.\nThe IPP must be supported by a psychiatrist and must also be backed by a second psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist.\nAfter reviewing the petition and hearing medical testimony, a court can order IIP.\nA court can order an IIP for up to six months, and the stay can be extended after additional court hearings.\nThe patient will receive treatment at a state mental health treatment facility or at a short-term residential treatment facility.[12]",
                "Learn about Involuntary Outpatient Placement (IOP). IOP is less common than IIP. This is a form of commitment, pursuant to a court order, whereby a patient seeks mental health treatment on an outpatient basis.[13]",
                "Show your support. Recovery from mental illness is very difficult and your loved one will need compassion and support during the entire process.\n\n\nContinue to show support during any court-ordered treatment and after that treatment has concluded.\nIf you suspect that the problem is returning, address those concerns appropriately by discussing them with the individual in question or by consulting a mental health professional."

            "intro": "It can be frustrating to have someone you care about be upset. If your friend, girlfriend, or sister is really angry, anxious, or sad, you probably want to know how to help her calm down. Learn how to calm a girl down by relaxing her, offering your support, or talking it over.",
            "steps": [
                "Breathe deeply with her. When you see her struggling to calm down on her own, lead her into a deep breathing exercise that promotes the natural relaxation response. To practice deep breathing:[1]\n\nFind a quiet, comfortable place in which the two of you can sit without distractions. Either sit up straight with a cushion or use a chair for support. Relax your shoulders and rest your hands on your thighs.\nBoth of you should place one hand on your chest and one on your abdomen. Breathe in deeply through your nose for 4 to 8 counts. The hand on your abdomen should expand with your belly. Hold the breath briefly, for 1 to 2 counts. Then, release the air out through your mouth, watching your hand fall with your belly, for the same number of counts as the inhale. The hand on your chest should move very little.\nRepeat the inhale-exhale process for 5 to 10 min, or until she becomes more relaxed.",
                "Do progressive muscle relaxation.[2] Another technique you can try to get her to loosen up and relax is progressive muscle relaxation. This exercise helps you to notice where you are holding tension in your body and know what relaxation feels like in these tense areas.\n\n\nGrab comfortable seats in chairs or on the sofa. Start with a few minutes of deep breathing to stimulate calm.\nStart at your feet and move up. Notice how your feet feel. Take several seconds to become aware of this feeling. Then, gradually contract the muscles in your feet until they are extremely tense. Hold for 10 counts. Release the tension, taking note of how it simply melts away. Stay in this state for about 10 counts, continuing to breath deeply.\nMove slowly up through the body contracting and releasing each muscle group.",
                "Get some exercise. The intensity of working out may not immediately come to mind when thinking of way to help calm someone down, but physical activity is a terrific way to relieve stress and promote a positive mood. Exercise generates those feel-good chemicals in the brain called endorphins that tend to make you feel more energetic and brighter about life.[3]\n\nIf you see her having a tough day, steer her towards a group fitness class like Zumba to get moving and form social connections.[4] Other ideas include running, walking, yoga, playing basketball, swimming, and hiking.",
                "Do a guided imagery exercise together. Guided imagery or visualization is another approach that promotes the body's natural relaxation response. This practice can be carried out by listening to an audiotape or following along to a YouTube video. Here's how it works:[5]\n\nFind a quiet, serene place to listen to a guided visualization exercise or choose to use your own minds. The idea is start by deep breathing. Then, begin visualizing a place that makes each of you feel safe or happy, such as grandma's house, the local water hole, or an exotic beach.\nUse at least three of your senses to envision this place. Don't just stop at how it looks in your mind. Also, bring to mind how it smells (e.g. freshly baked cookies or coconut) or tastes (e.g. chocolate chips or salty air). Move deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation as you take in the sensations and surroundings of your special place.",
                "Listen to soothing music. Research shows that classical music is especially effective at producing a calming state of mind.[6] However, it really depends on her, maybe she just wants to forget her problems temporarily and shake her hips to a tribal drum beat. Or, she may want to commiserate by listening to songs that describe her feelings.\n\n\nAs long as it's relaxing to her, it doesn't matter what type of music it is.[7]",
                "Avoid saying \"calm down\". When she's upset and shouting at the top of her lungs, the last thing you want to say is \"calm down\". Although calming her down may, indeed, be your focus, those two words actually have the power to rile her up even more. In addition, saying this can make her think you are minimizing or dismissing her feelings.[8]\n\nInstead, try something like this: \"I can see you're upset/frustrated/anxious...what can I do?\" or \"I can't make out what you're saying. Let's take a few deep breaths and start over\".",
                "Offer help. If you see her all hung up over something that's getting her down, ask what you can do to take the burden away, even temporarily. Maybe she would like you to help her with a project at school or a chore around the house. She may even just like to go to lunch or take a walk to the park with you.",
                "Make her smile. One way to take her mind off what's stressing her is to change her perspective. Do something to make her smile. Tell her a joke or watch a funny video or movie together. Splurge and buy her that new book/pair of earrings she's been wanting. [9]",
                "Offer physical touch. Human touch has amazing calming properties. Since touch is one of our earliest and most basic forms of communication, mostly everyone responds to it. Physical touch in the form of hugs, a caress, a pat on the back, or hand-holding can offer comfort that perhaps words cannot. Physical touch has been shown to lower stress, improve health outcomes, and lift mood.[10][11]\n\nAsk her if it's okay, then give her a hug, rub her back or shoulders, or hold her hand. This seemingly small physical connection with you might be just what she needs to calm down.",
                "Wait until she is ready. When we see those we care about in trouble or pain, we instantly want to fix the situation. Overcome the urge to \"fix\" her problem or rush her into talking about it. The best case scenario is to just be there. When she's ready to talk, she will.[12]",
                "Listen actively. The best listeners don't listen to reply, they listen to understand. Active listening is the process of focusing your attention on her message and responding so that you can achieve mutual understanding.[13] Active listening involves four key principles:[14]\n\nSeek to understand before being understood. You must collect information about what she is saying before you can adequately provide a response to her.\nBe non-judgmental. Refrain from expressing any judgment about her circumstances. Demonstrate unconditional positive regard and emotional intelligence. You can be with, talk to and provide support without necessarily agreeing with everything she says.\nProvide undivided attention. Make eye contact within a ratio that feels comfortable to you, typically about 70% of the time you're listening (about 50% when you're speaking).[15] Turn off your phone. Turn to face her with your arms and legs uncrossed.\nMake appropriate use of silence. Sit quietly no matter how much you would like to interrupt. She may have an important revelation that never comes out because of an untimely interruption. Offer feedback by nodding, smiling, or saying short remarks such as \"Umm hmm\" or \"Go on\" to let her know you're listening.",
                "Validate her feelings. More than likely, if she is overwhelmed by stress or emotion, she may just want to feel heard and accepted. When loved ones are upset it can be terribly easy to overlook their core feelings in an effort to resolve the situation. When she calms down a bit, ask her to describe her feelings to you without minimizing her circumstances or offering unsolicited advice.[16][17] Helpful validating statements may sound like:\n\n\n\"Aww, that sounds terrible.\"\n\"I'm so sorry you're having such a tough time.\"\n\"I can see why you're upset. That doesn't sound fair.\"",
                "Help her problem-solve. Only after actively listening to and validating her feelings may you move into the resolution stage. And, still, you should only try to help her with the situation if she expressly asks for your help. Otherwise, your job is done. If she asks for advice or help solving an issue, work together.\n\n\nClearly define the problem. Then, ask her ideally what she would like the end result to be. Once you've identified her goals, then outline a list of possible solutions that can meet them. Go over each solution aloud and consider the pros and cons of each. Allow her to make the final decision. Remember, you are there to be a source of support, not to take over her life.\nIf her problem is too big for you to help with alone, offer to go with her to talk to her parents, another adult, the school counselor, or a professional counselor."

        "How to Grow Passion Fruit": {
            "intro": "If you live in a warm climate and do not experience harsh winters, you can grow tropical passion fruit at home. The plant can be a little finicky and needs room to spread out, but with enough attention and care, it will provide you with a steady yield of delicious fruit.",
            "steps": [
                "Use fresh seeds. Freshly harvested passion fruit seeds germinate quickly, but older, dry seeds can take months to germinate if they grow at all.[1]\n\nA few days before you intend to plant the seed, buy ripe passion fruit from the store. Open it and collect at least half a dozen seeds.\nSpread the seeds out onto burlap and rub them until the juice sacs burst open.\nWash the seeds in water, and allow them to dry for three to four days before washing them again and drying them in the shade.\nIf you plant the seeds immediately, they should germinate within 10 to 20 days.\nIf you need to store the seeds, place them in airtight plastic bags and refrigerate them for up to six months.",
                "Prepare a nursery container. Ideally, you should start passion fruit vines in a separate, protected container and later transplant them to your prepared garden spot. Choose a container that is no larger than 1 square yard (90 square centimeters).\n\n\nFill the container with a soil mixture made from equal parts compost, topsoil, and coarse sand. Fill the container with 4 inches (10 cm) of this mixture.",
                "Dig shallow furrows. Scrape a stick through the soil in your nursery container, spacing the resulting furrows 2 inches (5 cm) apart.\n\n\nThese furrows will serve as shallow drains that can help prevent moisture from drowning the seeds or their budding roots.",
                "Sow the seeds. Place the seeds 1/2 inch (1 cm) apart from one another inside each furrow. Protect the seeds by covering them with a very thin layer of your soil mixture.\n\n\nImmediately water after planting the seeds. Moisten the soil, but do not drench it.\nAfter planting the seeds, all you need to do is provide an occasional sprinkle of water when the surface of the soil dries out.",
                "Transplant the seedlings. When the seedlings grow to a height of 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm), they are ready to be transplanted into a permanent location in your garden.",
                "Prepare a sand bed. Fill a plastic flower pot with a mixture made of three parts agricultural sand and one part topsoil. Mix the soil components well so that they are evenly dispersed throughout the container.\n\n\nCuttings get most of the moisture they need to grow from humidity since they do not have roots at this point. As such, you do not want to use a soil that will retain a lot of moisture.",
                "Take a cutting.[2] Choose a mature, healthy passion fruit plant to take a cutting from. Snip off a portion of the vine that contains at least three buds, if not more, and cut directly below the lowest bud.\n\n\nNewer growth is more active, so it is recommended that you choose a newer portion of vine rather than and older portion.\nImmediately plant this cutting into your sand bed.",
                "Keep the cutting in humid conditions. The best place for a vine cutting is a greenhouse. If you do not have access to one, though, you can build a humidity chamber by stretching clear plastic sheeting across a box frame made of bamboo.\n\n\nMake sure that any humidity chamber you use stays moist. Keep it in full sun, and place it where the air is moist.\nIf you need to generate additional humidity, you can do so by running a humidifier or by placing dishes of water-covered gravel around the base of the cutting.",
                "Transplant once roots form. Your cuttings should form new roots within a week or two. They are ready to be treated as established seedlings at this point and may be transplanted into a permanent garden space.",
                "Choose the right location. Ideally, you should find a spot that receives full sun and one that does not have any competitive roots, like tree roots, nearby.[3]\n\n\"Full sun\" means a full six hours of sunlight daily, if not more.\nThe area should also be free of weeds. If there are a few weeds, make sure that you remove them before planting.\nThe vines need space to climb and spread, as well. Ideally, you should look for climbing structures already set in place, like a wire fence, balcony, or pergola. If none of these are available, you could install a trellis, instead.",
                "Amend the soil. Passion fruit needs light, deep soil that contains plenty of organic material. The stuff in your yard probably is not of high enough quality to do the trick on its own, so you'll need to made a few improvements before you can plant either seeds or vines.\n\n\nMix the soil with compost before you do any planting. Compost improves both the texture and nutritional value of the soil. You could also try organic rotten manure, leaf mold, or other green plant waste.\nIf the soil is especially dense, you could lighten it by mixing in a handful of coarse sand.\nPay attention to the pH of the soil, as well. The pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5. If the soil is too acidic, mix in ground dolomite or agricultural lime.",
                "Transplant each seedling into a large hole. Dig a separate hole for each seedling. Each hole should be twice as wide as the current width of your plant, and the depth should be at least as deep as the container your seedling currently rests in.\n\n\nCarefully dig or slide the passion fruit seedling and its root system out of the container.\nPlace the root system in the center of the hole, then loosely fill in the rest of the hole with soil until the plant feels secure.\nHandle the roots as little as possible during the transfer. The roots are very sensitive, and if you damage them during the process, you could destroy the plant.",
                "Mulch and fertilize around the plant. Spread pellet chicken manure or another organic, slow-release fertilizer around the base of the plant. Also spread an organic mulch, like straw or wood chips, around the base of the plant.\n\n\nThe entire root system needs access to the fertilizer and mulch. For best results, gently push or dig some of the cover into the top layer of the soil after spreading the fertilizer and mulch around the plant's base.",
                "Water well. Use a watering can or garden hose to gently water the seedlings after they have been planted. Make sure that the water is very moist, but do not allow muddy puddles to form, since this could be an indication that you have provided more water than the soil can absorb and drain.",
                "Feed regularly. Passion fruit plants are heavy eaters, so you will need to provide plenty of water and fertilizer throughout the growing season.\n\n\nYou should apply fertilizer in the spring and once every four weeks throughout the summer season. A final feeding should also be done in the mid-autumn. Use organic, slow-release fertilizers that are low in nitrogen. Chicken manure pellets are a good option.\nIf the area you live in gets plenty of rainfall, you might not need to water the plant too often. If you are going through a drought, though, or if you only live in moderately moist conditions, you will need to water the vine at least once a week. Never allow the surface of the soil to completely dry out.",
                "Train the vines. As the vines spread out, you may need to train them to climb up along your fence, trellis, or other support structure. The plant will be healthiest if the vines are encouraged to climb, and a healthy plant will produce the greatest yield.\n\n\nTraining the vines is a fairly simple process once you get the hang of it. When fresh vines or feelers begin to stretch out, tie the vine around its base and around the wire of your structure using thin rope or string. Keep the knot loose to avoid choking the vine.\nWhen the plant is new, lateral branches that come from the main stem should be nipped off to the level of the wire. The two side branches coming from the main stem should then be bent around the top wire of your structure and forces to grow in opposite directions.\nOnce the side branches are spread apart, lateral branches can develop from them and hang down loosely.",
                "Weed around the plants. Since passion fruit plants require so much food and water, the enriched soil often becomes a target for unwanted weeds. You need to remove as many of these nearby weeds as possible so that resources are not being directed away from the passion fruit plant.\n\n\nKeep 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) of space around each side of the vine base weed-free. Use organic methods of weed removal and do not use chemicals. Mulch can help prevent weeds from shooting up out of the ground, and hand-pulling weeds that do sprout is another good option.\nThe rest of the garden can have other plants and weeds in it, but you should keep away plants that could spread disease or attract pests. Legume plants, in particular, are dangerous to keep around passion fruit plants.",
                "Prune as needed. The main reasons for pruning the plant are simply to keep the vines in check and to provide adequate sunlight to the lower portions of the plant.\n\n\nPrune in the spring every second year. Make sure that you do so before the plant flowers. Pruning after flowering has occurred can weaken the plant and limit its yield.\nUse shears to cut away branches that are below 2 feet (60 cm). Doing so clears away weak, old growth while also improving air circulation around the bottom of the plant.[4]\n\nWhen pruning, make sure that you are not removing a major branch by following the stem along to its base before you cut it away.\nLeave three to five nodes near the base of a branch when you cut it off. New growth can emerge from the stump this leaves behind.",
                "Assist in the pollination process, if necessary. Usually, bees will take care of the pollination process without any additional help from you. If there are no bees in your area, though, you might need to do some work yourself.\n\n\nTo hand-pollinate the plants, take a small, clean paintbrush and collect the pollen from male flowers. Wipe the collected pollen onto female flowers using the same brush.\nYou could also touch the anthers and stigmatic surfaces of each flower with your thumb and index finger as you walk along the rows.",
                "Protect the passion fruit from pests. You should not use insecticides until you identify the early stages of a pest problem. When you do use pesticides, use organic options since chemical options can ruin the fruit produced and make it unsafe for consumption.\n\n\nThe biggest pest-related problems are aphids, vine girders, and coleopteran beetle larva.\n\nAphids can usually be discouraged by sprinkling red pepper around the base of the plant.\nGet rid of vine girders by mixing an organic insecticide in a tar base. Spread this solution around the base of the main stem, and get rid of damaged vines.\nTo get rid of beetle larva, you will need to use a systemic insecticide before the plant goes to flower.",
                "Protect the plant from disease. There are a handful of diseases you should try to prevent. When you spot signs of plant disease, you also need to do what you can to get rid of it and prevent the disease from spreading.\n\n\nPassion fruit vines can fall victim to rot and viral diseases.\n\nCellar rot and root rot must be prevented ahead of time by providing adequate soil drainage.\nYou can attempt to treat virus-infected plants with a commercial solution, but usually, you will need to cut off and burn the affected vines in order to preserve any of the remaining plants. Passion fruit mottle virus, passion fruit ringspot virus, and cucumber mosaic virus are your most common threats.",
                "Harvest the fruit. It can take a year to a year and a half before your plant will produce any fruit, but once it does, you can harvest this fruit and eat it.[5]\n\nTypically, ripe passion fruit will drop from the vine as soon as they are ready for consumption. The drop itself does not hurt the fruit, but you should collect the fruit within a couple of days after it drops to ensure the best possible quality.\nIf you have a variety that does not drop its fruit, simply pluck off each fruit once you notice the skin beginning to wrinkle."

This should include both checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and any personal property you own (like cars or boats).",
                "Refresh your memory of loan terminology. There are some basic loan terms that are simple to understand but may be confusing at first to borrowers who are unfamiliar with them. Learn a few of the basic terms so that you understand what your lender is talking about and know what to look for. Your lender should also be able to explain these terms and any other, more complex terms that may show up. For now, start with the following terms:\n\n\nAnnual percentage rate (APR). This is the annual interest rate charged on the loan.\nLender fees. These are additional fees (on top of interest) that are paid to the lender at closing.\nLoan program. This is the general type of mortgage that describes the interest rates and length of the loan's life. Some common loan programs include 15-year fixed mortgage rate or 30-year adjustment rate mortgage (ARM).\n\"Good Faith\" estimate. This is the initial, pre-approval set of loan terms given to you by a lender. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees that will be charged.[2]",
                "Decide what you're looking for in a mortgage. It will be difficult to find the right lender if you don't know what kind of mortgage you are looking for. For example, think about how quickly you want to pay off your mortgage. The lives of these loans can vary widely in length, so make sure you know what your plan is. Just make sure to consider that paying off the loan in a shorter time will result in higher monthly payments (but less overall interest paid).[3]",
                "Make a list of questions to ask. Think about specifically what you want to know when applying for a mortgage loan. For example, consider asking what monthly payments would be under a variety of different loan terms. Or, you could ask why certain fees are charged. You can ask any number of things of your lender without even applying for loan, so ask as many questions as you need to. If your lender doesn't take the time to respond to them or is difficult to reach, you may want to seek other lenders.[4]\n\nKeep the questions consistent between lenders so you have a standard of comparison.\nAsk about special mortgage loans if you think you qualify for them.[5] Special loan programs include VA loans (for veterans of the armed forces), USDA loans (for rural areas), and programs offered by state or local governments. These programs may offer borrowers lower rate or better repayment terms.[6]",
                "Ask around for recommendations to reputable mortgage brokers who can give more options by being independent from the lenders and banks. The first lender you find may not have the best loan package. You should take advantage of any connections you have that can refer you to a reputable mortgage lender.\n\n\nCall your current mortgage lender or bank, if you've had a good experience with them in the past. Being a return customer may give you some leverage with negotiations.\nSearch the Internet financial sections for mortgage interest rates.\nTalk to friends for recommendations.\nTake recommendations from real estate professionals for mortgage lenders they've had a good working relationship with.[7]",
                "Ask each prospective mortgage lender what their interest rates are for the type of mortgage you are considering. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand the type of loans they're proposing.\n\n\nFor example, you should always ask for the specific interest rate charged on each loan duration. This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR).\nAdditionally, you should ask whether the stated interest rate on each loan is fixed (non-changing) or adjustable (changing).[8]",
                "Gather the interest rates applicable to various loan terms at each mortgage lender. Get interest rates for various different types of loans and loan durations from each lender so that you can compare these different loan types between them. This also will be helpful if you change your mind about the loan duration you want.\n\n\nFor example, imagine you are considering either a 15 year or a 30 year loan. You ask for rate estimates from two lenders. The first offers you a 15 year loan at 3.1 percent and a 30 year estimate of 3.8 percent. The second offers rates of 3.2 and 3.7 percent, respectively. You would then see that the first lender offered a better rate for the 15 year loan but was not as good of a choice for the 30 year loan.[9]",
                "Request a written explanation of the estimated charges, costs and/or fees that the lender would require of you at closing time. This statement is a \"Good Faith Estimate.\" Most reputable mortgage lenders will offer to provide this for you.\n\n\nMake sure the Good Faith Estimate includes costs for all points, processing, legal fees, filing and closing fees.\nYou can also have the lender email or fax this estimate to you as a backup.[10]",
                "Confirm that the lenders in question are licensed. Access the National Mortgage Licensing System & Registry (NMLS) to determine whether or not each of your mortgage lenders are licensed in your state. Immediately eliminate from the list those lenders that do not show up on this website. The NMLS can be accessed at http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org.[11]",
                "Think about how helpful each lender seemed. How a lender acted when you met with them can say a lot about how doing business with them will be later. Look for lenders who were helpful, professional, and willing to answer any questions you had. Did the lender stick to the interest rate they quoted over the phone or online? Do they set forth a timeline for progressing with your loan application (when to lock in rates, etc.)? Eliminate any lenders that seemed shady in any way.[12]\n\nAlso, pass on the mortgage lenders that did not provide clear written information.",
                "Look for lender reviews. Search for each lender online to locate reviews of that lender. There should be sources like Zillow.com and Google local reviews that show up when you search for the lender. Look for higher scores and watch out for any problems other borrowers have run into with that lender.[13]",
                "Try negotiating the fees on the Good Faith Estimate. Lenders may be able to waive or lower some of the fees, even those that they originally try to argue are \"necessary.\" For example, you should try to negotiate down the application fee to free or near free, if possible. Additionally, the appraisal fee is a necessary fee, but only if it is within reasonable bounds; you should negotiate down an appraisal fee that is over $400. If you are using a broker to get your loan, you may also be able to negotiate down origination fees and underwriting fees.\n\n\nSome fees are always non-negotiable. These include recording fees, title insurance, tax-related fees, document stamp fees, and title fees.[14]\n\nYou may also be able to negotiate discount points down. However, these are essentially a form of prepaid interest on the house, so you gain nothing in the long run by avoiding this expense now.\nFor example, you might be able to pay $2,000 to reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percent. This would save you money by reducing your monthly payment by a small amount each month, and would add up over the life of your loan.[15]",
                "Compare all written documentation from each mortgage lender. The lowest rate is not necessarily the best option if there are thousands of dollars more in fees and expenses than a slightly higher interest rate loan.\n\n\nFor example, you will be charged an origination fee on your loan. This is a percentage of the total value of the loan and is usually around one percent. If you were offered two loans with the same interest rate of 4.5 percent, but the first charges a 1.5 percent origination fee compared to the second's one percent origination fee, you would be better off choosing the second loan.[16]",
                "Narrow your possible choices of mortgage lenders. Compare your lenders' offered interest rates and fees structures for the type of loan you are seeking. Obviously, you should go with the reputable lender that offers you the cheapest combination of interest rates and fees.\n\n\nUnderstand each loan type the mortgage lender is offering. There's a great deal of difference in a 30-year fixed-rate and a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), mainly that the interest rate in the ARM stands to change unexpectedly. Know the difference and feel confident in the explanation provided by the mortgage lender.[17]",
                "Contact the mortgage lender you've selected. Ask them to lock in the interest rate and fees you've negotiated and draw up a contract. Make sure to ask if your good faith estimate rates and fee structure still stand.[18]",
                "Read the fine print of the mortgage contract before signing. Make sure you look at the fine print to ensure that you are getting the loan terms and fees that you have negotiated. Pay special attention to what happens if the loan doesn't go through. It is a serious red flag if the \"good faith\" or \"earnest money\" deposit you give the lender in advance is kept by the lender in the event that the loan doesn't go through.\n\n\nAgain, ask for an explanation if there are any unexpected fees or confusingly worded statements in the contract.[19]"

        "How to Store a Quilt": {
            "intro": "Storing quilts can sound like a simple thing, but the quilt will only remain in good condition if it is stored clean and correctly. The effort is rewarded by keeping your quilt in first rate condition, free of insect or temperature damage and maintaining its heirloom value.",
            "steps": [
                "Ensure your quilt is clean before storing. Any food scraps or stains need to be removed prior to storage as these tend to attract insects as their own food source. Also remove dirt, smudges and any other source of stains. The safest method for cleaning a quilt is vacuuming, followed by airing, then washing. Each approach is discussed in the following steps.",
                "Vacuum the quilt. The best vacuum is a hand-held one, such as a dust buster. Alternatively, use the upholstery nozzle of a standard household vacuum cleaner, covered with muslin/cheesecloth or similar light fabric. Set the vacuum to the lowest level and sweep it back and forth across the quilt to collect loose fluff, debris and dirt. Check that the quilt looks okay before deciding whether anything further is needed before storage.\n\n\nIf the quilt is antique, place a nylon or fiberglass screen across the quilt before vacuuming; this will protect the fibers from the strong suction.",
                "Air the quilt. If the only noticeable problem with the quilt is that it smells musty or unpleasant, airing might be the answer. To air the quilt:\n\n\nWait for a dry day without too much wind.\nFind a suitable shady spot outside. The spot should be fairly clean, such as concrete, nice grass or fresh new leaves, etc. Don't choose a spot where there is a lot of dust liable to blow over the quilt.\nThrow a large cotton sheet across the ground. This will keep the quilt separate from the surface, preventing any potential stains.\nLay the quilt over the sheet, taking care not to overlap at the edges.\nAlternatively, a quilt that is in good, strong condition can be laid over a clothesline. If so, throw the base sheet over several of the lines of the clothesline (as if you were laying the table), then drape the quilt across the sheet, over the several lines. This method will probably use up all of the clothesline, so avoid doing it on a usual washing day. Avoid pinning the quilt to the clothesline as usually done for drying clothing, as this will stretch the stitches and fibers too much.",
                "Wash the quilt. This requires full knowledge on your behalf of what can happen to the quilt, and given that quilts are made from varying materials, this can be hard to know sometimes. Issues that you might encounter include dyes running, fabric shrinkage, stretched stitches and fibers due to the heaviness of being wet and pummeling by the washing process itself. To know whether or not it's okay to wash the quilt, answer the following questions:\n\n\nDo you know the age of the quilt? A more recent quilt may be less impacted by a wash than an older one.\nWhat condition is the quilt in? If it's already falling apart, washing is not really an option. However, it is possible to baste fraying edges with tulle, organza or netting before washing, provided you're up for the extra effort.\nHave you tested the fabric dyes in the quilt? This is easier done if you made the quilt as you'll likely have swatches of the fabric pieces used. If it's an heirloom quilt, and the person who made it is still alive, ask this person whether the fabrics are dye-fast. If neither is possible, test by dampening a back or non-obvious section of each fabric pieces and blot with a white face washer or other cloth. If the dye comes off on the blotter, you'll know it's going to run during a wash. Even if it doesn't come off on the blotter, try this test again with a little detergent this time; if the dye shows, the fabric will run when detergent is added. If both tests show no dye, it's safe to wash.\nHas the quilt been washed before? If so, you'll already know how it stood up to a wash.\nIs the quilt strong or fragile? Only strong quilts should be washed.",
                "Wash the quilt in the bath. If you've answered the above questions to your satisfaction, consider washing by hand. Machine washing is really only suitable for very strong quilts (or those cheap ones made in China that you intend to only hang on to for a short time). The bathtub is the best place as it's big and there's plenty of room to maneuver. Ideally, you will need a helper to wash and lift the wet quilt.\n\n\nFill the bath about 8 inches/20cm with lukewarm/tepid water. (If your local water is hard, consider using distilled water or rainwater from the tank, heated in a kettle or saucepan.)\nLower a large sheet into the bath first. This acts as a \"sling\" for the quilt.\nGently lower the quilt onto the sheet.\nPress gently across the quilt. Swish the water around gently, but not the quilt; keep it steady.\nIf using a detergent, make sure it is suitable for the quilt. Ask at a local quilt retailer or society for advice on a suitable detergent. A wool wash will usually be okay if you can't find a specialized detergent but dilute it before adding it to the bathwater.\nDrain the water, taking care to keep the quilt away from the drain suction. Refill with lukewarm water for a rinse cycle. Gently agitate, drain again. Do this about 4 to 6 times until you feel the quilt has been cleaned adequately and the detergent is off the quilt.\nDrain one last time. Pat the quilt with large dry and clean towels. These will start to absorb leftover water from the quilt.\nLift the quilt out of the bath by holding the corners of the sheet it is sitting on. Carry it outside to dry (see Airing above, although you may wish to substitute a blanket for a sheet on the ground). This really needs to be done with a helper, to prevent a mishap (and wet quilts tend to be heavy). When drying, place right side down to keep this as clean as possible.\nAllow to dry completely. It should not be stored until it is completely dry, to avoid the possibility of mildew growth.",
                "Wash by machine. This is riskier than washing by hand but may be suitable for a strong, modern quilt that you know won't run when washed. It's also a fairly painful process because you can't just shove the quilt in and walk away. Here is what to do:\n\n\nCheck that the quilt will fit. Many times they won't and it's no good pushing it in so tightly that it'll break the washing machine.\nUse the delicate washing cycle only. Use wool wash for the detergent, or a suitable quilt detergent.\nCheck the progress of the washing every half a minute.\nStop the washing after 3 minutes.\nUse a short rinse cycle. If you have a gentle spin dry, use this.\nRemove the quilt from the washing machine. Dry as for Airing above.",
                "Be very careful when cleaning antique quilts. These aren't just old, they're usually very delicate and they've suffered their fair share of wear and tear. The fibers and colors of such quilts are likely to have been exposed to light, moisture and acidic conditions over time and hence will have weakened.\n\n\nIf the quilt seems too fragile to wash, call a local museum or textile conservator society to ask for their opinion. There will usually be someone in such a community organization who is willing to offer advice on the best cleaning options.\nDo not give an antique quilt to a dry cleaner unless a select service is recommended by a quilt society or textile conservator.",
                "Determine the age of your quilt. Older quilts lack the strength and resilience of quilts made from more modern materials. As such, the age of the quilt will determine some of the storage method, requiring greater care about folding and using non-acidic materials for storing.",
                "Wash your hands. Your body oils will transfer to the fabric as you prepare the quilt for storage. Either wash your hands and dry thoroughly or don a pair of cotton gloves.",
                "Fold the quilt. This will enable you to place it inside a protective cover and then place on a shelf or other storage space. However, it is a good idea to use acid-free paper between each layer of the quilt to protect it from staining and creasing, and wherever the folds are, stuff these with crumpled acid-free paper to prevent the holds from becoming too permanent.\n\n\nIf you can, store the quilt flat rather than folding it; this is the most ideal way of storing, although it is recognized that few people have such space to spare.\nIf the quilt is small and thin, roll it around a tube; this will prevent creases and folds from forming.",
                "Place the folded quilt inside a suitable protective cover. The cover will protect it from insects, dust and other sources of potential damage. Cover with a cotton pillowcase or similar cotton sack. A large cotton sheet or length of muslin can improvise as a cover.\n\n\nPlastic is not an ideal covering; it can sweat (creating humidity) and some plastic bags may even leach colors from dyes and damage the quilt, especially with long-term storage.\nAnything that the quilt is stored in or on must be acid-free.",
                "Bear in mind what not to do when storing a quilt. Things that should be avoided during quilt storage include:\n\n\nDirect sunlight\nDirect or close heat (even from an incandescent bulb; if possible, replace with fluorescent lighting inside the storage area)\nHigh temperature or high humidity\nAcidic surfaces (this includes some wooden surfaces).",
                "Put the quilt into a closet, or anywhere that is dark. If quilts are stored in semi- or full-light, they will fade overtime.\n\n\nIt is not a good idea to put quilts in storage anywhere that moisture is likely to occur, such as the basement or the attic. Moisture will cause mildew growth in fabric. And if the quilt is overheated, it will begin to fall apart, while very cold temperatures will cause it to turn brittle.\nThe temperature range for storing a quilt is ideal around 59 - 68ºF/15 - 20ºC, with humidity around 50 percent.",
                "Deter insects by adding some sort of repellent. Many herbs are suitable for this purpose, as are cedar balls or blocks.\n\n\nDo not allow insect repellents to come into direct contact with the stored quilt (or any other fabrics in the storage space).",
                "Remove the quilt from storage periodically. Don't expect to be able to store a quilt for years without ever opening it. A quilt needs to be aired regularly and folded out to prevent permanent fold lines and musty odors. At least every 6 months, be prepared to remove the quilt, air it (see above) and let it remain unfolded for a few days before returning it to storage.\n\n\nIf you have a guest bedroom, this is an ideal space to leave the quilt spread out for a week to \"unfold\" before returning to storage."

If you feed your cat canned food, feed him three times a day or as needed to keep him satisfied.[3]\n\nIf feeding your cat wet, canned food, try for an average of eight to 12 ounces of food per day.[4]\n\nYou do not want your cat to be overweight, but your Sphynx cat should never be bony. If his weight decreases, or his ribs become more obvious, then increase the ration by five to 10%. Reweigh him again a week later to check the weight loss has been arrested.\nAlternatively, look for a food that is marketed for active cats, or look for a breed-specific food made for Sphynx cats. These tend to be higher calorie than the equivalent amount of regular food.\nFeed your Sphynx cat a good quality, protein rich food. Meat should be listed first and second on the pet food label. Avoid foods where a large percentage is cereal based.",
                "Set up a litter box. You should provide your cat with a large litter box. It should be placed in a quiet, out of the way spot. Check with the breeder to see which cat litter he used to provide consistency for your cat.[5]",
                "Provide scratch posts. These provide an outlet for the cat's natural desire to scratch. Place several posts in your home, near entrance and exits, and next to the cat's bed.[6]",
                "Keep your Sphynx cat warm. Because of the small amount of hair, the Sphynx cat needs to be kept warm. Usually, keeping the cat in your home at room temperature is enough. Sphynx cats also often lie in sunlight shining through windows or sit near objects that give off heat. Your Sphynx may want to cuddle with you often to be near your body heat. He may also want to sleep beneath your comforter at night.[7]\n\nProvide access to blankets that your cat can lay on or under.\nDuring the winter you may need to place your Sphynx cat in sweaters.[8]",
                "Protect your cat from sun exposure. Because the Sphynx cat’s skin is exposed, you need to protect it from the sun. A limited amount of sun is fine, but too much can give your cat sunburn.[9]\n\nUse UV blocking shirts or hats on your cat.[10]\n\nYou may want to install sun-blocking screens on your windows to make sure your cat doesn’t lie in a sunny spot and get sunburnt.[11]",
                "Bathe your cat regularly. Sphynx cats need regular bathing to keep their skin in good condition. Because of the lack of hair, the Sphynx’s body secretes oil. This causes the breed to need frequent bathing.[12] You should bathe your cat once a week.\n\n\nSphynx cats are a great breed for people who are allergic to cats and cat hair. By bathing, your cat often, it also washes away dander and helps to keep the allergic component down.[13]\n\nSphynx cats have different degrees of hairlessness. Some Sphynx cats are completely hairless with skin that feels like a warm chamois leather. Some Sphynx cats have downy hair over their body, which feels like warm peach fuzz.\nThe skin itself is often \"oversized\" for the body and sits in wrinkles. These wrinkles can be pronounced over the forehead and give the cat a quizzical or worried expression.[14]",
                "Wash your cat’s ears. Because of the large size of the Sphynx’s ears, they need to be cleaned regularly. Gently clean the ears with cleaning solution on a cotton ball or cotton swab once a week. If you neglect your Sphynx’s ears, he can get a build up of ear wax, oil, and dirt.",
                "Clean your cat’s eyes. Sphynx cats don’t have eyelashes. This means that the eyes can get dirt and other build up around them, which can cause irritation. To clean your cat’s eyes, gently wipe them with a damp tissue.\n\n\nDon’t use anything containing alcohol or other irritants, like baby wipes, around your cat’s eyes. It will cause more irritation.",
                "Give your Sphynx a lot of attention. Sphynx cats love people and being around people. If you want a cat to bond with who wants to take part in what you're doing, then a Sphynx is a good choice. Sphynx cats are known to follow their owners around the house with wagging tails.[15]\n\nPlay with your Sphynx cat twice a day.",
                "Satisfy the Sphynx’s natural curiosity. The Sphynx is renowned for his inquisitive nature. He puts a lot of enthusiasm into whatever he does, which along with his natural curiosity means the Sphynx can get up to mischief if he’s not provided with an outlet for his normal behavior. Because of this energy and curiosity, the breed has a lot of character and can be seen as quite mischievous.",
                "House your Sphynx cat inside. Because of your Sphynx cat’s lack of hair, you need to keep her inside. If she is left outside, she can get sunburned or too cold. If you let your Sphynx cat outside, make sure to watch her closely to make sure the elements don’t make her sick.",
                "Consider companions for your Sphynx cat. The Sphynx cat is a social cat who doesn’t like being alone. If you are gone from home often, consider having another Sphynx cat or other pets. Sphynx cats do very well with other pets, including dogs and other cats.[16][17]",
                "Provide places for the cat to climb. Sphynx cats have a lot of energy. They like to climb on furniture and doors, and even climb on people’s shoulders. They also are good at balancing and can be acrobatic tricks.[18] Make your home a fun place for your Sphynx cat to explore by giving him plenty of places to climb.\n\n\nConsider attaching shelving to the wall in such a way that the cat has an aerial walkway around a room. Providing a high perch beside a door will give the Sphynx a great spot from which to watch people come and go, which could prevent your Sphynx trying to dash out the door each time.",
                "Vaccinate your cat. You should vaccinate your Sphynx cat against common infectious diseases, such as cat flu, feline infectious enteritis, feline leukemia, and rabies. The initial kitten vaccinations require two doses to be effective, given from nine weeks of age and given three to four weeks apart.[19]\n\nIf in doubt about when to vaccinate, phone your local veterinary clinic to be advised of the protocol that they recommend and work to.\nGet your cat booster injections once a year.",
                "Desex your cat. Your Sphynx cat should be spayed or neutered. This generally takes place around five to six months old, before your female cat can start getting pregnant.\n\n\nWhile you are getting your cat fixed, you can also have an identichip fitted. ID chips are a permanent way of identifying your cat.",
                "Control parasites and worms. Other preventative health care for your cat includes parasite control and deworming. You want to discuss a flea prevention medicine with your vet. You should also get your cat dewormed every three months.[20]"

        "wikiHow to Start a Hedge Fund": {
            "intro": "Becoming the manager of your own hedge fund will give you the opportunity to invest other people's money for them, which can be profitable for you and your investors. If you're an experienced financial advisor, it may be advantageous for you to step out from under the umbrella of the investment banking industry and strike your own path. To start a hedge fund, you'll need to create and register a fund and start an investment company to be the fund's general partner. In this endeavor, the investors will act as limited partners in a private partnership.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn the basics of a hedge fund. Hedge funds are pools of investor money that use a large range of different strategies to both generate returns for investors and manage risk. Hedge funds are typically only available to sophisticated investors with large amounts of assets to invest (often over $1 million).[1]\n\nThe term hedge fund comes from the practice of \"hedging\", which is the practice of reducing risk in an asset by taking a position in a related security to offset any downward price movements. These related securities often take the form of derivatives like futures, options, and forward contracts. Essentially, this strategy is intended to protect capital in the event of a negative event that causes an asset to lose value.[2]\n\nHedge funds often use a wide range of complex strategies to maximize returns like using leverage (or borrowed money), using derivatives to profit from global economic trends, trading currencies, and investing in stock and bonds in markets all around the globe.",
                "Distinguish between hedge funds and mutual funds. Mutual funds and hedge funds are similar in that they are both pools of money managed by a fund manager. Other than this, however, there are several key differences. These differences are important to consider when starting one.[3]\n\nFirstly, hedge funds are not as regulated as mutual funds, and so they can invest in a more diverse and risky range of securities, as well as use strategies that mutual funds cannot use. Hedge funds can use large amounts of leverage (or borrowed money), short sell, and perform riskier trades on behalf of their investors, whereas mutual funds cannot.\n\nNote that the strategies available to the hedge fund manager must be identified in the private placement memorandum that must be available to the investor before purchase.\n\n\nSecondly, hedge funds and mutual funds have different levels of availability. Mutual funds are publicly-registered securities with SEC-approved prospectuses and are available to all investors. Hedge funds are funded through private placements to accredited investors, who must have a net worth of over $1 million (not including the value of your home) or an annual income of over $200,000 (now and going forward).\nThirdly, hedge fund investors are typically \"locked-in\" for a period. Whereas a mutual fund investor can sell their shares whenever they want, a hedge fund shareholder may be restricted for a certain period of time.\nFinally, hedge fund managers are compensated differently from mutual fund managers. Mutual fund managers receive a set percentage of total assets managed each year, whereas hedge fund managers typically receive a set percentage of total assets (usually about 2%), plus a percentage of profits that are earned. This percentage is usually about 20%.\n\nManager compensation is defined in the hedge fund's prospectus and is agreed to by the investor.",
                "Select a hedge fund strategy. Hedge funds managers usually get their start by achieving a successful investing track record throughout years of industry experience. This is how they attract their first clients and build out their funds. But even with the requisite experience, you'll also need an overall vision for your fund, including an idea of how it will generate returns for investors. Hedge funds can follow a number of different strategies, including:[4]\n\nMarket Neutral Strategy: This is a popular strategy that involves purchasing a group of investments that are expected to go up, and then offsetting these investments dollar-for-dollar by short-selling the overall market (one of the S&P 500 Index ETFs, for example). If the portion that is expected to go up does better than the short-sold portion, the fund would make money. This can be a useful strategy to market to investors who are concerned about market crashes.\nHedged equity strategy: This strategy is similar to the market neutral strategy, except instead of shorting the entire portion of the portfolio that you expect to rise on a dollar-for-dollar basis, only a portion would be shorted. For example, if you had a $1 million portfolio, $300,000 may be shorted. This means if the market were to collapse there would be some protection, but generally speaking your fund would be structured to make money from markets rising.\nGlobal Macro strategy: This type of strategy seeks to make money from large economic trends. If you have extensive knowledge of economics, global economic trends, global economies, and how these pieces fit together, this may be a good strategy to pursue. Global Macro strategies make money by forming an idea of what will happen to a particular country's (or multiple countries), stock index, interest rate, currency, or inflation/deflation levels.\nHedge fund managers typically pursue a strategy to reduce the volatility of a portfolio while maximizing the upside profit potential. In times of expected market declines, this may mean buying low velocity stocks while shorting high velocity security. In this way, the decline in the former would be offset by greater gains in the latter.",
                "Hire a law firm. When starting a hedge fund, it is absolutely certain that you will need a lawyer throughout the process at some point. It is always advisable to establish contact with a group of lawyers experienced in financial law who will be be able to help you not only with the initial incorporation, but also with other aspects of establishing the fund. This is not the time for a silly paperwork slip-up that could cost you. Consult the experts.\n\n\nLook around for lawyers that are experienced in financial law, and even better, lawyers that have experience specifically working with and starting hedge funds.",
                "Decide what kind of entity you want to create. The fund entity type that you are able or required to create will depend on your state's regulatory laws. Limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and trusts are the typical entities used to create a hedge fund, but you'll need to research local laws regarding the formation of business entities to learn more. Contact the commerce department in your state.\n\n\nA limited partnership has two parts. It will have a general partner, who will serve as the manager and is personally liable for all the business's debts and obligations. Corporations can serve as general partners. It will then have limited partners, who are not liable for the debts of the company.\nFor the most part, hedge funds are typically formed as limited partnerships, in which an incorporated group of investors acts as the limited partners, and an investment advisor acts as the general partner [5]",
                "Assemble an investment team of trusted advisors. If you're spinning off from an investment bank, it's typical to try bringing some coworkers with you to your new venture. A good team is essential to success.[6]\n\nIt's hard to sell yourself to investors without first establishing a successful track record. Choosing workers with great employment histories and successful track records buying and selling securities will help in the long run, seeding your company with human capital and enabling you to hit the ground running.\nWhen establishing a team, your goal should be to first finding people who you have a strong personal chemistry with, and who share your vision. Your next criteria should be experience. For example, if you are starting a market neutral fund, choose analysts who have experience doing the kind of high-level analytical work that is associated with creating a fund like that.",
                "Name your fund. Your fund needs to have a name attached to it before you can fill out the proper paperwork. It should be something that sounds memorable, stable and reputable. Use the name to promote your image.\n\n\nTry to connect the name of your fund to its overall strategy in some way. For example, if you are operating a market neutral fund that attempts to eliminate exposure to the overall market and generate steady, reasonable returns, your name should reflect this vision.",
                "Apply for a tax ID number. In the U.S. your fund entity will need to get a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This can be done by calling the IRS or going to its website and filling out the necessary forms.\n\n\nIt's free to get your ID number. The process takes only a few minutes and can be completed online.",
                "Register as an investment advisor. You will need to register with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment advisor if you have 15 or more investors associated with your fund. If you have less than 15, you generally do not have register with the SEC, but it is advisable to do so anyways since it adds to your overall credibility.\n\n\nIn addition, most states require an prospective investment adviser to pass the Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination (Series 65). Some states will waive exams for holders in good standing of professional designations such as the CFP, CFA, or CIC.\nTo register you'll also need to take the Series 65 regulatory exam. This three-hour test covers your basic knowledge of securities laws and practices as well as your understanding of ethics. When you pass the exam you will be a licensed investment advisor in your state.\nFill out a form U-10 with your state to register for the examination, then pay the small exam fee and schedule your test. It typically costs around $30.",
                "Create a corporate partner. An investment advisor has two basic choices in structuring a fund: you can either run your hedge fund as a sole proprietor, or you can create a corporation to partner with you and limit your own liability. It's a common practice to seek protection from liability by creating a corporation to act as the general partner of your fund entity. This partner will be your investment advisory company. [7]\n\nRemember that with a limited partnership, the general partner is completely responsible for all the firms debts and obligations. So, if you incorporate your general partner, your personal assets are protected in the case of a lawsuit or in the case of debts. This is because a corporation is a separate legal entity.\n\nFill out the articles of incorporation in your state.\nAlways consult your lawyer before incorporating, they can guide you effectively through the process.",
                "Write your corporate bylaws. Your firm will need to compile an in-house rulebook to move forward with incorporation and register with the SEC and the regulatory bodies in your state. The bylaws are yours to choose but might commonly include:\n\n\nA compliance manual\nAn ethical code of conduct\nA manual for supervisory procedures\nAn advisor's portfolio-management agreement",
                "Register your company as the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). Do this on the website of the Investment Advisor Registration Depository to make the partnership legal. The process is free but will take several hours to complete. You may want to speak to your legal team before moving forward with the process of registry.\n\n\nThis process is necessary to make your company able to manage assets and provide financial advice.",
                "Register yourself as the Investment Advisor Representative (IAR). After your fund is legally a Registered Investment Advisor, you must register yourself as the investment advisor for your fund.\n\n\nYou can register yourself as the investment advisor for the fund by going to the same website you went to when you registered your company as the Registered Investment Advisor. To complete the process, you'll need to submit a Form U-4 and pay the fee to the IARD.\nThe fee is about $30\nThis establishes you a representative of your company.",
                "Register the fund offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Hedge funds don’t technically register with the SEC but do register the \"offering\" of the limited partnership to investors. Just as corporations offer stock and LLC's offer memberships, limited partnerships offer \"interests\", and the offering of this interest must be registered with the SEC.\n\n\nOfferings exempt under Regulation D from registration must comply with specific limitation on the solicitation and sale of private securities. This includes restrictions on the type and number of investors solicited as well as the interests sold and requirements for adequate disclosure of the investment's details.\nTo register, fill out Form D with the SEC. You'll also need to fill out Form D in each state in which you intend to offer your fund.[8]",
                "Write offering documents. In order to attract investors to your hedge fund, you will need to create a set of documents that explain your fund's goals and terms of investment. This generally takes the form of a prospectus or private placement memorandum (also called an offering memorandum). This document both protects the hedge fund, by assigning liability for losses to the investors, and the investors, by providing specific strategies that will be employed by the hedge fund.[9]\n\nThese documents are not optional. They are required by securities regulators and must disclose specific information. Consult with professional legal counsel to ensure that you meet all of the necessary disclosure requirements.[10]",
                "Create an online presence. Despite regulations that prevent hedge funds from publicly advertising their funds, they are allowed to set up informational websites. These websites can display the experience and backgrounds of the fund's partners and provide information on the partners' investment strategies.[11] Having a clean, professional, and informative website can help foster trust in potential investors.",
                "Seek anchor capital to seed your fund. Getting the cash to get your fund off the ground can be the most difficult part of starting a hedge fund. You need assets under management, which you'll have to get from investors unless you're independently wealthy and want to seed the fund yourself. The best way to make your case to investors is to have an air-tight operation as well as an established track record of success during previous employment.\n\n\nYou will need to approach banks, venture capital firms, and wealthy investors with whom you or your team have prior relations with. It may be useful to establish strategic partnerships with these institutions where possible.\nIn addition, many hedge fund managers gather seed money from friends and business acquaintances.[12]",
                "Promote your hedge fund. Ultimately, seeking capital requires salesmanship, and you will need to convince investors that you can create value. To do this, when speaking to potential sources of capital, focus relentlessly on your strategy, how your strategy works, why your strategy works, and how it has an edge over the competition. Secondly, focus on your team, and your experience, strengths, and successes.\n\n\nInvestors are more likely to fund somebody with a proven track record of success, so be sure to play up your prior successes, as well as those of your partners or employees if you have them.\nConsider offering reductions in your management fee or partial fund ownership to early investors.[13]\n\nBe aware of the regulations affecting the marketing, solicitation, and sale of private interests on a Federal and state level.",
                "Attract investors through success. Initially, many hedge fund managers start with a small fund that is made up of a large amount of their own funds. Even with a prior record of success outside of hedge funds, investors are still skeptical of new funds until they have proven themselves. After an initial period of success, if you earn large returns on your investments, you will find it much easier to attract investors.[14]",
                "Find a \"prime-broker\". A prime broker is a bank that essentially provides you with all the financial services you need to run your fund. This includes lending you money, executing trades on your behalf, and providing you with what you need to do things like short sell stocks. They can also help you find investors for your fund.[15]\n\nApproach institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, or any other investment bank for these types of services.",
                "Hire brokers. If your hedge fund is performing well and you feel comfortable enough to expand operations, it's a good idea to start attracting talented brokers to expand your operation and start performing more transactions. You should to look for dedicated employees who want to make money in a fast-paced and competitive environment. Get the word out that you're looking for the best.\n\n\nGrowing doesn't necessarily mean taking on more employees. Some hedge funds are successfully in business as one-man operations.[16]",
                "Purchase more office space. As soon as you can afford it, move into a space appropriate for your business. Start small, but build a corporate office that will display the professionalism and spirit of your operation."

        "wikiHow to Do a Zigzag Stitch by Hand": {
            "intro": "The zigzag stitch is stretchy, durable, and nice to look at, making it very versatile in nature. Most sewing machines have a zigzag setting, but the zigzag stitch can also be worked easily enough by hand.",
            "steps": [
                "Poke through to the front of the fabric. Insert the needle through the fabric at the starting point of your stitch line, A. Poke through from the back of the fabric to the front.\n\n\nPull the needle and thread completely through so that the end knot lies flush against the back of the fabric.\nYour A point should be at the bottom right edge of your desired stitch line.",
                "Stitch a vertical line. Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a position directly above your A point. This new insertion point will be point B.\n\n\nPull the needle and thread completely through to the back of the fabric, creating a flat vertical stitch between A and B. This stitch must be straight, not slanted.\nThe distance between A and B will be the width of your stitch. Unless otherwise specified, a width of 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) should suffice.",
                "Return to the starting point. Insert the needle through the fabric at A again. Pull the needle and thread through from back to front.\n\n\nTighten the thread until it creates a flat vertical stitch at the back of the fabric, mirroring the one on the front.",
                "Move the stitch diagonally across. Cross the thread over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a point lying even with B and to the left. This will be your C point.\n\n\nThe horizontal distance between B and C should roughly match the stitch width. In this example, it should be 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).\nContinue pulling the needle and thread through to the back of the fabric until a flat diagonal stitch connecting A and C appears on the front of the fabric.",
                "Bring the needle back through to the front. Insert the needle through the fabric from back to front, bringing it through at a point vertically beneath C and to the horizontal left of A. This newest point is point D.\n\n\nPull the thread through completely, creating a flat vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from C to D.\nWith this step, you have completed a single zigzag stitch.",
                "Repeat the stitch down the length of the row. Repeat the steps used to create the first stitch down the entire length of your stitch row. End the row with a vertical stitch.\n\n\nReset your stitch labels at the end of each complete zigzag stitch. In other words, the C point of your first zigzag becomes the B point of your second, and the D point of your first zigzag becomes the A point of your second.\nFor each stitch:\n\nStitch a vertical line between A and B on the front of the fabric.\nStitch a vertical line between B and A along the back, inserting the needle through to the front at A again.\nStitch diagonally across the front of the fabric from A to C.\nStitch a vertical line along the back of the fabric from C to D, inserting the needle through to the front at D.\n\n\nEnd the row with a vertical stitch across the front of the fabric between the D and C of your final zigzag.\nMake sure that you maintain the same stitch width and length for each zigzag.",
                "Overlap the end point. Rename your stitch labels so that E is the bottom of your last vertical stitch and F is the top point of that same stitch. Cross over this final vertical stitch so that the needle comes out to the front of the fabric at E.\n\n\nIf done correctly, the stitch prior to this should have gone through to the back of the fabric at F.\nTo complete this step, make a vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from F to E, inserting the needle through E.",
                "Cross over the last diagonal stitch. Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at the top point of the adjacent vertical stitch, now identified as point G. Pull the thread through to create a flat diagonal stitch.\n\n\nThis newest diagonal stitch should cross over the center of the last diagonal stitch made during your first trip down the length of the row. The resulting stitch will be x-shaped.\nNote that G lies to the horizontal right of F.",
                "Double behind the vertical post. Insert the needle through to the front of the fabric at the bottom point of the current vertical post you're resting on. This point can now be referred to as point H.\n\n\nPoint H is directly beneath point G and to the right of E.",
                "Work your way back down the length of the row. Zigzag your stitches down the length of the row, working from the left edge to the right edge. End by overlapping the very first vertical post you made.\n\n\nThese stitches should be nearly identical to the ones you created down the first pass, but they will slant in the opposite direction (left to right instead of right to left).\nFor each stitch:\n\nStitch a vertical line between E and F on the front of the fabric, overlapping the vertical post already there.\nStitch between F and E along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at E again.\nStitch diagonally across the front from E to G.\nStitch between G and H along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at H.\n\n\nThe end of the row should conclude with a vertical stitch between your final H and G points.",
                "Knot the stitch in the back. If done correctly, the needle and thread should be at the back of your fabric. Knot the thread here and cut off any excess thread to complete the zigzag row.\n\n\nTo knot the thread:\n\nBring the needle through the front and back of the fabric at a spot directly next to your current insertion point.\nBefore drawing the thread flat, insert the needle through the loop you just created. Do so two or three times, then draw the loop closed. This should create a secure knot.",
                "Poke the needle through to the front of the fabric. Insert the needle through the fabric from back to front. Begin at the bottom left edge of your intended stitch line, point A.\n\n\nPull the needle and thread completely through until the end knot lies flat against the back of the fabric.",
                "Insert the needle into the fabric at the same point. Insert the needle through the front of the fabric at a point directly on top of A, point AA.\n\n\nAs you look at the front of the fabric, A and AA should look like the same point. There needs to be a few threads separating them to prevent the stitch from falling out, though.\nDo not pull the needle and thread through this point yet. Only insert the tip of the needle for now.",
                "Poke through at a diagonal point. Slide the tip of the needle along the back of the fabric at a 45 degree angle. Insert it through the front of the fabric at a point lying to the upward diagonal left of AA. This new point will be point B.\n\n\nThe space between AA and B will determine the width of your stitches. Unless otherwise noted, distance of 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) is usually a good choice.\nDo not pull the needle and thread completely through AA or B yet.",
                "Pull the thread into a loop. Use your fingers to position the thread leading into AA underneath the tip of the needle coming out at B.[3]\n\nA little line of thread should run parallel to the needle on its left side. The rest should be tucked beneath the needle, extending down from the needle's right side.",
                "Tighten the loop. Pull the needle and thread completely through to the front of the fabric again. Doing so should tighten the loop created in the previous step.\n\n\nThe needle should now be free and lying along the front of the fabric.\nNote that the point of the loop comes together at A and AA. The rounded portion of the loop should lie to the immediate outside of B, and the thread should be coming out at B to the inside of the loop.",
                "Pierce the center of the loop. Insert the needle through the fabric at a point that overlaps B. Label this point BB.\n\n\nAs with A and AA, B and BB should only have a few threads separating them.\nOnly insert the tip of the needle. Do not pull the entire needle through to the back of the fabric.",
                "Bring the needle out at a slant. Poke the tip of the needle back through to the front of the fabric at a 45 degree downward slant, bringing it out at point C.\n\n\nPoint C should be horizontally even with A and AA.\nDo not pull the needle completely through BB or C yet.",
                "Repeat the chain procedure. Create another chain link using the same procedure followed for the first chain. Your two chains should form one zigzag.\n\n\nSlide the thread underneath the tip of the needle coming out at BB, creating a wide loop in the process.\nPull the needle and thread completely through to the front of the fabric, tightening the loop you just created.",
                "Alternate the slant down the line. Continue making chains across the length of the row until you reach the end. Each chain should slant in the direction opposite the slant of the chain before and after it.\n\n\nEach chain stitch should be slanted at a 45 degree angle.",
                "Knot the thread at the back of the fabric. Once you reach the end of the stitch row, insert the needle into the front of the fabric and out through the back. Tie a knot at the back of the fabric.\n\n\nTo knot the thread:\n\nInsert the needle through the front and back of the fabric at a point directly next to your final insertion point.\nBefore you draw the thread flat, draw the needle through the newly created loop two or three times.\nDraw the loop closed to create a secure knot."

People who don’t feel empowered may have low self-esteem, feel unmotivated to go after goals and stop working toward happiness in their lives. You can empower yourself through emotional and physical activities that get you more in touch with how you affect your environment.",

Social interaction is a basic need and can improve self-esteem.\n\n\nIf meeting new people is difficult, start small. Look for a local community event in your local paper or have a Skype video chat with a close friend in another location.

                "Try a positive mantra. It can be a goal, a feeling you want to achieve or a sentence that makes you happy. Repeat it whenever you start thinking or speaking negatively.\n\n\nFor example, read and repeat quotes about empowerment.\nStephen King said, “You can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will.”\nMother Theresa said, “Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.”\nFind more quotes online.

Learning something new with a local college extension office, lifelong learning center or library is an inexpensive and powerful way to change your view of the world. Education is a powerful tool for confidence, because it gives you more opportunities.\n\n\nFor example, take this time to learn the computer, learn to do your own taxes, grow your own food, build a website, learn to ski, identify birds or become an amateur photographer.

                "Make a change in your life. Pick something small you have wanted to change and make it happen. Several small decisions can be as powerful as one large life decision.\n\n\nGood changes might include commuting by walking or biking, cutting back on alcohol or cigarettes, getting up earlier, going to bed earlier, reducing time on the internet or a device, scheduling time for yourself or trying a new recipe each week.",
                "Sign up for an athletic event. Choose something you have to train for, such as a half-marathon or a Tough Mudder. Exercise teaches mental resilience because you learn to push through pain and see its benefit.\n\n\nIn addition, being physically powerful may make you feel mentally powerful.",

        "How to Become a Child Model": {
            "intro": "Are you a kid with an outgoing personality who enjoys posing for photos? You might be the ideal candidate to become a child model. If you're interested in getting into the field, though, it's important to understand that it will take hard work, patience, commitment, and your parents' help to really be successful.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure you’re really interested in modeling. Being a model may seem like an exciting and glamorous job, but it actually requires a lot of hard work. It’s important to determine whether you will really enjoy the experience before you give up your free time that could be spent playing with friends to commit to modeling. Ask a friend or family to do a practice photo session with you to see if you have fun posing.[1]\n\nPractice photo sessions won’t just help you decide if you’ll enjoy modeling; they can help you feel more comfortable in front of the camera too.\nMake sure that your friend or family member gives you direction on how you should look in each photo because that’s what a professional photographer will do at a modeling photo shoot. For example, your friend might tell you to look calm and thoughtful in one shot and excited in another.",
                "Decide if you’ve got the right personality. Even if you believe that you’ll enjoy modeling and posing for the camera, you should also figure out if you have the right temperament for the job. Many kids are shy around strangers when they’re young, but if you’re modeling, you must be confident and outgoing. You can’t be uncomfortable when you’re working with new agents, photographers, executives, and other crew at each photo shoot.[2]\n\nIf you’re not sure whether you have the personality for modeling, ask yourself if you really like being the center of attention and are able to be yourself even when you’re around people who you don’t know very well.\nIt’s also important to be able to take direction from others and to have enough patience to remain still for as long as 15 minutes when you’re a model.",
                "Talk to your parents. Once you’re sure that you’ll enjoy modeling and have the personality for it, you should talk to your parents about it. Explain to them why you're interested in modeling. You might tell them that you believe it will allow you to express yourself or that you think it will help you feel more confident. You can even just tell them that you think it will be fun to pose for photos. Just be honest and enthusiastic.[3]\n\nIt’s important to understand that allowing you to model requires a big commitment on your parents’ part. They’ll have to take you to casting calls and shoots, and wait around with you while you’re working so they’ll be giving up their time too.\nIf your parents are actually the ones who bring up the idea of modeling, be sure that it’s something that you really want to do. Don’t let them push you into being model if you’re not genuinely interested in it.",
                "Get your parents' permission. As a child, you’ll need your parents’ permission to become a model so you have to get them to agree. They may have concerns about how modeling will affect other parts of your life, so make sure to tell them that school will still be a priority and you’ll continue to get all of your chores done.[4]\n\nConsider making a deal with your parents that you’re only allowed to model if you get certain grades in school and do your part to help around the house.\nMany states require work permits for children under 18 who work as models or in other entertainment fields. When you meet with agencies, they can help you and your parents figure out what documentation you need to work.[5]",
                "Recognize the commitment required. Modeling seems like an exciting job, but you should go into the process understanding that it’s not all fun and games. It may take hours to get just a handful of shots done, and you'll need to give maximum effort the entire time. Shoots often have a lot of downtime too, which means you will probably be sitting around a lot as you wait to pose.[6]\n\nSome clients may try to have their photos shoots during the evenings and weekends, but many jobs will be during the weekday. That means you may have to miss school to model, so if you’re already behind in your classes, it may not be the best fit for you.\nOther photo shoots may require getting up very early and working before school, so make sure you’re willing to change your schedule to model.\nBecause of all the waiting around on shoots, you should be sure to bring supplies to keep you busy. You might bring some schoolwork to do or books to read. It’s also a good idea to bring your favorite snacks and drinks.",
                "Be realistic about your odds of great success. Modeling is very competitive, so you’re going to go up against many other kids who also want to be models. As a result, finding an agency to work with you and jobs may not be that easy. You can't count on being an instant success or making big money, so you shouldn't go into modeling just for the fame and fortune.[7]\n\nTalk to your parents about the expectations for your modeling career. It's important that everyone is on the same page.\nMany models don't get paid a lot. Some get paid as little as ten dollars an hour.",
                "Take a few photos. Unlike teen or adult models, it’s not necessary to have a professional portfolio when you’re trying to become a child model. That’s because kids grow and change so quickly that photographs become outdated in a hurry. Most modeling agencies require only a few photos for submissions. While it always helps to have photos taken by a professional photographer, it’s not necessary. You parents can take the photos of you -- just make sure the lighting is good and use the best camera available to you for clean, clear shots.Try all different filters and poses, and show many different expressions. It would be best to not wear too much makeup, keep it natural. [8]\n\nYour photos should be in color, and a headshot, a full body shot, and a couple of candids.\nTry to look natural in the photos. Don’t wear any silly costumes or hats.\nSome agencies may ask for a composite card, which is a card that contains several small photos.\nMake sure that your parents write your name and theirs, as well as your age, hair color, eye color, clothing size, and address, on the back of each photo.",
                "Identify reputable agencies in your area. Because most clients who are looking for child models don’t do the casting themselves, you’ll need to sign with a modeling agency that can identify jobs you’re right for. It’s important to find agencies in your area, though, because you’ll be expected to travel where the shoot is. Ask your parents to help you do an online search for “modeling agencies” and the name of your town or the closest city. Make sure that the ones you find are registered with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), so you know they’re not a scam.[9]\n\nWhile a modeling agency will take a certain percentage of the earnings that you make for a particular job as their fee, no reputable agency will ever ask for money upfront.\nIn addition to a BBB rating, check the agency’s website to see their portfolio. You want to know that they’ve worked with impressive clients, whether local or national.\nIf you don’t live in a major city, such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, chances are that you’ll be working with agency that books jobs with smaller, local businesses.",
                "Get advice on agencies from other child models and parents. Knowing that an agency is well rated with the BBB is important, but hearing about other models' experiences with the agency can be even more helpful. If you know other child models, ask them how they like working with their agency. Have your parents talk to their parents too, so they can have some of their questions answered.[10]\n\nWhen you're talking to other child models about their agencies, ask how friendly the agents are and how comfortable they feel with the people from the agency. You should also ask how many jobs they've been able to get through the agency.",
                "Submit photos. Once you’ve found some reputable agencies in your area, it’s time to submit your photos. Visit the agencies’ websites to determine what their submission process is. Some agencies will allow you to submit your photos online, while others require you to mail hard copies of the photos. You will probably need to write a letter of interest to go with the photos, so ask your parents to help with that.[11]\n\nIf you’re mailing your photos to an agency, you may also need to include a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a reply.\nIn most cases, you can expect to hear a response from the agencies you’ve submitted to in a month or so. They’ll either send a polite rejection letter or email, or contact your parents to set up a meeting.",
                "Be yourself at meetings. If you’re lucky enough to get a meeting a modeling agency, it’s obviously important to make a good impression. The agents already like the way that you look based on your photos, but they want to make sure you have a fun, outgoing personality to match. That doesn’t mean you should fake it, though. You won’t be able to keep up an act on all of the castings and photo shoots that you go on, so be yourself and let the agent know who you really are.[12]\n\nIf you’re nervous at a meeting, try to pretend that you’re just talking to a friend and not an modeling or casting agent. That may help take some of the pressure off.\nYour parents can sit with you for meetings, which may help you feel more comfortable.\nIt may help to do a practice meeting or interview with an adult other than a family member. Your parents might ask one of their friends to ask you some questions, so you’re more comfortable for your appointment.",
                "Project confidence. If you want agents and casting executives to believe in you, you have to let them know that you believe in yourself. At your meetings, try to use your body language to convey how confident you are. Maintain eye contact with the people that you're meeting with, and sit and stand up straight. Avoid fidgeting too.[13]\n\nAnother way to ensure that you give off a confident vibe is to go into meetings with a positive attitude. Assume that it's going to go well, and the people who you're meeting with will be able to feel that.",
                "Sign with an agency. If a modeling agency likes you, they will want you to sign a contract. The contract lays out the terms of your agreement, including what type of fee the agency will take for your assignments. Your parents will ultimately decide whether the contract is in your best interest and sign on your behalf. They may want a lawyer to read over it before they sign to ensure that it’s a good contract.[14]\n\nMost agencies take approximately 20 percent of models’ earnings as their fee.\nUnless an agency wants you to sign an exclusive contract, which means you work solely with them, you can sign with multiple agencies. That can increase your chance of getting work.",
                "Attend go-sees. When an agency finds modeling jobs that they believe you’re a good fit for, they’ll send you on go-sees, which are meetings with executives from firms that are looking for models. As with your meetings at modeling agencies, the casting agents want to make sure that you don’t just have the right look for the job, but the right personality too. Handle it just as you would a meeting with an agent -- be confident and friendly, but be yourself.[15]\n\nYou may have an appointment for a go-see, which means you can be in and out in as little as 15 minutes. However, if there’s a line, you may wind up waiting around for much longer.\nBecause go-sees are necessary to get jobs, you must attend all the ones that your agent sends you to. Some days, you may have two go-sees, and other times, you may go weeks between go-sees.\nIn some cases, you may receive a modeling job right after you attend a go-see. But it’s not uncommon to have to wait a couple of weeks to hear back.",
                "Prepare yourself for rejection. While modeling can be a lot of fun, there is a part of it that no one likes -- the rejection. Because the field is so competitive, you’re going to be going up against hundreds of other kids who are trying to land a modeling agent or a modeling job. In some cases, you aren’t going to be the best fit for what the agent or client wants. You shouldn’t feel bad about yourself if it takes a while to get a job or if you don’t get a job that you really want. It only means that you aren’t right for that particular job or agency.[16]\n\nIn many cases, advertising firms and other clients are looking for very specific types of children. For example, they may want a redhead with freckles. If you don’t have that look, it doesn’t matter how cute or bubbly you are -- you’re not going to get the job. It isn’t a reflection on you.",
                "Be persistent. If modeling is really something that you want to do, you will need to maintain your confidence even if you aren't getting as many jobs as you'd like. Having success as a model usually requires persistence, so don't give up even if things aren't working out as quickly as you'd hoped.[17]\n\nYou should only continue to pursue modeling if it makes you happy. If the process stops being fun at any point, talk to your parents."

        "How to Grow Honeysuckle": {
            "intro": "Honeysuckle is a low maintenance plant. It is available in two varieties: a fragrant climbing honeysuckle or a beautiful woody shrub. Both varieties require full sunshine and yield glorious flowers in yellows, golds, whites, pinks, and reds. The climbing variety is often trained to grow up fences, walls, trellises, and stakes.",
            "steps": [
                "Select a sunny, moist spot. While honeysuckle plants can tolerate partial-shade, they flourish in the sun. If possible, choose to plant your honeysuckle in a location that receives full sun. The site you choose should also have soil that retains some moisture—excess water should drain off.[1]\n\nWithout sunshine, honeysuckle plants will not flower profusely and they may shed their leaves.[2]",
                "Install supports for your plants if needed. Once you have selected the location, determine if the plant will serve as ground cover or if the honeysuckle will climb up a support structure. If you intend to use the plant as ground cover, you will not need to install a support structure. If you would like to train the honeysuckle to climb, you will either need to plant it near an existing wall or fence, or install a trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. If you are not planting your honeysuckle near an existing fence or wall, Insert the support structure into the ground prior to planting the honeysuckle.\n\n\nIf you install the structure after placing the plant in the ground, you may damage the root system.[3]",
                "Plant the honeysuckle in the early spring. After the threat of frost has passed in the spring, you may plant the honeysuckle in your garden. If you are using the honeysuckle as ground cover, plant them between two and five feet apart. If you are training your honeysuckle, place each plant six to twelve inches away from the support structure and three to fifteen feet away from other plants.[4]\n\nDig a hole as deep as the plant’s current root system. The hole should be two to three times wider than its container.\nCombine new compost into the soil you removed from the hole.\nRemove the honeysuckle from its container without damaging the root system.\nLoosen the plant’s soil with your fingertips before placing it in the hole.\nScoop half of the soil-compost mixture into the hole. Water the area to remove unwanted air pockets. Allow all of the water to drain.\nFill in the rest of the hole with soil-compost mix.\nWater your transplanted honeysuckle thoroughly.\nIf you are training your honeysuckle, attach the plant to the support structure with old nylon hosiery tied in a figure eight. The crossed part of the tie should lay between the stem and the support structure.[5]",
                "Care for your honeysuckle. There are several actions you can take to ensure the health and prosperity of your honeysuckle plant. These include:\n\n\nImmediately after planting, cover the base of the honeysuckle with a two-inch layer of compost, followed by a layer of mulch. The mulch will help the soil retain water.\nIf your region receives less than one inch of rain per week, water the honeysuckle plant.\nAfter your honeysuckle has flowered, prune the plant.[6]",
                "Find a large container. When you plant honeysuckle in a container, the pot must be large enough to accommodate the plant’s growing root system. Select a container that is two to three times larger than the honeysuckle’s current pot.\n\n\nIf you intend to install a support system within the pot, the container will also have to accommodate for the trellis or stakes.[7]",
                "Plant the honeysuckle in the container. Fill your large pot approximately halfway full of soil and/or compost. Carefully remove the honeysuckle from its plastic container without damaging its root system. Insert the plant into the large pot so that the base of the plant sits flush with the lip of the container. Fill in the empty space with more soil and/or compost.\n\n\nIf you need to elevate the honeysuckle, add more soil or compost to the pot until the plant’s base reaches the lip of the container.[8]\n\nThe type of honeysuckle you choose to plant is dependent upon the size of the container you wish to use, the climate of your region, and availability at local nurseries, markets, and stores. Before you purchase a honeysuckle, make sure the variety is not considered invasive.[9]",
                "Install a support system. In order to train your honeysuckle to climb, you must provide it with a support structure. You may position the container next to a south-facing wall or fence. If this option is not available to you, you may install a trellis or set of stakes within the pot itself.\n\n\nYou can create a makeshift cage out of three bamboo dowels and nursery wire. Insert the three dowels along the inner edge of the container at even intervals. Wrap a piece of nursery wire around the top of the three dowels. Cover the rest of the structure—from its top to its base—with five to seven rings of nursery wire.",
                "Train your honeysuckle. Once your structure is in place, you can train the plant to climb up the trellis, stakes, wall, or fence. Wrap the plant’s vines around the support structure. You can attach the honeysuckle to the structure with old nylon hosiery.[10]\n\nIf you have not already done so, move the honeysuckle to a sunny location and water the plant.",
                "Take cuttings from a honeysuckle plant. You can start a new honeysuckle plant from a cutting, or portion of an existing plant, treated with root hormone. Remove six to eight inch pieces of vine from your honeysuckle plant with a sharp knife. The cut you make should be slanted as opposed to straight across. If possible, separate the cutting from the vine just below a leaf node, or the portion of the stem that produces leaves. Remove the lowest two sets of leaves.\n\n\nTake your cuttings from a plant that is at least two years old.[11]",
                "Remove the stem’s outer layer. With a knife, carefully scrape off the top layer of the stem. You do not need to remove the entire layer, only the portion that spans from the base of the cutting to the lowest leaf node. This distance will be approximately two inches.\n\n\nThis step is optional and should be avoided if you do not have a steady hand.[12]",
                "Treat the cuttings with root hormone. Root hormone is used to enhance the growth of plant’s roots. Place a small amount of powder or liquid root hormone into a clean disposable dish. Dip two inches of the cutting into the root hormone. Tap the excess product off on the side of the dish.[13]\n\nRoot hormone is commonly used on cuttings, like honeysuckle, that generate roots rather slowly.[14]",
                "Plant and cover your cutting. Fill a small container with fresh soil or compost. Insert the cutting two inches into the fresh soil. Stick a bamboo skewer into the soil approximately half an inch away from the cutting. Water the cutting. Cover the plant with a plastic bag and seal the bag with a rubber band.\n\n\nThe bamboo stick with keep the bag off of the cutting.[15]",
                "Let your honeysuckle take root. Once the cuttings are planted, relocate the containers to a bright, sunny sport. Within two to three weeks, the cuttings should produce roots. To check their progress, lightly tug on the cutting to see if it is attached to the soil. When the roots are at least one inch long, you may transplant them to a larger pot or into your garden.\n\n\nDon’t forget to water your cuttings. The soil should remain moist, not damp or dry.[16]",
                "Monitor your new plants for disease and pests. Honeysuckles are susceptible to certain diseases and pests. The most common of these are powder mildew and aphids. Watch your honeysuckles closely to look for molding, mildew, bite marks, and other damage that could indicate a problem with your new plant.\n\nPowder mildew attacks plants that don't have sufficient water. Prevent it by watering your plant regularly and keeping the soil moist and well drained.\nAphids feed on the leaves of the plant. They are typically treated with insecticide soaps for large infestations. However, if you only have a few of them you can spray them away with a garden hose.\nOther insects, including scale insects, spider mites, and caterpillars, can also impact your honeysuckles. You will need to remove any pests and eggs, using insecticide as necessary, along with removing injured leaves.",
                "Purchase or collect honeysuckle seeds. Honeysuckle seeds are not available in every region, at every nursery, or through every seed catalogue. If you can not find a supplier and you have access to a honeysuckle plant, you may collect the seeds directly from the spent flowers.\n\n\nHoneysuckle seeds are found in pods. When the pods become dry and brittle, they are ready for harvest. Ripe pods should snap off the stem and split a small amount when squeezed.[17]",
                "Dry the seeds. After harvesting the pods, the wet seeds need to dry. Dry the seeds in a well ventilated room. The room should be kept at a temperature between 70 and 95℉. After two to six weeks, the seeds will be ready to plant.\n\n\nYou can dry the seeds in a closed paper bag, an open plastic cup, or a mixing bowl covered with a piece of screen, lightweight fabric, or cheesecloth.[18]",
                "Plant the seeds. Fill a small container with moist perlite soil. Sprinkle or place the seeds on top of the soil. Water the seeds immediately. The seeds will germinate within fifteen days.\n\n\nThe seeds must be wet to germinate, or transform from a seed to a seedling. Check the soil every day to determine if the seeds need additional water.[19]"

        "wikiHow to Tell Your Family You Want to Join the Military": {
            "intro": "Telling your family you want to join the military can be difficult, because they may react with anger, fear, sadness, and other emotions that you can’t control. But even if you’re scared, it’s still important that you talk to your family. To make the discussion easier, do your research in advance and have solid reasons to back up your decision, prepare for the discussion by having answers to the most common questions that family members often ask, and be open and honest about your choice.",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare for the discussion. Your family is going to have a lot of questions, and they're going to want to know how and why you’ve reached this decision. To prepare for the discussion, think about a few questions they might have and write down your answers in advance. Your family will want to know:[1]\n\nWhat branch of the military you want to join\nIf there's a specific job you're aiming for\nHow long of a commitment it will be\nWhat kind of training and education you'll get\nWhy you want to join\nHow long you'll be away from home\nWhat it means for your future\nHow often you'll be able to see them",
                "Tell a trusted family member first. If you're worried that your family might not be happy about your decision, it can help to have the support of one or two close family members before you tell everyone else.\n\n\nChoose a family member or close relative that you think will be sympathetic and understanding of your decision.\nYour confidant can help you brainstorm questions you should prepare for, and get you ready for reactions that you might expect.\nYou may even want to have a practice conversation with this family member in advance to help prepare you for the real talk with everyone else.[2]\n\nHowever, don’t try to determine what the conversation will actually be like, otherwise you might be thrown off guard if your family reacts in a way you didn’t expect.",
                "Schedule a family meeting with your immediate family. A family meeting is a good way to get your family together so you can talk to them all at the same time about your decision. You don’t have to include extended family, but you should discuss your decision with parents, siblings, and children.\n\n\nTalk to your family in advance and let them know you want to get everyone together. Schedule a time when everyone is free.\nIdeally, make the meeting on a weekend, or at a time when everyone has had a couple hours to relax after work or school.\nIf there are immediate family members who live out of town or far away, consider including them through a conference call or video chat.[3]",
                "Tell them the choice you’ve made. When the time comes for your meeting and you're ready to tell everyone that you want to join the military, it’s best to come right out and say it. They will surely continue the dialogue afterward by asking questions. To start, say something clear and understandable,[4] such as:\n\n\n“I want to join the military”\n“I have been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and have come to the conclusion that I'm joining the military”\n“After thinking long and hard, I’ve realized my calling is the military”",
                "Tell your family what you need from them. Part of this discussion involves getting help from your family as well. You can facilitate this process by telling them how they can support you. This may include:[5]\n\nTelling them how they can keep in touch, such as by letters, phone calls, or emails\nDeciding how often you want to talk to them when you're away\nHaving them be available for you to talk to and share news with\nHaving them be excited for you, even if they don’t agree with your decision",
                "Describe your reasons. Unless you can explain your decision, your family may think that you aren't serious, that you haven't thought this through, or that you aren't ready. Use the research you’ve done to explain to them:[6]\n\nWhat kind of job you're aiming for\nThe pay scale and career path\nThe opportunities this choice will create for you\nWhat you expect to gain from the experience\nThat you understand the risks involved",
                "Answer questions openly and honestly. The more candid you are, the more likely your family is to accept your decision. If you're secretive or unwilling to answer questions, they may assume the worst, and will think that you're not making the right choice.\n\n\nFor example, if you don’t explain your decision, your family may think you're just trying to run away from something and don’t want to involve them.\nHave answers prepared for the why-type questions you'll be asked, such as why you want to join the military.\nDon’t make up answers. Instead, if someone asks a question you can’t yet answer, tell them you'll figure it out and respond later.",
                "Be ready if your family tries to prohibit you from joining. As long as you meet the requirements, your family can’t actually stop you from joining the military. Although they may, try, ultimately the decision is yours, and only you can decide what's right for your life. However, it’s still important to listen to your family’s concerns. Some of the criteria for enlisting may include:[7]\n\nYou must be 18 years old, or 17 and have parental consent.\nHeight and weight restrictions\nAcademic qualifications",
                "React to guilt accordingly. Some people try to get their way by inducing feelings of guilt in others. If your family tries to make you feel guilty about joining the military in an attempt to change your mind, there are ways you can manage this tactic.[8]\n\nRestate how important this is to you.\nLet them know that you see what they're trying to do and don’t appreciate it.\nAsk them to reframe their concerns in a way that doesn’t involve making you feel guilty\nReframe guilt as gratitude. Interpret this guilt trip as a sign that your family cares for you and wants the best for you.",
                "Understand your family may be concerned about violence. When you join the military, there is a chance that you may have to kill someone else, destroy someone’s home, or that you yourself will be killed in the line of duty. Your family knows this, and they may become preoccupied with the violence associated with a life in the military.\n\n\nLet them know that according to three decades worth of statistical tracking, only about 0.082 percent of enlisted service members die in the military.[9]\n\nYou can also remind them that it’s possible that you may also never be deployed and may never see war, depending on what happens in the world during your time in the military and your duties there.",
                "Realize your family may panic. Your family loves you and cares about you, and that’s why they're perhaps scared, angry, and panicking about your decision. It’s important that you remain calm, otherwise emotions will run higher and the discussion could escalate.\n\n\nUnderstand that panic is a common reaction to a family member joining the military, especially if there's a good chance you'll be deployed.[10]\n\nReassure your family that you love them, but that you need to do this. But don’t become angry or heated yourself, as this will only increase tension.\nUse active listening techniques to hear your family out. While a member of your family is speaking, look them in the eyes, nod at what they're saying, and focus on what they're saying (not what you're going to say to respond).[11]\n\nHelp your family calm down by using a soft, love voice. Show them that you understand their panic and concern.[12] For example, you could say, \"I understand that you're worried about my safety, but this life decision is really important to me.\"",
                "Talk to a recruiter. The job of a recruiter is to advertise the army, talk to applicants and potential enlistees, convince people to enlist, conduct interviews, and assess applicants.[13] A recruiter will be able to answer questions, explain the process, and can take your information to get the ball rolling.\n\n\nTo find a recruiter near you, visit the U.S. Army website.[14]\n\nIf you're having trouble talking to your family about your decision, you can also request that a recruiter come to your home to talk and answer questions.[15]",
                "Talk to other people who have served. While recruiters will be able to answer your questions, they are biased because it’s their job to convince you to join the military. To get a well-rounded perspective on what life in the military will really be like, talk to people who have served and who aren't being paid to recruit you.\n\n\nRecently discharged veterans are good candidates, friends or family members, or a civilian counselor.[16]\n\nAsk about what it’s like, whether they enjoyed their time in the military, and whether they would recommend it for someone else.",
                "Understand reasons why people wouldn’t want you to join the military. Your family might have a lot of reasons for their concerns, and knowing the pros and cons of joining the military will help you make the most informed decision. Understand that joining the military:[17]\n\nWon’t alleviate problems in your life, and will only put them on hold\nIsn't necessarily the only way to obtain an affordable education\nMeans you might have to go to war\nDemands that your actions are controlled by your superiors",
                "Find out how your skills will apply to civilian life. People often join the military for the job training that they’ll receive, but this won’t necessarily be applicable training once you leave the military and rejoin civilian life.\n\n\nWhen you're looking at joining, examine the job descriptions you're considering and ask yourself how those skills would translate to a civilian workplace.[18]\n\nAlso, be warned that many employers are hesitant to hire veterans, and this may make it difficult for you to get a job when you leave the military.[19]",
                "Determine how much money you can get for education. The amount you'll get is based on the amount of time you spend on active duty,[20] so you may have to extend an initial four-year contract beyond that to ensure your education is paid for.\n\n\nTalk to a counselor or recruiter about what tuition assistance is available from that branch of the military, and how long you'd have to serve to have your education paid for.",
                "Figure out if you're prepared for the worst. When you join the military, you sign a contract that dictates the number of years you have to serve. Many first-term contracts are six years long,[21] and during this time you might:\n\n\nBe deployed to a foreign country\nHave to fight and kill\nHave to risk your life[22]\n\nSuffer psychologically, including from things like post-traumatic stress disorder"

        "wikiHow to Recognize Gout Symptoms": {
            "intro": "Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that is very painful and commonly impacts the big toe joint, but can also affect joints in the other toes, plus your ankles, knees, fingers, wrists, and elbows.[1] You may feel a lot of pain and discomfort in one or more of these joints for a short period of time and often at night.[2] Gout is caused by an excess of uric acid (hyperuricemia) in the blood. Sometimes, uric acid crystallizes and accumulates in the joints, causing pain and tenderness. By closely observing the level of comfort and mobility in your joints, as well as identifying patterns in your pain and identifying any risk factors, you should be able to better recognize gout symptoms and seek effective medical treatment.",
            "steps": [
                "Touch your big toe. Ask yourself whether it feels very sensitive and painful. Pain and discomfort in the big toe is a common sign of gout.[3]",
                "Review the comfort of your toes, ankles, knees, fingers, wrists, and elbows. Consider whether any of these joints feel uncomfortable or painful. Gout can impact any joint in the body but most commonly manifests in these joints. If you are experiencing discomfort in one or more of these joints, your doctor may come to the conclusion that you have gout.[4]",
                "Consider whether your joint feels hot and tender. Touch your joint and feel whether it is hot and tender. If so, you may be experiencing a symptom that is common with gout.[5]",
                "Check for swelling in and around the joint. If you see redness and swelling of the joint, you are experiencing another symptom that is commonly associated with gout.[6]",
                "Look for red and shiny skin where you are experiencing pain. If the skin around the joint is very red and shiny, you have another symptom of gout.[7]\n\nConsider whether your skin looks very red around your joints, which is also common with gout.",
                "Look for peeling or flaky skin around the joint. This symptom is also commonly associated with gout.[8]\n\nCheck if the skin is flaking off your ankles or toes. If you have a lot of flaky skin, this could be a sign of gout.",
                "Ask yourself whether you have limited mobility in the impacted joint. This is another common symptom of gout.[9]\n\nFor instance, try wiggling your big toe up and down. If you are able to do this movement without pain, it is a good sign. If you are able to move it all the way up and all the way down, it is also a good sign; however, if you are unable to move it freely and without pain, you may be experiencing gout.",
                "Determine if your pain is mostly at night. Although the pain of a gout attack can come at any time of the day, most people experience it the worst at night.[10]",
                "Record the intensity of your symptoms. Determine whether your joints feel very painful all of a sudden and for a few hours at a time. Gout attacks typically develop fast and over a few hours at the beginning stages of the condition.[11]\n\nAn acute gout attack will be most painful about 12 to 24 hours after it starts.[12]",
                "Record the total duration of your painful attacks. Typically, a gout attack will last between three and 10 days. If the attack is not treated, it will last longer.\n\n\nTry recording the duration of your symptoms in a health journal.",
                "Figure out whether your symptoms are becoming worse over time. If untreated, gout symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) will become worse over time. If you are experiencing these symptoms, you should see a doctor.[13]",
                "Figure out whether you are in a high risk demographic. Typically, men are at a higher risk for gout than women and the level of risk increases with age. So, older men are definitely at an increased risk for gout. The risk for gout increases significantly for women who have already gone through menopause.[14]\n\nMen are at highest risk of developing gout between the ages of 30 and 50.[15]",
                "Look into whether you have a family history of gout. Figure out whether your father, mother, grandparents, or great grandparents experienced gout. You could ask your parents or other family members if they know of any family history of gout. If you have a family history of gout, you are more at risk of getting it.[16]",
                "Find out if you are overweight. If you are too heavy, your body makes more uric acid and your kidneys have a harder time getting rid of it. These factors make you more susceptible to gout.\n\n\nUse a body mass index calculator online. This index is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. Enter your height and weight into an online body mass index calculator, and then hit “calculate.” You can then compare your body mass index to the healthy index projected for your age and sex.[17]\n\nAsk your doctor to determine whether you are overweight. Your doctor has a number of different measurements and tools that they can use to determine your current and healthy weight.",
                "Assess your diet with a food diary.[18] Write down everything you eat for one week in order to determine your level of consumption of meat, seafood, sugar, and alcohol. Once you have tracked your level of consumption of these items for one week, you should review your patterns of consumption (e.g., how often you drink sugary soft drinks and at what times of the day). If you regularly consume a lot of meat, sugar, and alcohol, you are at a higher risk for gout.[19]\n\nFindings suggest that if men maintain a diet that has a lot of sugar from soft drinks they are more likely to get gout. Drinking soft drinks on a daily basis will greatly increase your risk.[20]\n\nEating a diet with a lot of meat and seafood (high-purine foods) is a risk factor for gout.\nAlcohol consumption is a trigger for gout attacks. Drinking will likely trigger an attack within 24 hours and your risk increases relative to the amount you drink.[21]\n\nIf you are unsure of your diet, you could go see a dietitian or doctor. It can help to bring your food diary with you, so they have an idea of how much sugar, meat, and alcohol you currently consume.[22]",
                "Assess medications that may increase risk. Medications used to treat hypertension as well as drugs that suppress the immune system, such as those prescribed to people to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or who have undergone an organ transplant can sometimes increase the risk of gout.[23]",
                "Reflect on your recent history of surgery and trauma. If you have recently experienced surgery or trauma, you may also be at a higher risk for gout.[24] If you have any kind of surgery, you are at an increased risk.[25]\n\nUndergoing chemotherapy can also be a trigger for gout.[26]"

        "wikiHow to Test Fuel Injectors": {
            "intro": "The fuel injectors in your vehicle are designed to spray fuel into the cylinders of your engine where it is combined with air and compressed before being ignited by the spark plug to produce power. As a result, an issue with one of your fuel injectors can cause your engine to run poorly, or even fail to run at all. There are a number of issues that could cause your fuel injectors to fail. Although some may be beyond the expertise of most home mechanics, you can often diagnose a faulty fuel injector using common hand tools.",
            "steps": [
                "Put on the appropriate safety gear. Before beginning any automotive project, you need to take steps to protect yourself from injury. Eye protection like safety glasses or goggles will keep debris from falling or spraying into your eyes while you work. Choose eye protection that fits comfortably and won't interfere with your vision. Gloves are an optional addition to the safety gear required for this task.[1]\n\nGloves can protect your hands from sharp objects or pinches while working in the engine bay.\nEye protection is required for this project.",
                "Open the hood and locate your fuel injectors. The easiest way to locate the fuel injectors for your specific vehicle is to refer to the service manual for that vehicle. Most applications have one fuel injector for each cylinder. They are usually located on the intake manifold and are connected to one another with a fuel rail.[2]\n\nThe fuel rail is a cylindrical rail that will run along the top of the intake manifold, and each fuel injector will be between the fuel rail and the intake manifold.\nV style engines (V6, V8, V10) will have two fuel rails with half of the injectors on each side of the motor.",
                "Find a long metal rod or screwdriver. Locate a thin piece of metal that’s at least a foot or so long. It should be made mostly of metal, but you could opt to use a screwdriver despite it having a plastic or rubber handle.[3]\n\nMake sure the piece you choose is at least a foot long, but not more than two feet.\nA long screwdriver or thin piece of rebar will work fine.",
                "Place the tip of the rod on a fuel injector. You will be using the metal rod to transmit sound from the fuel injector to your ear without having to bring your face too close to a running engine. Set one end of the rod or screwdriver on the injector itself while holding it up with one hand.[4]\n\nMake sure to hold the screwdriver or metal rod at an angle that will allow you to bring your ear to it.",
                "Bring your ear close to the rod and listen for clicking. Lean your ear close to the end of the metal rod or screwdriver that is opposite the injector. As the engine runs, listen for an audible clicking sound given off by the injector. This sound indicates the injector being activated.[5]\n\nBe extremely careful leaning your head into the engine bay, and ensure you keep your eyes open as you listen to the rod to prevent accidentally getting injured.\nIf you have long hair, tie it back tightly to prevent it from getting caught in any moving parts under the hood.",
                "Repeat these steps for each injector. Use the same method to check each fuel injector in your vehicle. If you find one that is not clicking, there is an issue with the injector or the electronic control that is transmitting to the injector.[6]\n\nIf you have an OBDII scanner and your vehicle’s check engine light is on, you can check to see if there have been any errors in the vehicle’s computer regarding that cylinder or injector.\nReplacing this injector may solve the problem, but you may also need to have a diagnostic done of your vehicle’s electronic control unit and fuel system by a professional mechanic.",
                "Turn the key to the “on” position without starting the engine. To conduct this test, the vehicle's electrical system must be active without the engine actually running. Insert the key and turn it until the electrical system activates, but stop before you engage the engine's starter. This should activate all of the vehicle’s electronics like interior lighting and the radio.[7]\n\nIf you accidentally start the vehicle, simply turn it off and try again.\nThe vehicle’s battery is powering everything during this test, so you should turn off things like the headlights and stereo to converse power and ensure it has enough to start the vehicle again later.",
                "Connect a test light to the negative terminal on the battery. A test light looks like a screwdriver with a finely pointed end and a wire hanging out of the handle. When the wire from the handle and the pointed end come into contact with a completed and powered circuit, a lightbulb lights up inside the handle of the test light. The wire extending from the handle will have an alligator clip at the end. Attach that alligator clip to the negative terminal of the vehicle’s battery.[8]\n\nYou can identify the negative terminal on the battery by looking for the negative symbol (-) or the letters NEG.\nMake sure the clip has a good metal on metal connection to make the test light work.",
                "Locate the two wires going into each injector. Each fuel injector will have a metal clip plugged into it with two wires coming out of it. One of those two wires is a 12-volt constant that should be continuously receiving power from your vehicle’s electrical system. There should be a small portion of each wire exposed coming out of the plastic clip that connects to the injector.[9]\n\nThese wires are often grey and black, but can come in any number of colors.\nThey will be the only wires coming from each injector.",
                "Test each wire for voltage. Take the sharp end of the test light and press it firmly into the rubber coating around each wire until it penetrates into the metal wiring itself. One of the two wires should make the test light turn on when it comes into contact with the wire inside the protective coating. If the test light turns on with one wire, then the injector is receiving the necessary constant voltage.[10]\n\nMake sure to wrap a piece of electric tape around any holes in the wiring’s protective coating that are big enough to see.\nIf neither wire makes the light turn on, then there is an issue with the power reaching the fuel injector, which will result in in failing to fire.\nIf the all of the wires that light up are a certain color, make note of which wires are the constants.",
                "Repeat the process for each injector. Test each wire coming out of the fuel injectors in your vehicle. If you locate one injector with a power issue, that doesn’t mean others may not have the same problem. Once you identify an injector with a power issue, make a note of which one it was and continue to test the rest.[11]\n\nFollow the wires on the injectors that fail to engage the test light to make sure there are no breaks in the wire that may prevent the electricity from reaching it.\nLet your mechanic know that you were able to identify the injector with a power issue. It may require replacing the vehicle’s electronic control unit.",
                "Connect a test light to the positive terminal of the battery. Take the same test light that you used for the previous test, but this time connect the alligator clip to the positive terminal on the battery instead of the negative.[12]\n\nYou can identify the positive terminal by looking for the positive sign (+) on the battery or the letters POS.\nMake sure the alligator clip has secure, metal on metal contact or the test light will fail to function.",
                "Have a friend start or turnover the engine. Have a friend start the engine. If the vehicle won’t currently run, have your friend attempt to turn it over as you test each injector. Make sure you do not have any clothing or body parts hanging into the engine bay as it starts or turns over.[13]\n\nIf the engine won’t start, remember that attempting to turn it over for too long can kill the battery and damage the starter. Only attempt to turn it over with the test light in place.",
                "Probe the opposite wire with the test light. Use the test light and check the opposite wire of the constants you identified in the previous test. Press the sharp end of the probe through the rubber coating firmly until it makes contact with the metal wire inside.[14]\n\nBe careful not to press the probe all the way through the wire and out the other side.\nAlways cover holes in the wire’s protective coating with electric tape once you’re done.",
                "Look for flashing or flickering light. With the engine running at an idle, the test light should flicker dimly and as your helper applies throttle by pressing the gas pedal, the light should flicker more brightly. This light represents the signal being transmitted by the ECU to the injector to spray fuel. If the test light is failing to light up, the injector may be bad or there could be an issue with the electronic control unit for the vehicle.[15]\n\nThis issue could be caused by a failing ECU, or one of the injectors along the fuel rail may be faulty.\nThe electrical pulse is transmitted through each of the injectors to one another, so one faulty injector could cause issues in multiple injectors.",
                "Disconnect the wiring clips to each injector and begin the test again. With none of the injectors connected, the flickering pulse should transmit through all of the wires without any issue. Use the test light to confirm this on the wire for the last fuel injector clip (at the end of the fuel rail). Keep the test light connected as you reconnect each fuel injector one by one. As you connect each injector, the pulse intensity should remain the same. It shouldn’t change until you connect a faulty injector that creates too much resistance for the pulse to travel through easily. [16]\n\nWhen the pulsing light dims as you connect one of the injectors, that injector is faulty and needs to be replaced.\nYou can purchase new fuel injectors for your vehicle at most auto parts stores."

        "wikiHow to Get An Elderly Person to Bathe or Shower": {
            "intro": "When you are faced with an elderly person who is reluctant to take a bath or shower, it can be difficult to know where to begin with trying to change their routine. But if you approach the situation carefully, you should be able to encourage the person to try bathing more—mainly in the interest of better health, but also just for the pleasure of it. Start by learning the possible reasons behind the person's insufficient bathing habits. Then make suggestions for a change in routine, offering to assist or find assistance for them when washing. Finally, inspect the bathroom to ensure the easiest, safest, and most comfortable bathing experience for the person.",
            "steps": [
                "Be aware that poor hygiene is not always a choice. As people age, bathing may become difficult. This may be due to a fear of falling, difficulty getting in or out of the tub or shower, difficulty washing themselves, or even a result of a cognitive disorder, such as Alzheimer’s or dementia.[1][2] As you start to approach an elderly family member or friend about their hygiene, keep all of these things in mind and aim to be as respectful and tactful as possible.",
                "Get an idea of the person’s general grooming habits. Approaching the situation indirectly will avoid putting too much pressure on your loved one or client. It is important to make them feel comfortable before going about suggesting a change in routine, which for many elderly can be upsetting and difficult.\n\n\nFor example, you can begin by asking whether they have enough grooming supplies, and if they respond yes, ask,”Well is that enough soap for your showers and baths this week? How many would you say you take on average?”, or if they respond no, “Just to get an idea for when I’m shopping, how many baths or showers a week should we restock you for?”",
                "Suggest a change in routine. If you find out that they’re bathing fewer than two times a week, change your tone of voice from casually inquisitive to concerned. Approach the issue from a medical, rather than a personal, standpoint, stressing the importance of hygiene to overall health.\n\n\nExplain that doctors recommend bathing at least twice a week to prevent infection.[3] Try something like, “You know I’ve heard on the news / from my doctor that not only should everyone bathe every week, they should bathe at least twice a week for better health. I think we should give this a try.”",
                "Avoid mentioning any issues with odor. Bringing up body odor might disappoint or anger them, making it more difficult to convince them to change their routine. And since seniors can have a decreased sense of smell, they might not be aware that there is an odor problem.[4] Pointing this out to them could cause anxiety if they’re unable to detect the odor and might wonder about it.",
                "Ask the person about their concerns and needs regarding bathing. Depending on their physical condition, bathing or showering may be a source of anxiety—undressing, getting in and out of the tub, washing, drying off, and dressing might require more energy than they have. They may be afraid of falling in the tub, have had a bad experience with scalding or icy-cold water, or easily lose track of time.[5] Take note of these for consideration when arranging for help with washing, and improving bathroom safety.\n\n\nTo try to understand what anxieties they may have, ask questions such as, “Have you been hurt while using the tub, by falling, or by the temperature of the water?” or “Do you feel really tired after washing?” If fatigue or fear of falling seem to be issues, strongly consider either bathing the person yourself or hiring a caregiver.",
                "Give them an incentive to wash. If your loved one hasn’t been washing frequently enough, it’s likely they don’t feel the need to because they aren’t going out or seeing people regularly. You can give them an extra incentive to bathe by encouraging them to make plans. Go beyond simply suggesting things to do, and mark out specific plans with them on a calendar.\n\n\nOutings and activities that are easy arrange include lunch with friends or family, going to the movies or a musical performance, or a trip to the park.[6]",
                "Offer to help them wash. Even if they prefer to wash themselves, it’s safest to supervise your loved one for at least the first couple of washing sessions. Stress that you only want to be there to set things up and ensure safety, with the possibility of letting them wash on their own after making sure they feel safe.\n\n\nIf you do help the person bathe, then try using tactful questions to help them with the bathing process. For example, you might ask things like, what kind of soap do you prefer? Do you need a washcloth? Is the water warm enough?\nYou can also make tactful suggestions during the bathing process, such as, “Here’s the soap for washing your body.” Or, “I’m going to hand you the shampoo next so you can wash your hair.”[7]",
                "Ask suggestive questions to arrange a washing time. Instead of asking whether or not they want to bathe, pose your questions in a way that assumes they want to. Avoid yes or no questions, such as \"Do you want to bathe or not?\"--in addition to coming off as testy, this omits the assumption that more bathing should be done.\n\n\nFor example, you can ask “When should I come back to help you with your bath?” or “What time of the day suits you best for showering?”",
                "Arrange for help with washing. Depending on your relationship with the person, they may feel awkward about your helping them with such a private routine. If the person is living with a spouse or partner, first suggest that the spouse or partner help them bathe. If the pair seem open to this, begin by discussing and establishing a routine with both of them. Mark the washing days (at least two per week) on the calendar.",
                "Schedule a caregiver. If the person can’t bathe alone and is uncomfortable with a family member helping out, hiring a caregiver for home visits is the best option. These services are widely available in most communities. Search your directory or the internet for “In-Home Health Provider” or “Home Health Care.”[8] Schedule a bathing session for at least twice a week, marking it on a calendar that is easily visible (attached to the refrigerator, hanging on a wall in the kitchen).\n\n\nThe idea of an unfamiliar person helping them to wash could be worrisome. Assure them that the caregiver is a professional, and is specifically trained to help people take care of themselves.\nRegardless of who helps with washing, remind the loved one that bathing can be a pleasant, refreshing experience and is important to staying healthy.",
                "Set a regular washing schedule. Whether it’s you, a spouse, or a caregiver who will be helping, putting washing times on the calendar will help the loved one to improve their memory, and get a better sense of the week’s activities. When you or the caregiver arrives, it’s “bath time,” an event as expected and routine as dinnertime or bedtime.[9]",
                "Check in to make sure that washing is taking place as planned. If you’re not the one helping with washing, either ask the spouse or partner whether the schedule is being followed, or call the in-home agency to make sure the treatment is running smoothly.\n\n\nIf the person is washing themselves, an easy way to make sure they’re using the bath regularly is to check the soap bar size and body wash / shampoo bottle levels to see whether they’ve been used.\nSince you’ve already completed the difficult task of asking them about hygiene, it should be easier at this point to casually ask whether they’ve been keeping to the new bathing schedule you’d agreed on.",
                "Consult a doctor if you meet resistance. It’s possible that your loved one will refuse to bathe, despite repeated attempts on your part to explain the benefits and to offer to help. In this case, consult a family doctor, and ask about medications that are designed to ease resistance to care.[10]",
                "Install grab bars as needed. These can be very reassuring, and helpful for a person who has already fallen or is afraid of falling in the bathtub. They should be readily available at a pharmacy or bath supply store.",
                "Install a tub bench / shower chair if the person can’t sit down in the tub. These are especially useful if there has already been a fall, or if there is apprehension about falling because of frailty or fatigue.[11] Pharmacies or bath supply stores are again the best places to shop for these.",
                "Add a non-slip mat or apply anti-slip tape to the base of the tub. Many bathtubs may already have this sandpaper-textured tape affixed to the bottom of the tub, but it could help to add more in the middle area where most of the standing is done when showering. Non-slip mats (for drying off) are available for the floor just outside the tub as well.[12]",
                "Install a handheld shower head. This will give the person more control while washing. It is also much safer, since it prevents falls by 1) eliminating the need to maneuver under the shower head to wash hard-to-reach areas, and 2) allowing them to sit in a shower chair while washing.[13]",
                "Ensure the proper functioning of the water system. Test the water temperature by hand. Let both the hot and cold water run for a few minutes each to check for major temperature fluctuations. If the temperature changes from hot to cold frequently, contact the landlord or hire a plumber to resolve the problem.\n\n\nIf the person lives in an apartment, it’s best to do the test in the early morning when other residents will be showering, and fluctuations would be most common.\nCheck the water heater’s temperature gauge, and make sure it is set to 120 degrees. This should help prevent scalding temperatures.[14]"

The other columns should be labeled each day of the week.\n\n\nFor example, if you wake up at 7am and go to bed at 11pm then the first row in the left column should read 7am. Then continue down the column in one hour increments until you reach 11pm.\nTry creating individual spreadsheets for everyone in the family so that everyone can stay more organized.",
                "Block out fixed hours. Go through the document and indicate times that are already occupied with an activity[1] For example, if your lunch hour is 12pm-1pm then be sure to indicate that on your schedule.

In fact, recreation has been associated with benefits to health related to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.[2] It has also been known to reduce stress level. Therefore, be intentional about scheduling in recreation around the other fixed hours. Some great recreational activities include:\n\n\nRecreational Sports\nActivities at the YMCA\nChurch activities\nPrograms at local parks and community centers\nConsider scheduling in some recreational time with the entire family. There are a lot of family programs that will meet the recreational needs of the entire family.",
                "Prioritize events and deal with unexpected changes. You may have your schedule set only to have a last-minute request or obligation pop up, or the timing might change for an event that conflicts with something else on your schedule. This is nothing to panic over — remember, life is unpredictable! You'll need to learn how to prioritize and rank each task to decide what is most important.\n\nThink about whether or not you can reschedule a task or event for another time, if you feel the task is important or necessary, what you can delegate to another person, etc.",
                "Try your schedule out for one week. Be sure to monitor if you’ve allotted yourself enough time for certain activities. For example, did you give yourself enough time to commute to and from work or do you find that you’re often late or racing to get there on time?",
                "Make necessary revisions. Create a revised schedule based upon the problems that you note in your original schedule.[3] This way your schedule will be more reflective of your actual reality.\n\n\nFor example, if you find that you are consistently arriving to work 15 minutes late, then your revised schedule should add an additional 20 minutes of commute time.",
                "Determine your bedtime. It’s important to choose a bedtime based upon how much sleep you need. One of the most important things that factor into being organized is waking up on time each morning. Let’s face it, if you wake up late then it impacts the rest of your day. However, when you get adequate sleep then you’re more likely to get up on time each morning. Make sure you choose an appropriate bedtime for the children as well.\n\n\nFigure out how much sleep you need to feel well rested in the morning. Then figure out the exact time you need to be in bed in order to achieve this. You may need to experiment by sleeping a different amount of hours for a few nights to see which one works best for you.\nKeep in mind that most healthy adults need 7-9 hours of sleep and children need 10-14 hours of sleep based on age.[4]\n\nIt may be helpful to start winding down approximately 30 minutes before your bedtime. Try turning off electronics so that you can have some quiet time before bed. This is a great way to transition from the day’s activities to bed.",

Setting your alarm the night before will help you wake up on time in the morning.\n\n\nTo avoid hitting the snooze button in the morning and risk throwing yourself back off schedule, try putting your alarm clock in a place far from your bed. This way you will actually have to get up to turn it off.\nAlternatively, you could set two different alarm clocks that are far from your bed. Space out the timing by about 10 minutes. This way, even if you do lie back down after turning the first one off, the second one will still help you stay on track.\nMake sure the alarm is set to give you enough time to start the process of waking up the children in a timely manner. You may want to start waking slow-risers a few minutes in advance.",
                "Schedule your morning rituals. Many people have specific rituals that they like to engage in before starting the rest of their day. Your rituals could include prayer, exercise, meditation, journaling, or even just spending quiet time with loved ones in the morning. Whatever your rituals are, be sure to actually put them into your schedule. Intentionally scheduling in rituals helps you to avoid running late.\n\n\nSchedule in a specific block of time to participate in your rituals. Try half hour, one hour, or two hour blocks.\nMorning rituals often help you clear your mind and can increase productivity. Light exercise can increase blood flow and is a quick way to really increase productivity throughout the day. Something as simple as stretching can be a part of your exercise regimen.[5]",
                "Use a timer while doing hygiene. It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re in the shower, engaging in your beauty regimen, getting dressed, or doing other hygiene activities. However, investing in and using timer can help you stay on track. You can purchase one inexpensively at most stores.\n\n\nShowering while the kids are eating breakfast is something that some parents choose to do.[6] However, other parents prefer to eat breakfast with their children.\nShowering the night before is also an option to help stay organized in the morning.",
                "Find ways to use your time wisely. Multitasking is a great way to keep your family organized. For example, you can think of some ways that you can get chores done while also getting ready in the morning. Getting the kids on board to help is also useful. Here are a few suggestions:[7]\n\nThrow a load of laundry in the wash before leaving for work. You can put them in the dryer when you get home.\nIf you have a dog, you can have the children prepare the dog for his walk while you are in the shower. For instance, they can have his leash and “poop bags” ready in advance. When you’re finished showering, you can quickly walk the dog with the children.\nAllow older children to help get the younger children ready in the morning. Getting your ten year old to help find your preschooler’s shoes could really save you some time.",
                "Eat a healthy breakfast. Food is your body’s fuel therefore every morning routine should include a healthy breakfast.[8] If you have a tendency to skip breakfast, try to figure out why you avoid that meal. It may be that you are rushing in the morning or maybe you just don’t like breakfast foods. Whatever the reason, be sure to acknowledge it and then figure out a way to include breakfast into your routine.\n\n\nIf you don’t like breakfast foods, try eating lunch foods for breakfast instead.\nIf you find that you are rushing in the morning, go to bed a little earlier at night so that you can get up a little earlier in the morning.\nIf you’re not hungry in the morning, at least have a snack. Remember, food is fuel and it’s important that you properly fuel your body in the mornings.",
                "Leave the house on time. It’s important that you leave the house at the designated time to avoid rushing. Make sure that you factor in all of the stops that you have to make. Whether it’s dropping the children off at daycare or stopping for your morning coffee, be sure that there is plenty of time allotted to get to your destination.\n\n\nFigure out how much time you would need to get to your destination, including all stops in between. Try actually timing yourself one morning to get an accurate estimate. Then add 15 minutes to that timeframe to account for traffic or other unforeseen difficulties. Running late will throw you off schedule and you’ll certainly feel less organized.\nAlso, try packing needed material the night before. This can save time and help you get out of the door in a more timely fashion in the mornings.\nThe car ride to school is a great time to review test material, practice spelling words, or go over math facts, particularly if you had a busy night before.",
                "Pick out outfits for the next day. Choosing the outfits for the next day while your children are doing their nightly hygiene is a great time saver.[9] While they are in the bath you can take that time to choose their clothes so that you are not rushing the next day.\n\n\nIf your children are still very young, do NOT leave them unsupervised in the tub. Also, if your child is older, he can pick out his own clothes for the next day after hygiene is complete.\nBe sure that everything is picked out the night before. This includes shoes, socks, and any accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Also make sure the comb, pick, or hairbrush is in its place to avoid searching for them in the morning.\nAlternatively, you could pick out the clothes, including all accessories, for the entire week on Sunday evenings.\nMake sure coats, hats, and gloves are in the designated space for colder days.",
                "Get all bags ready. Have all bags ready and sitting in their designated space before going to bed.[10] This way, all you have to do is grab them as you are walking out the door. Bags that should be prepared include:\n\n\nBook bags\nWork bags\nLunch bags for the children, you, and your spouse can be filled with non-perishables the night before. The perishable foods and ice packs can be added in the morning.",
                "Organize breakfast in advance. Setting the breakfast table at night can result in a more organized morning. Set out place mats, cups, bowls, spoons and cereals the night before so that everyone can serve themselves as they get up.[11] All that is needed is the milk and juice in the mornings. This works well if you are a cereal eating family.\n\n\nYou may want to run a load of dishes in the dishwasher right after dinner. This way you will ensure clean dishes to set the table before heading to bed.",
                "Fill out forms. Waiting for the morning to fill out school forms can be disastrous. They can be time consuming, thrusted at you at the last minute, or may be forgotten altogether. Have a specific bin where all school forms go when the kids arrive home in the afternoon.[12] After the kids are in bed, fill out the forms and place them in backpacks so that they are ready to go in the morning.",
                "Create your daily to-do list. It is very helpful to have a to-do list ready the night before. This helps keep everything organized. Be sure to check your calendar and schedule before creating the list so that nothing is forgotten.\n\n\nIt may be helpful to hang a family calendar.[13] Everyone, with the exception of small children, is responsible for writing down dates of upcoming events. For example, Tierra would be responsible for noting on the calendar the date and time of her upcoming dance recital or basketball game.",
                "Practice a predictable daily schedule. Identify the times that your child engages in each activity and try to keep it the same each day. When children and parents know what is coming next, it makes the routine that much easier to follow. Specific activities that you may want to incorporate in your schedule include:\n\n\nBedtimes, wake times, and naps\nBathing\nLeaving for school or daycare\nExtracurricular activities\nMeals\nOther structured activities",
                "Organize your house. Children with ADHD often struggle with remembering where they have placed things. This can be quite challenging when you’re trying to stick to a schedule that is being disrupted because your child can’t remember where he placed his lunch bag. Make sure to organize your home so that he has a logical space to store his items. For example, he may keep his book bag in a bin next to the front door or pencils in his desk drawer. Organize your home so that it makes the most sense for your family and lifestyle.",
                "Create a homework plan. Allow your child to complete his homework in small chunks. In between each chunk, he should be permitted to have a break. It would probably be helpful to use a timer to help your child stay on task. Having a plan can help with the homework routine.\n\n\nHave a special place where your child does his homework and keeps his supplies. Keep in mind that every child is different. Some children may need a quiet place away from others to concentrate while other children may need to be near their parents for help with assignments.",
                "Make use of written instructions. Use written reminders to help your child stay focused on the routine. The instructions should be brief so that it doesn’t become a distraction.\n\n\nChecklists are great at keeping children with ADHD organized. Try posting a checklist by the exit door, in his room, or anywhere else that will help him to remember the routine.",
                "Offer lots of praise. When you see your child trying to stick to the daily routine, it’s very important to praise him. This will motivate him to continue to practice the routine to the best of his ability. Be sure to not just focus on him completing every detail but recognize his efforts as well."

        "wikiHow to Sex a Rat from Birth": {
            "intro": "If your female rat has just given birth to a litter, it can be heartwarming to see her with all of her little babies (‘kittens’). Although they’ll all be pink and hairless the first few days after they’re born,[1] it won’t be long before the kittens start to mature. It will be important for you to identify which kittens are male and which ones are female before they reach sexual maturity (around 5 weeks of age).[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Wait until the kittens are about two weeks old. Although it is possible to tell the difference between male and female kittens as soon as a few days after birth, handling them this soon after they are born can be very stressful to them. If there is no immediate urgency for you to determine the sex, wait for a few weeks before handling them.[3]\n\nAt two weeks of age, the kittens will open their eyes and can start eating solid food.[4]",
                "Look at the distance between the anus and urethra. When the kittens are about two weeks old, gently lift them out of the cage and place them on their backs in the palm of one of your hands. Identify the anus (under the tail) and urethra (small opening a little further up towards the belly).[5] The distance between these two body parts (‘anogenital distance’) will be 1.5 to 2 times longer in male rats than female rats.[6]\n\nThe male kittens’ testicles will eventually descend between the anus and urethra.[7]\n\nBe mindful that kittens typically do not like to stay still for long.[8] It may take a few tries before any of them stay still long enough for you to determine what sex they are.\nIn addition, the mother rat may not be comfortable with you handling her babies.[9] If the mother looks upset when you try to handle the kittens, try again later.\nHold two kittens in your hand at one time so you can compare the anogenital distances.",
                "Check for testicles near the tail. As male rats reach sexual maturity, they will develop a large, visible scrotum that contains the testicles.[10] However, the testicles can sometimes retract upward into a male rat’s abdomen, so you may not be able to see them.[11]\n\nThe scrotum and testicles should be visible on male kittens between three to four weeks of age.[12][13]\n\nSince the testicles can retract, they are not always a surefire way to differentiate between a male and female kitten.[14] If you do not see testicles, use the anogenital distance and presence/absence of nipples to make the sex determination.",
                "Separate the males from the females. When rats reach sexual maturity, they can become prolific breeders. One female rat can produce 6 to 12 litters per year, with each litter containing an average of 12 kittens—that’s a lot of rats! To prevent unwanted pregnancies, remove the male kittens from the cage when they are around three weeks old.[15]\n\nThe female kittens can stay with their mother until you adopt them out.[16]\n\nThe male kittens must be moved to a new cage because they will try to mate with their female littermates and mother.[17]",
                "Keep same-sex littermates together. Even after separating the sexes, you should house same-sex littermates in the same cage until they are six weeks old. This will help them continue their emotional development and help them get ready for being adopted.[18]\n\nAfter determining the sex of each kitten, handle them on a daily basis to get them more comfortable with humans.[19]\n\nAs the kittens get larger, pick them up by gently placing one hand behind their front legs. When you lift the kitten in the air, place your other hand around its back end for additional support.[20]",
                "Find homes for the kittens. When the kittens are old enough to be adopted out, you should start looking for someone to take them. It is not advisable to take them to a pet store, since they will likely become food for the snakes. Even taking the kittens to an animal shelter may not be the best idea, since the shelter may not have the facilities to care properly for the kittens and subsequently euthanize them.[21]\n\nYour best bet may be to put the word out in your local community that you have baby rats that are ready for adoption.\nWhen potential new owners contact you, ask them questions to make sure they are ready to make the commitment to give your baby rats the care and love they deserve. For example, ask them if they have ever owned rats before. If they have not, ask them if they have read up on how to care for rats.[22]\n\nTrust your gut when selecting someone to adopt your baby rats. You want them to go to a good home, so you should have a good feeling about the person who wants to adopt them.[23]\n\nMake sure you charge an adoption fee. It does not have to be a lot, but chances are the new ‘rat’ parent will care about the baby rats more if you do not give them to him or her for free.[24]",
                "Decide if you should spay or neuter your rat. Spaying a female rat involves taking out her ovaries and uterus. For males, neutering involves removing the testicles. Spaying, or desexing, is not a commonly-performed surgery in rats. Many rat owners decide to simply keep rats in groups of the same gender, rather than put their rats through surgery. However, if you plan to house your male and female rats together, you must have them spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted pregnancies.[25]\n\nA rat should be spayed or neutered at around three months of age.[26]\n\nSpaying a female rat comes with several benefits, including a decreased chance of developing several types of tumors (breast, uterine, pituitary), and the prevention of pyometra (bacterial infection of the uterus).[27]\n\nAn intact female will go into heat every few days and become quite grumpy and agitated. Spaying her can make her a little more pleasant to be around. [28]\n\nFor male rats, neutering decreases aggressive behavior and can make their coats less coarse.[29]\n\nDeciding to spay or neuter should be done on an individual basis, since all rats are different. If you are unsure what would be best for your male and female rats, discussing spaying and neutering with your veterinarian.",
                "Identify an experienced exotic veterinarian. Not all veterinarians have extensive experience with rats, particularly when it comes to performing surgery. If your own veterinarian is not an exotic expert, ask him or her to recommend other local exotic veterinarians. Having an exotic veterinarian who is experienced with performing rat surgeries increases the likelihood of your rat having a successful surgery.[30]\n\nOnce you have identified an exotic veterinarian, schedule an appointment with him or her. The veterinarian will examine your rat and make sure he or she is healthy enough for surgery.\nIf your rat has a treatable illness, the veterinarian will make sure the illness is fully treated before performing surgery.\nDiscuss the cost of a spay or neuter with the veterinarian. The exact cost will vary from one veterinary clinic to another.",
                "Take your rat to get spayed or neutered. If you have made the decision to spay or neuter your rat, and he or she is healthy enough for surgery, schedule the procedure with the exotic veterinarian. Fortunately, since rats cannot vomit, you do not have to fast your rat before surgery.[31]\n\nWhether your rat is getting spayed or neutered, the veterinarian will give your rat an antibiotic injection to prevent infection at the surgical site.[32] To control pain, the veterinarian may also give your rat some pre-surgical pain medication.[33]\n\nYour rat will be anesthetized for the surgery.[34]\n\nThe veterinarian will keep your rat warm during and after surgery to prevent your rat from developing hypothermia.[35] Since rats are small, they could lose body heat quickly during surgery.\nAt the end of surgery, the veterinarian will use suture that will dissolve on its own in a few weeks, meaning that you will not need to take your rat back to the veterinarian to have suture or staples taken out.[36]",
                "Observe your rat for signs of pain. A rat spay or neuter is an outpatient surgery, so you will be able to take your rat home the day of surgery. When you bring your rat home, you will need to keep a close eye on him or her to ensure a smooth recovery. For example, watch for signs of pain in your rat, including hunching over, not eating or drinking, and looking withdrawn.[37]\n\nDespite being a little woozy and lethargic after surgery, your rat should be able to resume normal activities.[38] However, pain could prevent your rat from doing so.\nIf the veterinarian did not already prescribe pain medication for your rat, contact him or her for a prescription. Administer the medication as prescribed.\nIn the first day or two after surgery, it may help to keep your rat separated from the other rats until he or she is up and moving around a little better.[39]",
                "Monitor your rat’s incision site. It is important for you to check for bleeding at your rat’s incision site. An easy way to do this is to put some white paper towel in his cage and check it periodically for spots of blood. If your rat has cage mates, you will need to keep a close watch on them to make sure they are not bothering the incision site and causing it to bleed.[40]\n\nThe cage bedding may also show spots of blood. Change the bedding frequently to reduce the chance of the incision site becoming infected from dirty bedding.\nYour rat may start to bother his incision site, which could cause it to bleed more and become susceptible to infection.[41] If the incision site is starting to look infected (e.g., swelling, yellow discharge), take your rat to your veterinarian for treatment."

In these states you may appear in court anytime before this date to be arraigned.",

On this day, you will not be presenting your case or your evidence to the judge, but will instead, be entering a plea of guilty, guilty with explanation, or not-guilty.[2]\n\nThose who enter a guilty with explanation plea, are admitting guilt but asking the court to consider the circumstances and conditions of their violation.\nThis can lead to reduced penalties.",

                "Serve the request. If you have already visited the court clerk, you will have all of the information needed to properly serve the prosecutor. When a prosecutor is served, he or she is legally acknowledging that they have indeed received your request. This establishes a legal date of receipt.[5]\n\nIf the prosecutor does not provide you with this; or does so beyond the legally allotted amount of time determined by your state, you can ask to have your case dismissed.",

If not, it can be grounds for dismissal.\nIf you were not the individual driving the car, then the photographs should support that claim and you can have your case dismissed.",
                "Bolster your claim by finding as much evidence as you can. Visit the scene and take detailed notes. Time the traffic light as it transitions from yellow-to-red. If the timing is minimal, you might be able to stage an argument in court that there is not enough time to safely bring your vehicle to a stop at the particular intersection.\n\n\nA copy of the photograph should be included with your \"request for production.\"",

                "Prepare all of your evidence. Arrange each piece of paperwork or evidence neatly in a folder and in the order that you wish to present it to the judge.\n\n\nIt might be helpful to have a checklist of points that you wish to make.",

The order in which the cases are heard will be determined by the court.\n\n\nBe prepared to spend an entire day at the courthouse.\nYou may want to pack a lunch or bring snacks.\nYou might have to pay for parking, so be prepared.",
                "Identify yourself to the court when your case is ready to be heard. The judge will then briefly review the details of your case before allowing the prosecutor to present the evidence against you.\n\n\nDo not interrupt.",

                "Take notes. Specifically, pay attention to any discrepancies between the prosecutor's verbal argument and the hard-evidence being presented.",
                "Ask for the case to be dismissed. If any of these conditions have not been met than you may have grounds to have your case dismissed by the judge.\n\n\nA \"request for production\" was not received, or was not received in the proper amount of time.[6]\n\nYour hearing has been delayed by the court beyond a responsible expectation to a \"fair and speedy trial.\" Your court clerk can will have more information regarding the number of days your state has determined as \"fair and speedy.\"[7]",
                "Describe the event in your own words. When it is your time to present your case, begin by providing a detailed account of the event from your own perspective. Include relevant information such as exact time, day, intersection, weather conditions, etc.\n\n\nPoint out any discrepancies between your account and the prosecutor's.\nDoes the prosecutor's account match the hard evidence?",
                "Assert your claim. After you have described the conditions of the event, and after you have addressed any discrepancies, you should go ahead and re-assert to the judge why it is you wish to have your case dismissed.\n\n\nWere there any extenuating circumstances that you believe should be considered?\nIs the timing of the light flawed?\nWas it unsafe to stop?",
                "After you have made your case, present your evidence to the judge. Only provide evidence that fully-supports your claim, or that directly challenges the case as it was presented by the prosecutor.\n\n\nAfter you have presented your evidence, the judge will then move on to the closing statements.\nThe prosecutor will go first.",
                "Listen to the prosecuting attorney's closing argument. You do not necessarily need to respond to his or her closing statements as you have already made your case.",
                "Provide your own closing statement. Reiterate and summarize your argument or the reason you are seeking dismissal. Be as clear and concise as possible. Speak as if answering the question, \"why should your case be dismissed?\"\n\n\nBe factual, not emotional.",
                "Wait for the verdict. If all went well, then you may have just successfully defended yourself against a red-light camera violation."

        "wikiHow to Sleep While Pregnant": {
            "intro": "Sleeping while pregnant can be difficult. Having a baby bump can make it hard to get into a cozy position. Also, nausea, heartburn, and frequent urination can keep you up at night. If you're having trouble sleeping during pregnancy, there are steps you can take to improve the quality of your sleep. You should work on finding a good sleep position each night. You should also form a sleep routine to signal to your mind and body when it's time to rest. Lastly, make certain lifestyle changes, like exercising regularly and eating right, that promote solid sleep.",
            "steps": [
                "Sleep in the position that is most comfortable for you. Sleeping on your left side during pregnancy can help to promote blood flow to your baby, and some women find it more comfortable than sleeping on your back.[1] However, you can sleep in any position that you find most comfortable, whether it is on your left side, right side, or on your back.\n\n\nFor added comfort, try to bend one or both of your knees.[2]\n\nIf you suddenly feel light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, or unwell, then this is a sign you need to change positions and turn to your left side. These symptoms should resolve shortly after changing to the left side position.",
                "Use pillows for support. You can use a pillow for support in a variety of ways. Use a firm, strong pillow that can support a lot of weight.\n\n\nTry placing a pillow between your knees or tucking it under your abdomen. You may also want to keep a pillow behind your back. This can increase comfort when sleeping.[3]\n\nConsider purchasing a specialty pregnancy pillow. These are pillows specifically designed to support the bodies of pregnant women. A pregnancy pillow may work better for your needs than a regular pillows.[4]",
                "Elevate your head. Heartburn is a frequent problem for pregnant women. You can lessen the symptoms of heartburn by elevating your head during sleep. Simply prop up your head on a pillow before nodding off.[5]",
                "Get on a sleep schedule. A solid sleep schedule is good for anyone's sleep hygiene, and may help improve rest when you're pregnant. You will fall asleep and wake up easier if you get yourself on a sleep schedule. This means going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time each day, even weekends. When your body is on a regular sleep/wake cycle, you'll get tired at night and then energetic in the morning.[6]",
                "Avoid heavy meals before bed. Indigestion and nausea are common problems during pregnancy. You can exasperate these issues if you eat a heavy meal before bed. Try to stick to light snacks in the hours leading up to bedtime and don’t eat within two to three hours of going to bed.[7]\n\nIt may help to schedule your big meals around lunch and dinner. Eating a big breakfast and a heavy lunch can stave off feelings of hunger at night.\nIf you're feeling hungry or nauseous before bed, try having a few plain crackers. This can fill up your stomach and may prevent nighttime nausea.\nIt is important to avoid eating within two to three hours of going to sleep because this can increase your chances of developing heartburn.",
                "Limit liquid intake close to bedtime. When you're pregnant, you will urinate more due to the baby pressing down on your bladder. It's a good idea to cut back on liquids in the hours leading up to bedtime. Fluid intake throughout the day is important, so do not neglect water during daytime hours. Simply cut back on fluids close to bedtime.[8]\n\nCaffeinated beverages, like teas and coffees, are a particularly big culprit in keeping you awake at night. As you should limit your caffeine intake when pregnant, it may be a good idea to cut out caffeinated beverages altogether during your pregnancy.",
                "Practice relaxation techniques. If you're having trouble sleeping, try relaxation exercises. They can get your mind off of the stress of your pregnancy, as well as any bothersome physical symptoms.[9]\n\nYou can try a breathing exercise. Breathe in and out in slow, steady breaths. Focus on the air going in and out of your lungs. If there is any tension in your body, release that tension as you breathe. If your mind starts to wander, bring it back to the breath.\nTry guided imagery. Imagine a relaxing scenario, like a childhood home or an ideal vacation. Take a mental vacation to that place and try to let go of other thoughts. Imagine all aspects of your imagined getaway, including sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste.",
                "Make sure you have a solid sleep environment. Where you're sleeping can have an impact on the quality of your sleep. If you're struggling to sleep while pregnant, evaluate your room and make any necessary changes.[10]\n\nTry dimming the lights in your room before bed. This will alert your body that it's time to sleep.\nMake sure your room environment is relaxing. A room should be calm and peaceful. If your room is cluttered, this can make sleep difficult.\nReduce any bothersome noise. If you live in a noisy neighborhood, use a fan or a noise machine to block out unwanted sounds. Keep your windows closed at night to reduce outside sound.\nRemove any blue light sources from your bedroom as well, such as TVs, computer screens, tablets, digital alarm clocks, and cell phones.",
                "Exercise. Exercising every day can help to regulate sleep during pregnancy as well. Get some physical exercise in every day. Try to get your exercise in the morning or early afternoon because exercising too close to bedtime can make it hard to fall asleep. If you want to do something physical in the evening, do something relaxing like yoga. This may have a positive impact on your sleep.[11]\n\nTry taking a 30 minute walk when you wake up in the morning or after eating lunch.\nExercise is safe for most pregnant women. However, talk to your doctor first if you have any health issues, or have had difficult pregnancies in the past. You want to make sure exercise is safe for you and your baby.",
                "Eat a healthy diet. As nausea and heartburn are a major culprit in sleepless nights when pregnant, work on regulating your diet. If you feed your body healthy foods rich in vitamins and nutrients, this may lessen symptoms of nausea associated with pregnancy.[12]\n\nAvoid acidic and spicy foods, as these can make heartburn worse.\nEat a balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables. Strive for lean proteins and complex carbs like whole grain bread, rice, and pasta.",
                "Have bland snacks throughout the day. Make sure to snack throughout the day, but go for bland foods like plain crackers. Such foods can help lessen nausea, which often keeps pregnant women awake during the night.[13]\n\nWatch your calories, however. It's healthy to gain weight during pregnancy, but only up to a certain amount. Many types of crackers and bland snacks contain a lot of empty calories, so keep an eye on portion size to avoid overeating.",
                "Take daytime naps on occasion. Naps are usually not advised as they can make it difficult to sleep at night. However, if you're pregnant, naps can actually be helpful. Even when taking the proper steps to better your sleep, some nights will still be difficult during pregnancy. It's important for your health to get enough sleep. Take daytime naps on occasion if you're feeling particularly drowsy.[14]"

This fear can emerge even during one-on-one conversations. Communication apprehension can range from being nervous about speaking in front of others to having a full-blown panic attack.

Construct an anxiety hierarchy to help you better understand your fears.[2]\n\nConstructing an anxiety hierarchy starts with a list of situations where the anxiety is felt. After the list is complete, you then rank them from the lowest level of anxiety all the way to the one situation with the highest level of stress.\nThe final list would normally contain between 10 and 20 items that begin with something that brings on so little anxiety is almost does not bother you to the one situation that gives you the most anxiety.\nFor example, an anxiety hierarchy for talking to your boss might look like this:\n\nSaying hi to the boss in the hall\nTalking to the boss in her office in a neutral situation\nAnswering a direct question from the boss when put on the spot\nTalking to the boss about a negative situation",
                "Identify small ways you can face your fear. While you may hear from some people the best thing to do is to ignore the fear, it is actually better to break down what is actually making you fearful and take small steps to work through that.[3]\n\nIf you are fearful of being in front of an audience, take a small step like making an effort to speak up at a meeting in front of a small group of other employees. Work your way up to slightly larger groups.\nIf the fear is more related to speaking in front of strangers, a first small step could be as simple as making a call to a wrong number on purpose simply to force yourself to talk to a stranger. Build from there by starting a conversation with a stranger waiting in line at a coffee shop.",
                "Imagine yourself in a distressing situation. If you fear speaking up in class, go through the motions of envisioning yourself doing this. Practice how you would handle the situation and prepare as much as you can on the subject so you are ready to speak up without fear of the subject.[4]\n\nPractice and role play the situation that is intimidating. Become very familiar with whatever subject you are talking about so it becomes easier and almost second nature to talk about the subject. This will help with your fear of forgetting the topic.\nMaking sure you feel confident in the subject will also allow you to focus on the topic instead of the audience. You do not want to totally ignore the audience since you need to be aware of their reactions, but focusing on your mastery of the topic will take some of the focus off the audience.",
                "Use relaxation techniques as needed. This would include a combination of deep breathing, visual imagery and other methods discussed in this article. As you are imagining your fears, you are likely to experience anxiety. Use the techniques you have learned to return to a state of calm. Over time, the anxiety-provoking situation won’t affect you as much.[5]",
                "Do a trial run by attempting one of your fears. Avoid waiting to speak in front of a group until it is critical to your job or school life. Give yourself time to succeed and testing grounds to make mistakes without the worry of messing up the “big speech”.[6]\n\nLearn to work with your fear instead of trying to hide it. When you try to hide the fear you may find yourself overcome by internal negative self speak that is almost always far worse than what the audience is actually thinking. You do not need to like public speaking to be good at it and to do it successfully.",
                "Know that you are not alone. It is estimated that up to 74% of Americans have some level of speaking anxiety. While that large of a number experiences the fear in differing levels, many of them report that they are more fearful of public speaking than death.[7] CA may start early in life as it is very prevalent in elementary school-aged children.\n\n\nCommunication apprehension may come about as a result of genetics, as a personality trait, or even only in certain circumstances.[8]",
                "Ask yourself what’s the worst that could happen. You may be making a bigger problem out of the “worst case” than it really is. Consider what’s the very worse that you expect to happen. If you have been exaggerating the power of your fear, you may start to notice that the potential repercussions that you have been worried about aren’t all that bad.[9]\n\nRegardless of how one interaction goes, for the most part it is not going to make or break anything major. You will probably not lose your job nor will one error ruin your life or health. If you fear speaking in front of strangers, in all reality there is a good chance they will not remember what happens for very long. You may also never see your audience again.",
                "Envision success, not failure. Redefine what success means to you and acknowledge that using your voice, even with a bump or two in the road, is a win over the fear.[10]\n\nRemember that the majority of the people listening to you at any given time also report some level of speaking anxiety. You taking the step to make the speech or communicate with others in any way is brave.",
                "Challenge your negative thoughts. There is a good chance what you are thinking is far worse than what the audience is thinking. Self-talk like “I’m an idiot” or “I’m going to make a fool of myself” will only make matters worse. Strive to attack these negative thoughts and think thoughts that are realistic and positive. You can challenge your negative thinking with questions like:[11]\n\nWhat would a friend say about my thoughts?\nWhat evidence do I have that this is true? What evidence do I have that this is not true?\nHow many times has this terrible thing actually happened?\nIs my thinking based on how I feel rather than on facts?",
                "Breathe deeply when you feel anxious. When you have anxiety you may breathe too shallow, focus too much on your breathing or attempt to take on too big of breathes to get oxygen you feel that is missing.[12]\n\nIf you are feeling like you are going to hyperventilate, try Co2 Rebreathing. While you may think you are having troubles getting enough oxygen, in reality hyperventilating occurs when your Co2 level is low. Cup your hand over your mouth as you breathe normally. Re-breathe the same air in the hand to return the Co2 back into the body.\nDeep breathing can be good to self-calm. The easiest exercise starts simply by sitting in a chair with arm rests so you can sit up straight with arms to your side. Take a deep breath in through your nose to the count of 5. Then, slowly over a count of 7 release through your mouth. Repeat for 10 total sets of in and out breathes.",
                "Learn progressive muscle relaxation. This exercise is quite simple. You basically sit comfortably in a chair or on a couch, and gradually contract and relax each muscle group in your body. Begin at your toes. Tense your muscles and hold for several seconds, noticing what the tension feels like. Then, relax your toes and take in that feeling of released tension. Next, move up to another set of muscles.\n\n\nYou may prefer to find a more formal exercise to follow.[13] Or, you can do the exercise with music.[14]",
                "Try out guided imagery. You can do self-guided imagery by recording yourself reading a sample scenario or you may find a recording that works for you for the exercise.[15]\n\nOne example of a self-guide imagery you can record to listen to would be focusing on describing your own special place with all of your senses. You would describe this special place in enough detail that just listening to the recording will trigger a visual image. Describe the sensations you feel around this special place and why it makes you feel good.\nIf coming up with your own script is not easy for you to do, you can download a script to record.[16]",
                "Recite a calming mantra. This process would first include choosing a simple yet meaningful mantra and then following relaxing techniques as you focus and recite this mantra.[17]\n\nOnce you have a mantra that seems like a good fit, find an object you can focus on while reciting the mantra. Do the exercise in a safe space without distractions where you are free to focus on your posture, being tall and strong. You will also focus on deep, relaxed breathing as you repeat your mantra.",
                "See a specialist. Someone with experience treating communication apprehension and other forms of social anxiety can help you overcome your fears. Keep in mind that this should not be a last-ditch effort. You may want to see a therapist or counselor to discuss your anxiety, but also work on many of the self-help strategies listed in this article.\n\n\nA specialist can help diagnose the level of anxiety you experience during communication with special tests.[18] Be sure that you are straightforward with your provider so that he or she can adequately assess your problem."

        "wikiHow to Remove Silicone Caulk from Hands": {
            "intro": "Silicone caulk can be a great tool for home improvement projects like filling cracks in the exterior of a house or waterproofing a shed in your backyard. Its stickiness and gap-filling properties make it an excellent watertight sealant. Unfortunately, these same properties can make it a serious pain to get off of your hands when you're done working. Because the quickest, easiest way to spread caulk is often with your fingers, this can become a frequent nuisance during large-scale projects. To learn how to get this sticky substance off of your hands with a minimum of time and effort, get started with Step 1 below!",
            "steps": [
                "Remove as much of the caulk as you can before it dries. Silicone caulk can be seriously sticky stuff, so the more you can get off of your hands initially, the easier it will be to get your hands completely clean in the long run. As soon as you notice caulk on your hands, take a tissue or paper towel and immediately wipe it away. Discard the tissue or paper towel immediately afterward to avoid accidentally spreading the caulk.\n\n\nDon't use a fabric towel (especially one that you care about). Once silicone dries, it's very difficult to get out. In addition, it's basically waterproof, so even if it doesn't ruin your towel's appearance, it may make it less useful as a towel.",
                "Rub your hands with a plastic bag. Once you wipe the excess caulk off of your hands, grab a cheap plastic bag (like the kind you get at the grocery store). Rub your hands with the bag, using it the same way you'd use a washcloth. If the silicone hasn't already dried, it should cling to the bag more readily than it clings to your hands, removing much of the remaining caulk. Though this trick is a little unconventional, it's cited by certain home improvement resources as being effective.[1]\n\nIf you don't have a grocery bag handy, most cheap plastic bags (like, for instance, trash can liners) should work well.",
                "Rinse with water. If the caulk on your hands hasn't had a chance to dry, you should be able to remove much of it with a paper towel or plastic bag. To get the last of it, rinse with water. As you rinse, periodically scrub your hands with a sponge, paper towel, or mild abrasive. As noted above, you'll probably want to avoid using \"nice\" towels to remove caulk.\n\n\nYou may use soap if you wish. However, it's unclear whether doing this has any significant effect.",
                "Dry your hands and repeat if needed. Next, dry your hands off with a rag or paper towel. Examine them carefully, checking for any remaining caulk. Be thorough — even a small amount can be annoying once it dries. If you see any silicone remaining, you will probably want to repeat the steps above as needed until it's been removed or it's become obvious that it won't leave your hands.",
                "Act fast! When used for its intended purpose, silicone caulk can take some time to dry completely — roughly 24 hours for a standard \"bead\". However, when it's spread thin or in tiny drops on your hands, it can dry much faster. Because of this, time is of the essence when you're trying to get silicone caulk off of your hands. The quicker you start removing wet caulk from your hands, the less effort you'll have to spend trying to remove dry caulk, which is much harder to clean off.\n\n\nBecause a big part of keeping your hands clean when caulking is to be able to clean them right away, it can be very helpful to keep cleaning supplies with you as you do your caulking. Keeping a clean plastic bag and a few paper towels near you while you work can make the difference between completely clean hands at the end of your project and the lingering inconvenience of hands caked with dry silicone.",
                "Try using a home remedy if dry caulk remains. If you've tried the tips above and haven't been able to get the caulk off of your hands, there's a good chance that it's had time to dry. Unfortunately, because dry caulk is a strong adhesive and is basically waterproof, paper towels, plastic bags, and water won't be much help removing it. In this case, you may want to try one of the many home remedies recommended for removing dried caulk from your hands in the section below. Though these methods aren't definitively proven, many online sources recommend them.",
                "Try acetone. One of the most common pieces of advice you may find online when trying to remove dried silicone from your hands is to use acetone. Acetone, an organic chemical frequently used in nail polish removers, is able to dissolve some plastics (like, for instance, acrylic nail polish) with ease. Its ability to dissolve or weaken silicone caulk is less definite. However, many online sources attest to its usefulness.[2]\n\nTo use this method, soak the corner of a paper towel with pure acetone or a nail polish remover containing acetone and gently wet the spots on your hands covered with acetone. Don't pour the acetone all over your hands — this is wasteful and can produce noxious unpleasant fumes. If using nail polish remover, check the ingredient label to be sure it contains acetone before using.",
                "Try (cautiously) using a hair dryer. Silicone, like many other synthetic compounds, will eventually weaken if heated up gradually. Because of this property, some sources recommend using a hair dryer to loosen the caulk's hold on your hands. Turn the dryer on and wave it over the affected areas, allowing the silicone to gradually warm. Once you feel that the silicone has heated up, try scrubbing with a sponge or another mild abrasive to get it off.\n\n\nIf you want to try this method, be sure to start with the lowest possible setting on the hair dryer. Gradually increase the heat as needed and stop immediately if the heat becomes intense or painful. Silicone isn't worth burning yourself over — it will eventually fall off on its own.",
                "Try an abrasive. Another way to get silicone off of your hands is simply to rub (and rub, and rub...) until there's none left. However, this method requires a warning. Silicone is quite tough — in fact, for most purposes, it's tougher than your skin. Because of this, you'll want to be very careful as you use your abrasive to remove the silicone to avoid rubbing your skin raw. Use only mild abrasives, not harsh ones like steel wool. Stop rubbing well before you think you might be sore. Remember, the silicone will eventually fall off on its own, so there's no reason to hurt yourself trying to get it off. Just a few appropriate abrasives you might consider using are:\n\n\nKitchen sponges\nFine-grit sandpaper (if you're careful)\nPumice stones",
                "Try mineral spirits. Like acetone, mineral spirits (a turpentine substitute sometimes called \"white spirits\" in the UK) are sometimes prescribed for the task of weakening stubborn silicone caulk. As with acetone, the actual usefulness of mineral spirits is the subject of some doubt, though some home improvement sites recommend them.[3] If you have some mineral spirits handy, try applying some to dried-on silicone lightly with a soaked paper towel. Follow with abrasion once the spirits have had a chance to weaken the silicone. If you don't have mineral spirits, you can usually find some at major hardware stores for fairly cheap (usually not much more than $10 per gallon).\n\n\nWhile mineral spirits are usually not dangerous to touch, be sure to thoroughly wash yourself after coming into contact with them. Being in direct contact with mineral spirits for several hours or longer can lead to seriously nasty chemical burns.",
                "When all else fails, simply wait. Sometimes, particularly stubborn spots of silicone caulk can stick to your hands despite your repeated efforts to get it off. In these cases, your best option may be simply to wait for it to fall off on its own, rather than wear your hands red trying to get it off. Your body naturally sheds dead skin cells nearly constantly. Once the skin under the dried-on silicone dies, it will eventually fall off, taking the caulk with it.\n\n\nThe human body usually takes about 27 days to completely shed and replenish an entire layer of skin.[4] The silicon gel dried to your hands will probably take less time to fall off (on the order of a week or so).",
                "Don't use harsh solvents. When it comes to getting silicone caulk off of your hands, stick to the safe methods described in this article — don't risk trying anything that may hurt you. For instance, while acetone and mineral spirits are generally safe for brief use on your hands, other, harsher chemicals can present serious problems. Many noxious or caustic solvents can be harmful if touched, inhaled, or ingested, so you'll want to stay far away from them. Below are just a few of the sorts of chemicals you definitely won't want to use to get caulk off of your hands:\n\n\nBleach\nDrain cleaner\nPaint thinner\nLye\nStrong acids or bases.",
                "Don't scrape or gouge the caulk. Never use a sharp tool or a harsh abrasive to physically remove silicone caulk from your hands. Though it may be tempting to use a knife or a handful of steel wool to scrape or cut annoying dried-on caulk away from your hands, these methods run a high risk of injuring your hands. On top of this, there's very little guarantee that they work well against the gummy, clingy texture of silicone. Though this advice probably goes without saying for most, in the interests of safety, it bears mentioning."

        "wikiHow to Set Up a Turtle Tank": {
            "intro": "Caring for a turtle can be a very rewarding and relaxing experience, but you also need to take the responsibility seriously by setting up an appropriate tank for your new aquatic or semi-aquatic friend. A good turtle tank will have both water and land areas, and the conditions of the tank will be maintained by proper lighting and filtering.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a large, sturdy glass tank.[1] Your turtle will need a glass fish tank that can provide roughly 10 to 15 gallons (38 to 57 L) (38 to 57 L) of water for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of turtle.\n\n\nIf you do not have a mature turtle, base your measurements off the average size your turtle's species reaches upon maturity.\nDo not use a reptile tank designed for terrestrial (land-living) reptiles. The glass is too thin and can break due to the pressure of the water. The glass used for turtle tanks should be at least 0.4 inches (10 mm) thick.\nIf you have more than one turtle, size the tank according to your first turtle and add half that size to your original measurement for each additional turtle. This should give you your final tank size.\nKeep in mind that the tank should be deeper than it is wide. Otherwise, your turtle may not have enough room to flip itself upright if it accidentally turns upside-down.\nFor most turtles, the length of the tank should be three or four times the length of the turtle and the width should be twice the length of the turtle. The height of the tank should be one and a half to two times the length of the turtle, but you should also make sure that there is a full 1 foot (30.5 cm) above the highest point the turtle can reach when placed inside the tank to prevent the turtle from climbing out.",
                "Provide a lamp. You can use a lamp that hooks onto the turtle tank, or you could opt for one that stands separately but can be directed down onto the tank.\n\n\nThe light itself needs to shine on the portion of the tank you intend to set aside as a basking area.\nSemi-aquatic turtles need full spectrum light, so you should use a lamp with both UVA and UVB bulbs. UVB light stimulates the production of vitamin D3 and maintains the natural environment, while UVA light encourage more activity and a heartier appetite. UVB bulbs should provide the main lighting.\nYou should also consider running the light on a timer to simulate natural light cycles. Most turtles need a natural light cycle of 12 to 14 hours, followed by 10 to 12 hours of darkness.\nOn a related note, you'll also need to keep the tank in a good location. You can place the tank near indirect sunlight or in shade, but do not place it in direct sunlight. Bright, full sun could end up baking and killing the turtle.",
                "Consider using a water heater.[2] Use a fully submersible water heater to help maintain a consistent temperature year-round. These heaters attach to the side of the aquarium with suction cups.\n\n\nYou may need to hide the heater behind a wall to prevent the turtle from breaking it as it swims around.\nBefore installing a water heater, make sure that your turtle needs one. The preferred temperature will depend on the turtle species. A species that prefers room temperature water usually doesn't need a water heater, but those that prefer warmer temperatures might.",
                "Invest in a good filter. Filters are vital to the health of your tank, but choosing the right kind can be difficult. Turtles produce more waste than fish, though, and without a filter, you would need to change the water daily.\n\n\nLarge canister filters work best.[3] They can be expensive, but the size ensures that filter will not get clogged up easily. As a result, the tank will stay more sanitary and the turtle will remain healthier. A canister filter also minimizes the amount of cleaning you have to do. Lastly, even though the initial cost of a canister filter is higher than it is with other filter types, the long-term costs associated with water and filter changes will actually be lower.\nIf you use an internal filter instead of a canister filter, use the largest you can find and opt for two filters instead of one.\nEven with a good filter, you will need to change the water at least once every two weeks.",
                "Look at tank covers. Select a heat-proof metal screen cover for the top of your tank. While not strictly essential, covers will protect your turtle from potential threats like broken lamp bulbs.\n\n\nSince lamp bulbs used for turtle habitats tend to get very hot, they can easily explode if they get splashed with water, making this a very real threat.\nYou may also want to clamp the cover onto the top of your tank to prevent larger turtles from climbing out.\nDo not use glass or plexiglass tank covers since these materials filter out the UVB rays a turtle needs for survival. Moreover, these materials are more likely to shatter or melt.",
                "Get the tools you'll need to monitor conditions. Conditions can change slightly over time when left alone, so you will need to monitor and maintain the right conditions regularly to keep your turtle healthy.\n\n\nUse thermometers to monitor the temperature of the water and the temperature of the basking/land area. Most turtles prefer water temperatures around 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). Land temperatures should be between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (27 and 29 degrees Celsius).[4]\n\nYou should also keep an eye on the humidity in your tank, so you'll need a hygrometer to do this. The right humidity level will depend on the turtle species, and you can change humidity inside the tank by adding or removing substrate from the land/basking area.",
                "Spread substrate on the bottom of the tank only if needed. Generally, you don't need to cover the bottom of the tank with any substrate. The only time this is a necessity is if you decide to place live plants in the tank.\n\n\nSubstrate can actually make the tank more difficult to clean.\nIf you're going to use substrate, the best choices are fine sand, gravel, and fluorite.\n\nSand is difficult to clean, but some turtles do enjoy digging in it.\nGravel can create a nice appearance, but you need to make sure that the gravel pieces are more than 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) in diameter; otherwise, the turtle may try eating the gravel.\nFluorite is a porous clay gravel that provides plenty of nutrients for plants. Turtles generally don't eat it, but you should still opt for larger fluorite just to be safe.",
                "Create a land area. Aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles both need a land area inside the tank. Most semi-aquatic turtles need a land area that takes up at least 50 percent of the space in the tank. Most aquatic turtles should have a land mass that takes up no more than 25 percent of the space in the tank.\n\n\nTurtles use this land area to bask and dry themselves.\nThe diameter of the land mass should also be at least one and a half times as long as the length of the turtle.\nThere are plenty of different options to consider. You can buy a special turtle dock from a pet supply store, or you could use a rock or log. Floating docks are often preferable since they adjust to the water level and do not take up valuable room inside the tank.\nAvoid using rocks and logs from nature since they can pose a health threat to your turtle. If you do use something from nature, boil it in a separate pot of water to kill any algae, germs, or dangerous microorganisms.\nIf you want to use something for a land mass that does not have a weight to anchor it, glue the land in place along the side of the tank with silicone aquarium sealant.",
                "Provide a water-to-land ramp, if necessary. Turtles need a way to climb onto the land area. Ideally, the land area itself should gently slope down into the water. If it doesn't, you will need to install a separate ramp.\n\n\nThe ramp itself can be fairly simple. For instance, a curves or sloping log can be attached to the land area from one side, with the other side dipping down gently into the water. A piece of thick plastic can also be used in a similar way.",
                "Choose the right decorations. Turtles do not need many decorations to survive, but adding a few can make the tank nicer to look at and may also help your turtle feel a little more secure.\n\n\nAdd logs, smooth rocks, and terrestrial (land) plants to provide hiding places on the basking area. You could also use a wooden enclosure. Just make sure that the turtle still has plenty of room to spread out on the empty portion of the basking area.\nReal plants work great, but note that turtles will nibble on them, so you should only choose aquatic and terrestrial plants that are non-toxic to turtles.\nDecorations with sharp edges pose a threat to your turtle and should be avoided.\nStore bought decorations do not need to be sterilized, but decorations picked up from nature need to be boiled separately to kill off harmful germs.\nNever use a decoration with a diameter less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) since the turtle may try to eat it.\nAvoid enclosure-style decorations since your turtle may get stuck while swimming under it.",
                "Place decorations and equipment carefully. All foreign objects in the tank should be placed along the edges so that the turtle can swim freely. You can also place equipment beneath the land area to hide it.\n\n\nIf you want to place something in the center of the tank, opt for clumps of plants since these will not interfere with the turtle's ability to swim. Place tall or stiff decorations only in the edges.\nMake sure that you do not create any enclosures or tight spots that your turtle could get stuck in as you place equipment and decorations in the tank.",
                "Fill the tank with clean water. Fill the tank with enough water for the turtle to swim comfortably. Most turtles need at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.25 cm) of water.\n\n\nYou need to make sure that the water depth is at least three-quarters the length of the turtle. This depth allows the turtle to flip itself upright if it accidentally turns upside-down in the water.\nThe vast majority of pet turtles are freshwater creatures, so you should provide clean water from your sink or from jugs of distilled water."

        "wikiHow to Avoid Getting Food in Your Braces": {
            "intro": "When you are out all day at school and work, you don’t want to worry about how much food will be stuck in your braces by the time you get home. There are simple, quick ways to get food out of your braces, or to avoid getting food in them altogether. There are a few steps you can take to keep your braces food-free all day long.",
            "steps": [
                "Maintain a balanced diet. One of the best ways to keep food out of your braces is to eat a balanced, healthy diet because this automatically eliminates a lot of problematic foods (like sticky candy).[1]\n\nA balanced diet also means less sugar. Sugar causes plaque to form around braces, which can grab food while you eat.",
                "Cut food into smaller pieces. A key to eating what you want without getting food stuck in your braces is to cut it up. Don’t bite into carrots or apples or corn on the cob (which can damage your braces anyway), but instead cut corn off the cob or cut uncooked produce into bite-size pieces.\n\n\nPlace these smaller pieces at the back of your mouth so that you can chew with your back teeth.[2]\n\nAvoid tearing food apart with your front teeth, where any particles can easily get stuck.",
                "Eat slowly. Eating slowly and carefully will not only alert you more quickly to food particles that snag on braces, but it will also prevent food from accumulating on your braces in the first place. Eating slowly allows you to get a feel for how the food is interacting with your braces.[3]",
                "Brush after meals. For the best oral hygiene, brush your teeth four times a day, once after each meal and once right before bed. Such frequent brushing is bound to get food particles out of your braces, especially the pieces that didn’t come off using other techniques like a toothpick.[4]\n\nCarry a travel-sized toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse or pockets in order to keep up good oral hygiene while you’re out.\nIf you let plaque remain on your teeth by not brushing, it can leave stains on your teeth and cause inflamed gums, which may lead to spontaneous bleeding.[5]\n\nYour dentist may also tell you to use a fluoride mouthwash to further break down plaque.[6]",
                "Carry a pocket mirror. If you’re going out to eat with other people, you’ll want to have a way to check your braces discreetly. It’s nice to have your own mirror in case you feel a piece of food, or someone points out something in your braces, so that you don’t have to leave in search of a mirror.\n\n\nIt’s also good to check your braces in the pocket mirror quickly before engaging in conversation after the meal.",
                "Check your braces for food. You can do a braces check for embarrassing food particles with a pocket mirror, your tongue, or your finger. All of these can be done discreetly and quickly to minimize social awkwardness.\n\n\nPull out your pocket mirror and glance down at it without drawing attention to yourself.\nRun your tongue over your braces to feel for large food particles while someone else is talking.\nPull a napkin over your mouth and run one finger over the most visible parts of your braces to check for large food pieces.",
                "Keep a napkin handy. Every time you go out to eat, snatch a napkin and keep it on your lap. You can use it as a shield for discreetly checking your braces during the meal.\n\n\nHold the napkin up as a visual barrier with one hand and get food out with the other hand.",
                "Swish water in your mouth. Water can act as a rinse for your braces. Always order a glass of water with your meal. Then simply pull a gulp of water into your mouth and quickly swish it around while you eat.\n\n\nDo this while someone else is talking so that the focus is not on you.\nSwishing water around like this repeatedly throughout a meal will go a long way toward keeping food from sticking to your braces.\nSome dentists recommend rinsing with warm water throughout the day.[7]",
                "Carry toothpicks. Toothpicks are an easy remedy for large, obvious food particles when you’re out with friends. Keeping a stash of toothpicks in a sealed bag on your person will help you quickly dig out stubborn pieces of food that you find during or after a meal.\n\n\n\nOnly use toothpicks to get food out from behind wires and do not apply too much force or you risk detaching the bracket. Be careful to avoid using the toothpick between teeth to remove food. This can damage your teeth.[8]\n\nYou can use a toothpick to clear blocked braces while sitting at the table by using a napkin as a shield.\nOtherwise, go to the bathroom and use the mirror there to locate and eradicate food particles with a toothpick.",
                "Purchase an interdental toothbrush. Also called a proxabrush, this little brush is shaped like a tiny pipe cleaner and is much more effective than toothpicks. It fits easily into a purse or pocket. This more specialized tool can help you get more out of your braces than your finger as well.[9]\n\nUse it to clear food particles out from behind wires.\nYou can find interdental toothbrushes at most big box stores.",
                "Pick soft foods. Soft foods help prevent damage to your braces, but they don’t get much food stuck in your braces, either. Saying no to hard foods like hard candy and whole apples will prevent a difficult cleaning session later in the day. Choose foods like these:[10]\n\nDairy —Yogurt, soft cheeses\nBread —Slices of soft bread, pancakes, soft tortillas\nGrains —Pasta, rice\nMeat —Cooked meats, lunch meat\nSeafood —Most dinner fish like salmon and tilapia\nCooked vegetables\nMashable fruits —Bananas, applesauce\nSoups",
                "Avoid hard foods. Some hard foods are healthy, but that doesn’t mean you should eat them, at least not if you are looking to keep food out of your braces. Even apples and carrots should not be eaten whole when you want to keep food out of your braces. Unhealthy hard foods — like hard candy — should always be on your “no eat” list. Stay away from foods like these:\n\n\nNuts\nHard candy\nChips\nWhole apples\nRaw carrots\nHard crusty bread\nIce\nBagels",
                "Eat less sugar. Sugar gets stuck in your braces, even though it’s invisible. When it does, it causes tooth decay from plaque build-up around the braces, and the potential for further damage like staining.[11] To help keep sugar from getting trapped in your braces, avoid sugary foods like these:\n\n\nCandy\nChocolate\nBaked goods\nSweetened yogurt\nSugary syrups",
                "Say no to sticky food. One of the worst culprits for getting food stuck in your braces is sticky food. Not only does sticky food gravitate toward your braces, getting lodged behind the wires, it’s often also sugary and can spell a plaque build-up disaster for your teeth. Here are some sticky foods to avoid:\n\n\nToffee\nLicorice\nHard candy\nCaramels\nTootsie rolls\nAll gum (even sugar free)",
                "Drink sugar-free drinks. While you do need to take a big drink of something during a meal to keep food out of your braces, if that beverage has sugar in it, you’re just washing away food only to give your braces some bacteria-building material to hang onto. To keep your teeth free of decay-causing bacteria, follow every meal or snack with water.\n\n\nIf you absolutely have to, you may drink a sugary drink once a week if it is followed by water, which can pull any leftover sugar molecules away before they make purchase with plaque. #*Sugary drinks include: sweet tea, sports drinks, Kool-Aid, and soda."

        "wikiHow to Have the Dreams You Want": {
            "intro": "Why is it important to remind yourself that you're dreaming while dreaming?",
            "steps": [
                "Go to bed earlier. A sleep study conducted in 2011 for the journal Sleep and Biological Rhythms concluded that university students who stayed up later tended to have more unpleasant dreams than those who hit the sack earlier. If you want your dreams to be more pleasant, then try going to bed at least an hour earlier every night and see if that has a positive impact on your dreams.[1]\n\nOne potential explanation for this finding is that the stress hormone cortisol is released in the early morning, a time in which the night-owls were likely in REM (Rapid Eye Movement), or dream, sleep.[2]",
                "Control your diet. Nightmares can be triggered by a variety of things, including late-night snacking, alcohol, caffeine, or cigarettes.[3] If you have persistent nightmares, then consider cutting out these substances, and don't eat for two to three hours before you go to sleep. This will give you enough time to digest your food and will lead to a more restful sleep.\n\n\nIf you're serious about having deeper and more pleasant dreams, then you should avoid the caffeine after about noon. You may feel that you need the extra energy, but it'll make it harder for you to fall asleep.\nThough you may think that a glass of wine before bed will help you fall asleep, it will actually lead you to have a less restful sleep. And if your sleep is less restful and you want to actually control your dreams, then this will make it harder to do.\nAvoid sugar close to bedtime as well. Sugar can overstimulate you and keep you awake.",
                "Tackle stress. Oftentimes, negative dreams are a reflection of the stress or anxiety we are experiencing in our everyday lives.[4] Try not to dwell on these things while you are laying in bed trying to fall asleep. Instead, take a moment to clear your head and think of positive things. The more you focus on having a less stressful outer life, the calmer your inner life and your dreams will be.\n\n\nGetting regular exercise can help you ease stress levels, have better dreams, and get to sleep faster.[5] Don't exercise too close to bedtime, however, as this can keep you up.",
                "Have a more relaxing bedtime routine. It's important to ease into sleep and to have a relaxation routine, such as drinking herbal tea or reading a book, before you fall asleep so that your dreams are less likely to be scary or disturbing. Find whatever works best for helping you fall asleep and stick to the pattern you have developed. Try to push any stressful or painful thoughts from your mind as you ease into sleep.\n\n\nAvoid watching violent, scary, or otherwise stressful movies and television shows before going to bed, as these can cause nightmares.[6]\n\nIf you want a more restful sleep, turn off all visual stimuli at least half an hour to an hour before bed. That means no phones, no TV, no computer, and nothing else that will make it harder for you to turn your mind off and to have a more restful sleep.",
                "Put roses in your bedroom. Scientists conducted a dream study in which women were exposed to the scent of roses throughout the night for at least 30 nights, and reported having more pleasant dreams than usual.[7] It is believed that the scent elicits positive emotions, which in turn make dreams more pleasant.\n\n\nYou can also use rose-scented oils, body lotions, or candles. Be sure to blow out the candles before going to sleep, however, to prevent fires.",
                "Get enough sleep. Dreams occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a phase of the sleep cycle.[8] If you are not sleeping enough, or frequently wake up throughout the night, your REM cycles may be getting interrupted. You need to make sure to get between 7-9 hours of sleep on a regular basis and to go to bed around the same time every night so your mind and body know what to expect.",
                "Pay attention to your dreams. Many people believe that learning how to notice and remember your dreams is the first step to achieving lucid dreams.[9] Before you go to bed, remind yourself that you plan on waking up and fully recalling your dreams. This will eventually train your subconscious to pay better attention to your dreams. Here are some ways to better remember your dreams:\n\n\nUpon waking up, ask yourself what you dreamt. Don't get out of bed immediately, or it'll be harder to remember what happened. Instead, stay in bed and focus on the details of the dreams.[10] Part of the reason people \"forget\" their dreams is because they wake up and immediately begin thinking about other things. Get in the habit of asking yourself this question every single morning.\nWrite down your dreams. Do this immediately after you wake up, and keep a journal and pen at your bedside so that you can quickly write down your dreams before you forget them. This will also help you notice your dream patterns over time.[11] Make sure to keep the lights dim and to stay in bed while you write the dreams down. Staying in the twilight state will help you to remember more of the dreams you have.",
                "Perform reality checks while you're dreaming and throughout the day. Reality checks are tests that you can perform, both while dreaming and while awake, that help you differentiate between the real world and the dream world. Successfully performing a reality check while asleep can help you trigger a lucid dream, as your dream-self becomes aware of its state. Try the following reality check tests:[12][13]\n\nTry to fly. Obviously, this will only work in a dream. [14]\n\nLook at your reflection in the mirror. If your reflection is distorted, blurry, or not there, then you are probably dreaming.[15]\n\nTry to read a clock. The image will be too blurry to read in a dream. [16]\n\nFlick the light switches on and off. Light switches do not work in the dream world. Also, see if you can turn the lights on and off with your mind. If you can, then you know you're dreaming.\nLook at your hands. Check to see if they look normal from close-up. If you're dreaming, then you might have less or more fingers than normal.\nTry using an electronic device. Computers and telephones do not work properly in dreams.\nLook in a mirror. See if you look different.\nSee if you can \"breathe\" while closing your mouth and nose. If you can, then you're dreaming.\nTry to put an item, such as a pencil, through your hand, (the palm). If you are dreaming, the pencil will either go through inexplicably or hang in the air around your hand. If you aren't you'll get a graphite mark on your hand.",
                "Look for dream signs. As you get in the habit of recording your dreams, start looking for signs that you're really dreaming. It could be a recurring image, like an island you have never seen before in real life, or a recurring event, such as losing your teeth or getting so dizzy you can't move. Look for patterns that let you know that you're really dreaming and then write these down. Knowing these signs can help you be more aware of the fact that you're dreaming because you'll be able to recognize them more easily.\n\n\nOnce you recognize one of the dream signs in your dream, you can tell yourself that you are, in fact, dreaming.",
                "Play video games. One psychologist believes that video games familiarize people with operating in an alternating reality and viewing oneself from outside one's own body, skills that translate into the dream world.[17] Her research concluded that people who played video games were more likely to experience lucid dreams, and were better at controlling them.[18]\n\nDon't play violent video games before going to bed, as these can provoke nightmares. Make sure you stop playing them at least an hour before bed if you want to try this technique.",
                "Eat foods that are rich in melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is commonly found in plants, animals, and microbes. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant and has also been shown to boost REM sleep and to make dreams more vivid. Others also say that melatonin can help people fall asleep faster. If you want to be able to dream more vividly, fall asleep more deeply, and therefore, to have more control of your dreams, then you should eat some of the following melatonin-rich foods:[19]\n\nCherries\nOats\nAlmonds\nSunflower seeds\nFlax seeds\nRadishes\nRice\nTomatoes\nBananas\nWhite mustard\nBlack mustard",
                "Ask yourself if you're dreaming throughout the day. As you go about your day, whether you're sitting in class or checking the mail, make a habit of asking yourself, \"Am I dreaming?\" If you do this regularly, then it'll make it more likely for you to ask yourself if you're dreaming when you're actually having a dream. And if you do this, then you'll be able to realize that you are dreaming and to take control of your dreams, choosing whatever you want to happen.\n\n\nAsking yourself whether you're dreaming or not can heighten your alertness, which will also make you more likely to lucid dream.",
                "Meditate before going to bed. Being able to lucid dream requires that you be fully self-aware and undistracted by thoughts that relate to your waking life. While you are laying in bed trying to fall asleep, clear your head of distracting thoughts, and focus all of your attention on the fact that you are falling asleep and about to enter a dream state.\n\n\nMeditation will also help you clear your mind of all of the negativity that will keep you from having a restful sleep.",
                "Visualize your lucid dream. Before you go to bed, decide what you want to dream about.[20] Paint a vivid image of your surroundings, and be sure to include details like sights, sounds, and smells. Put yourself in the scene, and try moving around within it.\n\n\nPay attention to the sensations of breathing and walking around in this dreamscape. Though you are not yet dreaming, tell yourself \"I'm in a dream.\" Continue this visualization technique until you have fallen asleep.\nChoose your ideal location for optimal results.",
                "Leave dream signs at your bedside. Leave a photo, a symbol, or even a blank piece of paper at your bedside before you fall into sleep. Take something that represents the thing you want to dream about and leave it out before you go to bed so that it can help you transition into the dream you want to have. If you want to dream about a certain person, have that person's picture out near you. If you're an artist who is struggling to find a subject, leave a blank canvas at your bedside.\n\n\nTaking this measure can prime you to dream about the things you want to dream about because it will plant the kernel of these things in your mind before you go to sleep.",
                "Prepare yourself to control your dreams before you go to bed. As you lie in bed and get ready for sleep, tell yourself something as simple as, \"Tonight, when I dream, I want to realize I'm dreaming.\" Repeat this to yourself a few times and really focus on making it happen. This will help you get in the mindset you need to be in to recognize that you're dreaming.",
                "Sleep in complete darkness. If you really want to control your dreams, then you should sleep in complete darkness, or as close to complete darkness as you can. Sleeping in darkness keeps your melatonin levels high and promotes better dreaming and better dream recall. Ideally, there should be no difference between the darkness you see when you open your eyes in bed and when you close them. Avoid any dim lights, windows that cast a lot of light, or other elements that will keep you from being in the darkest environment possible.[21]",
                "Try the MILD technique. Stephen LaBerge of Stanford University, who founded the Lucidity Institute, created a technique known as MILD (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams) which has been called one of the most effective techniques for inducing lucid dreaming. Here is what you have to do:[22]\n\nWhen you go to bed at night, tell yourself that you will remember your dreams.\nFocus on realizing when you're dreaming, and also on remembering that it is a dream.\nImagine what you want to do during that dream, whether it's flying or dancing.\nRepeat the last two steps of realizing when you're dreaming and reentering a dream until you actually fall asleep.\nContinue using this technique until you are able to make yourself have lucid dreams.",
                "Make your nightmares go away. Though it can be difficult to control your dreams and make your nightmares go away, one thing you can try is to visualize an alternate ending to the nightmare. If you always dream about a scary man in your home, imagine yourself warding him off, or imagine him just leaving on his own. Whatever the scary dream may be, find a way to imagine it so that you come out as a victor and that the nightmare goes away.[23]\n\nIf you think about this intensely enough, write it down, and even say it aloud, then you may be able to reprogram the way your mind approaches the dream.",
                "Control your dreams in small ways once you realize you are dreaming. Once you've done a reality check and realize that you really are dreaming, try to stay calm and not get too excited about the fact that you're dreaming. If you do this, then it's likely that you'll wake up. Instead, stay calm and immersed in the world of your dreams, and start to control small things before you build up toward something more elaborate.\n\n\nYou can start carefully trying to change the scenery or just to move through the space of your dream. You can start to touch things, and attempt to make small objects appear or disappear.",
                "Take more control over your dreams. Once you're comfortably lucid dreaming and feel like you have a fair amount of control over your dreams, you can start to aim a bit higher when you try to control your dreams. You can make yourself fly, summon people, change the scenery completely, trying to return to a place from your childhood or even to travel through time. As you get more and more used to lucid dreaming, you'll be able to have the dreams you want more regularly.\n\n\nWhen you wake up, remember to record the dream. Mark the point at which you realized you were lucid dreaming, and write down all of the things you were and were not able to do. If there's something you are never able to do when you're lucid dreaming, such as flying, then ask yourself what's holding you back.",
                "Periodically remind yourself that you are dreaming. Once you're dreaming and have recognized that you're in a dream, you should tell yourself that you're dreaming every so often. If you don't do this, then you may forget that you are actually dreaming, and you won't feel as in control of everything that is happening. If you keep reminding yourself that you are dreaming, then you will feel more capable of changing and controlling your dream situation.",
                "Make yourself fly. One thing you can try to do when you're lucid dreaming is to fly. You may not be able to fly at first, but you can build yourself up to get there. You can tell yourself, \"Okay, now I'm going to fly,\" to make yourself get into the mindset of being ready to fly. You can start hopping around, jumping up and down, and moving your body in an upwards motion before you fully fly. Once you're more comfortable doing this, you'll be able to start hovering above the ground until you're flying.\n\n\nAs you're flying, don't be down on yourself or doubt what is possible. If you're filled with doubt, then you won't be able to truly fly. If you find yourself lowering, try taking a big hop or a jump and then take off again.",
                "Summon a dream object. You may also want to summon an object or something you really want to play with or hold in your hand. If you want to do this, then you have to be creative about how it can be possible. Maybe you want a delicious cake. Well, then first you should imagine that you're in a kitchen or a restaurant so that the cake can be brought out. If you're just thinking of the cake too hard, then it may not come to you, but if you create an environment that will make the cake more likely, then it will be in your hands.",
                "Change the scenery. You can also change the scenery in your dream if you try hard enough. Once you know you're dreaming, you can try to imagine opening a door that will lead you to your dream place, or you can slowly add parts of the scene to your scenario until you have the scenery you want. If you're trying to remember a childhood home, start by summoning your favorite tree in the backyard, then the back porch, then your back door, and so on, until you have created the world you want.[24]\n\nIt can help to have an image or a photo of the scenery you're looking for at your bedside before you go to bed. Make sure it's one of the last things you look at, so your mind is more ready for the adventure.",
                "Travel through time. Some people are able to travel through time in their dreams. You can imagine yourself getting into your own personal time machine or opening a door to a new world. If one thing isn't working, try another. You can even tell yourself, \"Now I'm going to travel through time\" and focus on making it happen without forcing it too much. It helps if you go to bed while thinking of the time in your life that you'd like to return to.[25]"

        "How to Clean Aquarium Gravel": {
            "intro": "Aquarium gravel serves not only as a decoration, but also as a filter. Because of this, it tends to harbor a lot of debris and waste. Cleaning gravel also removes some aquarium water. As such, most aquarium hobbyists will plan their gravel cleaning day alongside their weekly partial water changes.",
            "steps": [
                "Unplug the heater, filter, and pump. Before you do anything to your tank, you must unplug the heater and turn off the filter and pump. Don't worry, the cleaning process is quick, so your fish will be fine.\n\n\nDo not remove your fish, decorations, or plants from the tank.[1]",
                "Get out your aquarium vacuum. There are two tools aquarium hobbyists will use for cleaning their gravel.\n\n\nAquarium siphons usually have a thick, plastic tube or \"siphon\" with a thin, flexible, tube attached to one end. Some of these may have a priming ball attached to one end.\nPlastic, flexible tubes can also be used to clean gravel. These are ideal for smaller tanks.",
                "Place a bucket below the aquarium. The bucket must be beneath the water level. It will catch the old water.",
                "Start the vacuum by submerging it. Slowly lower the entire siphon into the tank so that all of the air gets out of the tube. Cover the end of the tube with your thumb and take it out of the tank; keep the other, open, end submerged. Place the covered end in a bucket. If you release your thumb, the water will begin to flow; if you cover the end again with your thumb, the water will stop.[2]",
                "Start the vacuum with a priming ball. Some aquarium vacuums come with a rubber ball attached to the end of the siphon. Stick the end of the siphon into the aquarium and lower the end of the tube into a bucket. Plug the end of the tube with your finger, and squeeze on the priming ball. Slowly let go of the ball, but keep the end of the tube plugged. Water will begin to fill the siphon, sort of like an eyedropper or turkey baster. When you unplug the end of the tube, water will start to flow into the bucket.[3]",
                "Know how to start up a Python, and other similar types of vacuums, if you are using one. These types of gravel vacuums are different from all others. They do not require a bucket. Instead, they need to be hooked up to a water faucet. Simply plug the end of the Python vacuum to your water faucet and place the entire vacuum into aquarium. When you turn the faucet on, the vacuum will begin to siphon.[4]",
                "Place the end of the vacuum into the gravel. Simply stick it straight down, as far as it will go. Your thumb should still be blocking the end of the tube, and that the end of the tube is in the bucket. Once you let go of the tube, dirty water will start flowing out.\n\n\nIf you have very fine-grit gravel, such as sand, don't stick the vacuum all the way down. Instead, place the mouth just over the top of the sand.[5]",
                "Let go of the tube. With the end of the tube still in the bucket, slowly pull your thumb away from the end of the tube. This will start creating the siphoning effect. Dirty water will flow out of the end of the tube and into the bucket. The gravel will shake and rattle inside the tube.\n\n\nIf you are using a Phython, or a similar type, simply turn the water on the begin siphoning.",
                "Cover the end of the tube once the water starts to run clear. How long this takes will depend on how dirty your aquarium is to begin with. When you recover the tube, the gravel will settle once again.\n\n\nIf the gravel starts to go too far up the vacuum, just cover the end of the tube and let the gravel settle. Then, uncover the tube and let the water flow again.\nIf you are using a Phython, or a similar type, simply turn the water off the stop siphoning.",
                "Remove the vacuum from the gravel, but not out of the water. Try to keep it as straight as possible, so that you don't dislodge the adjacent debris.",
                "Move the vacuum to the next patch of dirty gravel and repeat the process. Push the vacuum straight down into the gravel, and slowly release the end of the tube. When the water runs clear again, cover the tube back up and carefully lift the vacuum out.\n\n\nIf your tank has any caves, rocks, logs, and other nooks and crannies, be sure to give those special attention. These areas tend to get the most waste.[6]\n\nIf your tank has any live plants, leave a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) radius around the stems. Plants love organic waste. If you remove this waste, the plants won't have anything to eat.[7]",
                "Do not clean all of the gravel. Keep vacuuming until the water level is two-thirds of the way full. By now, you will have cleaned one-fourth to one-third of the gravel. This is perfectly fine. You do not want to clean more than that at one time. Aquarium gravel hosts a lot of good, helpful bacteria that is important for the health of your tank.[8] You can continue cleaning the gravel the next time you do a partial water change.",
                "Take the temperature of the tank's water. You have just removed a lot of dirty water, and you will need to replace it. Fish are very sensitive to water changes, so the new water will have to be the same temperature as the old.[9]\n\nMost tanks should have a thermometer, but if yours doesn't, you'll need to stick a clean, glass thermometer into the water.",
                "Fill a clean bucket with water that is the same temperature as your tank's water. Make sure that the bucket never came to contact with any chemicals or cleaners. Any residue left behind can be extremely deadly for your fish. Fill the bucket with water that is the same",
                "Treat the water, if necessary. Most tap water is not aquarium safe. Use any necessary water conditioners to remove chlorine and other harmful chemicals. You can buy these from an aquarium store or in the aquatics department of a pet store.",
                "Place the bucket above the water level of the aquarium. You will be reverse siphoning the water back into the tank. The bucket must be above the water level, or the water will not siphon back properly.\n\n\nSimply pouring the water back in might seem easier, but this can cause debris to rise up and cloud the water.",
                "Stick the entire rubber tube into the tank, and plug on end up with your finger. If you are using a gravel vacuum with a plastic siphon, see if you can pop the flexible tube off.",
                "Leave the uncovered end in the bucket, and place the covered end in the tank. Slowly let go of the tube. The water should start flowing back into the tank.",
                "Remove the tube from the tank when the water level is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top edge. This space is important. Fish need oxygen, and if you don't leave that space, the water won't get enough oxygen for your fish.[10]",
                "Re-plug the heater, filter, and pump. Once your aquarium is all set up again, plug the heater back in, and restart the filter and pump. Take note of when you cleaned your tank, and make a note on your calendar for the next cleaning date.",
                "Only clean gravel before putting it into your tank for the first time. This is the only time you should be cleaning gravel. Once your gravel is in the tank, you should only vacuum it. Gravel hosts a lot of good, helpful bacteria that are beneficial for your aquarium. Rinsing your gravel will get rid of that bacteria.",
                "Open up the bag that your gravel came in. Store-bought gravel must be cleaned. It often contains dust and dirt that can be harmful for your fish. If you picked your gravel up from elsewhere, you will want to clean it as well.[11]",
                "Get a colander or mesh strainer. The smaller your gravel is, the tighter weave you will need. Make sure that you are not using this colander or strainer for any other purpose. Also, make sure that the colander/strainer never came into contact with soap or other detergents. If you are cleaning sand, consider using a piece of cotton instead.",
                "Fill the colander or strainer with gravel. If you have a lot of gravel to clean, you may need to work in smaller batches. The gravel should enough room in the colander/strainer to move around without spilling over the edges.",
                "Place the colander/strainer into a sink and turn on the water. Use a warm or hot water setting. This will help kill any bacteria. Do 'not add any soap, detergent, or bleach. Doing so can kill your fish.[12]",
                "Move the gravel about until the water runs clear. Shake and jiggle the colander/strainer. Stick your hand into the gravel, and sift it about. Keep doing this until the water runs clear.[13]",
                "Transfer the gravel to your aquarium. Turn off the water and give the colander/strainer a final shake to get rid of any excess water. Spread the gravel along the bottom of your tank. If you still have more gravel to add, repeat the whole cleaning process for each batch."

        "wikiHow to Start a Yeast Free Diet": {
            "intro": "A yeast-free diet is one method that's been suggested to combat symptoms caused by Candida yeast infections. Not everyone agrees that it is effective, but anecdotally at least, many people stand by the results, so you may want to try it. The theory is that the natural balance of yeast within a person's system is thrown off by an overgrowth, so taking out yeast-containing foods for about six weeks can restore the proper balance and quiet the infection. People who are prone to yeast infections regularly may find it useful to reduce the amount of yeast in their diet overall.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider your symptoms. A yeast infection most commonly occurs as itching, burning and white patches either in the oral or genital area. However, some people have experienced further symptoms, including depression, headaches, fatigue, stomach pain, and indigestion.\n\nCommon, recurrent oral or genital yeast infections may be a sign of a more general yeast sensitivity. While the infection can be treated with a prescription, it is worth considering an underlying cause.\nSome yeast infections will not respond well to prescriptions and you may find trying a yeast-free diet useful just to regain the a balance that has been thrown off. Since it is not a high-risk endeavor, trying a yeast-free diet is a popular method for people suffering from persistent infections.",
                "Consult your GP. You should check with your doctor to be diagnosed, as many of the symptoms suggested are general and can be due to multiple causes. Candida yeast overgrowth can often be measured, but even that may not be certain, and diagnosis by symptoms alone is disappointingly speculative.\n\n\nIf it is believed to be a yeast infection, you can get a prescription for antifungal medication (preferably a six week course) which you can take while on this diet as it will help kill the yeast infection. Appropriate antifungals include: Diflucan (Fluconazole), Lamisil (Terbinafine HCL), Nystatin, Sporanox\nMany traditional practitioners are unconvinced [1] that yeast-free diets are medically useful, so don't be surprised if your GP is not interested in what you choose to eat. Diet changes are difficult to measure (and could depend on individuals) so evidence may be limited for practical reasons, but nonetheless, not much exists.",
                "Prepare to change your diet. Whether you are imagining this to be simply for the next month and a half, or possibly for the foreseeable future, changing your diet can be a big undertaking if you aren't mentally prepared. Any time an elimination diet is starting, it is important to know all parameters of the diet and to be fully prepared. This is the number one key to success. Try to prepare yourself in advance, and find supportive people.\n\n\nRemember that the first few days are likely to be the worst as your body transitions to a new diet. With a yeast-free diet, the physical balance in your body is thrown off even further before it rights itself, like trying to a right a boat in a rocky ocean.\nDon't reward yourself with ways to cheat on the diet — instead, reward yourself with things that you love in other contexts, like being allowed to spend money or waste time on something you enjoy. Like other elimination-type diets, even the smallest \"cheat\" can cause a relapse of symptoms.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the foods that are off-limits. While you don't want to concentrate on the negative in a diet, it is important to know the boundaries as you adapt to a new set of habits.\n\n\nStay away from anything that contains yeast, like most breads, processed foods, and baked goods.\nSugar in any form (this included sucrose, glucose and fructose) is also a danger as yeast feeds and grows on sugar.\nRefined grains, malted products, and fermented products (vinegar, soy, ginger, beer and wine), including all alcohol, either contain yeast or quick-acting carbohydrates which feed the growth of yeast.\nDairy products should be avoided, as with most cheese. The primary exception in this category is yogurt with living cultures.\nAny mushroom or fungus is out.\nIt is recommended that you avoid stimulants like coffee, chocolate, black tea and so forth, as they release stored sugar into the body and so provide a breeding ground for yeast. The same applies for artificial sweeteners and spicy foods.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the foods that you can eat. Much easier than creating a list of foods you can't eat, is to create a list of foods that you can eat and stick to those. Find ways to make these foods interesting and broaden your horizons if any of these foods are ones you have yet to try. Essentially you are aiming for a diet of fresh greens and fresh proteins, with limited fresh fruits and dairy (as they are higher in sugars), and complex grains. But get to know the details so that you can make foods you enjoy! Things you can eat include:\n\n\nFresh meat, chicken and fish.\nEggs.\nGarbanzo beans and lentils.\nAvocado.\nWalnuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, and coconut.\nBrown rice (no white rice) and rice cakes.\nAll vegetables, fresh or frozen, including onions and garlic.\nFruit that is not bruised (but no melons or grapes).\nLimited milk (125ml per day) or soya / rice milk.\nPlain yoghurt with active cultures.\nLow fat cottage cheese with no sugar.\nHomemade popcorn.\nPlain chips with no MSG.\nHerbal teas.",
                "Familiarize yourself with treats. These are foods allowed weekly (only one item of each), that won't throw off your balance entirely in one serving, but will disrupt things if they become habitual. Foods like these include:[2]\n\nWhole wheat pasta.\nTomato paste.\nCheeses such as Camembert or feta.\nTinned tuna in spring water (as opposed to fresh tuna, which is regularly acceptable).\nSpices.",
                "Continue this diet for four to six weeks. At the end of this period, the system infection should be gone, and all the symptoms relieved. If you are not feeling fit and healthy after committing to the diet for this period, then a yeast infection may not be the underlying cause of your symptoms as that should be long enough for your body to retain balance\n\n\nAnd, as with any allergy, removing the culprit from your diet for a set period is a perfect way to test for a sensitivity. The trouble can be that while some allergies have very clear, obvious reactions like a skin rash or asthma attack, you may consider the symptoms of a yeast sensitivity difficult to be sure about. It's important to remember to trust what you feel.",
                "Slowly add foods back into your diet over a period of a few weeks. If your infection has cleared up and you would like to start eating certain foods again, it is safe to do so slowly without triggering the same infection.\n\n\nHowever, if you are sensitive to yeast infections in general your system will still react to a high level of yeast or yeast-generating environments. Therefore, it is sensible to add foods back slowly and be aware of any negative reactions. This way, you can determine whether it is a sensitivity to yeast or to something else you happened to stop eating.\nYou may find that you feel better on a yeast-free diet for the long-term, as some systems are prone to yeast imbalance. You can try it and see!",
                "Change your attitude. The primary thing to keep in mind is that you will be focusing on eating completely fresh foods — nothing fermented, nothing baked, nothing fungal, and nothing that is likely to have attracted any growths. While there is more to it than that, this overall mental attitude can help you make decisions when you come across a new food. Don't have an \"I can't have that\" attitude; have an \"I choose not to have that\" attitude!\n\n\nThink of your food not as a treat for your mouth but fuel for your entire body, and choose things that will be pleasing for every part of a healthy you. Mentally associate positive health and feeling good with the foods that are beneficial, and remember the consequences of the foods that are off-limits.",
                "Remove yeast from your diet. If you think a yeast-free diet may be more healthy for your body type overall, try working toward taking yeast out of your diet for good. Rather than thinking about specific foods that are or aren't allowed, imagine creating a diet that will serve your body most effectively.\n\n\nGluten-free diets have become more popular among a wide range of people, but it has been suggested that some of those cases may actually be yeast allergies, since the two show up in many of the same places. If you have tried a gluten free diet that works some of the time but not always, it may be worth investigating where the two differ.",
                "Partner up with a friend. Mutual support is a great way to keep a project in the air, and a healthy diet will benefit anyone. Even if you are not eating exactly the same food, congratulating one another and reminding each other what's off limits is more useful than you might think. It can keep you motivated and help you hold yourself accountable.\n\n\nPlanning meals in advance can keep your momentum going. Two people are better than one since there will be back-up if either of you starts to fall off the wagon, and preparing food will be a motivating force.\nEating together is a positive social interaction. Certainly not everyone will have the time to spend every meal together, but even checking in on a regular basis will make a difference. Whether it's dinner every day with a spouse or lunch once a week with a co-worker, any form of patting each other on the back is a plus.",
                "Talk to a nutritionist. If you are serious about changing your relationship to food, it is worth planning meals that you like and that are good for you. A professional can help you determine the best combination to meet your needs.\n\n\nEach individual will find a different arrangement of meals that works best, so talking to someone can be a useful method to make starting a new diet a good experience, rather than stressful or frustrating. Remember, eating food that is good for your body should ultimately be pleasing. It may take a period of adjustment, but don't expect to suffer endlessly. A nutritionist can help figure out what you need to be satisfied.",
                "Create breakfast that you will eat. Some people think of breakfast as something they grab as they run out the door, while others believe it is the most important meal of the day, and has to have enough calories to get the day started. Recognize your own tendencies and interests, and make meals that are right for you.Consider these options when making Breakfast:\n\n\nOne piece of fruit.\nPorridge – oats or rice cereal.\nYeast-free bread or rice cakes.\nEgg with avocado and tomato.\nCottage cheese.",
                "Create lunch and dinner that you'll enjoy! Do you need to bring food with you to work? Are you cooking for two (or more) at home? Some people like to eat small amounts and just snack a lot, while others want to have a nice big plate of food at dusk. Get to know what you really want to eat. Consider these options for lunch or dinner:\n\n\nLentil soup.\nAny meat with plenty of vegetables.\nVegetable stir fry with brown rice.\nCold chicken with cottage cheese.\nPotato salad.\nHummus sandwich on pita bread.\nAvocado sandwich on sourdough bread.",
                "Write down ideas you come across so that you can start building up your own collection of options. You will start to use certain ideas regularly, and have a selection of go-to dishes, as everyone tends to on any diet (one they are watching or not), but it is always worth keeping a few possibilities nearby to mix things up now and then.\n\n\nYou can do a search for yeast-free meals to look for new recipes, as there are always new ideas being posted and talked about online. Sometimes you will simply be reminded of ingredients you haven't thought to use in a long time - and the same stir-fry can be a whole different meal whether you center it around bok-choy and carrots or brussels sprouts and kale.\nYou can also just look up a few of your favorite ingredients, and modify the results a little if it's necessary. Remember that you can usually replace regular milk with soy milk, or vinegar with lemon juice, so long as the recipe is simple."

        "How to Stop Complaining": {
            "intro": "Complaining is a common pastime for many people. Some people even bond over their mutual complaints about restaurants, politics, the weather, and even their own lives. However, addictive it may be, complaining can actually create a cycle of negativity. Learn how to control the level of complaining you do and use your voice for positive statements.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn assertiveness. Many people complain as a passive-aggressive tactic when they don’t know how to ask for what they want. You might complain about doing certain activities or favors simply because you do not know how to say “no.” The first step in becoming more assertive is getting in touch with your own needs/wants and then being able to say no to things that do not align with them.[1]\n\nStart small with assertiveness. Express how you feel about an invitation that you need to decline, such as “Thanks for the invite to the birthday party, but I won’t be able to attend.” Use similar tactics for bigger issues as they come up.\nGuilt also plays a huge role in not being able to say no, let go of the guilt because in all reality it would be impossible to say yes to every invitation or to every project someone asks you to help with. You have just as much right as anyone else does to decide what things you can do and what things you cannot. An honest reply should not come with guilt on your part.",
                "Strive to adapt to change. While change may be uncomfortable at times, it is important to understand that change is a constant part of life.[2]\n\nAnxiety can play a role in not wanting to deal with change, but learning to recognize those feelings as being natural and also temporary can help in working past them. Be willing to ask for clarification if you need to about to how things are going to change and request support as needed.\nIf you do need to speak up about an issue relating to some sort of change, find positive ways to assert yourself instead of complaining. Offer solutions or suggestions for changes instead of pointing out the worst in the situation.",
                "Own your own mistakes. Accept responsibility for your part in the way things are. Complaining can stem from not being ready to take ownership of your own role in either the problem or the solution.[3]\n\nIf you are unhappy in your current environment, own your part in getting to where you are. This can be done by acknowledging your role just as you acknowledge others. Also realize you are the only person with the power and responsibility to improve any aspect of your life if you are unhappy with it.",
                "Offer constructive criticism instead. Unlike complaining, constructive criticism offers solutions or information to help the problem-solving process instead of just pointing out the negative in the situation. Constructive criticism generally does not contain the negative undertones or blame that complaining or nagging does. It is simply a way to stand up for yourself in naming and then fixing the problem.[4]\n\nFor example, if you have become frustrated at work by the way a co-worker performs a certain task you could complain about it by telling the co-worker their work is poor or making a big deal about having to re-do whatever project .\nOr, you could say “Hi, Joey, your last project could use some improvements. Is there any additional training you require to get up to par on [given task]? What can we do to make sure the project is getting done correctly the first time?”",
                "Practice gratitude. Avoid getting stuck in the rut of complaining about things you take for granted. Take time each day to point out a few things that you are happy about in your life.[5]\n\nIt may seem like everyone naturally complains about returning to work on Monday morning. Instead, learn to value having a job to go to each week. Not everyone is able to work or, if they are, they may be unable to find work that meets their financial needs. Complaining about work just makes the job seem even worse than it really is and more of a burden than it needs to be.\nComplaining about family often again seems like something everyone does. It may seem natural to complain about your teenager, but be grateful you are able to meet your family’s basic needs so your biggest worry is how busy they keep you running from event to event.",
                "Stop judging others—and yourself. Complaining not only judges others harshly but it also often sets you up to be your own worst critic. Sometimes, people judge others merely because their way is different.[6]\n\nLearn the difference between someone doing something different than your preferred way and doing something “wrong.” Someone may take a different route to get things done. But, if the outcome still meets the goal, that’s all that matters.\nAppreciate the value of diversity instead of focusing on differences. You may find yourself actually growing and learning from those who are different from you, if you open yourself up to different views of things around you.",
                "Look for the lesson in unfortunate situations. Focus on the here and now, and forgive so you can learn from what has happened instead of getting stuck in the fallout from the bad event.\n\n[7]\nGive yourself time to vent, get angry or feel however you need to in the moment. Then let those feelings go and free yourself to move forward. It is a mistake to feel the need to hide feelings because you never get to deal with them and then move on.\nKnow that each mistake is a chance to change how you act in the future, and this is a huge part of learning. Think of all the things you have learned in the past just by encountering and gaining knowledge after a mistake.",
                "Recognize that the world is imperfect. Allow yourself to be imperfect and recognize the fact that those around you also will be imperfect at times. No matter how well-prepared you are for any life event, things may not go the way you expect or plan. Being prepared for this may lead you to become more flexible to find solutions in the moment instead of being overwhelmed by something going wrong.[8]\n\nWith major events like a wedding, birthday or even school activities you can often put undue pressure on yourself and others to make everything perfect. Learn to focus on the most important things and recognize many small details would go unnoticed by the average person.",
                "Learn mindfulness. Mindfulness uses concentration and acceptance to maintain presence in the moment.[9] Mindfulness is a great way to overcome complaining because it allows you to accept the present moment and all that comes with it.\n\n\nPractice mindfulness by sitting quietly in a comfortable chair or on a cushion. Breathe deeply—in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on your breath, clearing your mind of all other thoughts. When you notice your mind wandering, simply bring your attention back to your breath without judgment.[10]",
                "Exercise to boost your mood. Self-care and taking steps to make sure you are in your best physical shape can go a long way in changing your outlook.[11]\n\nInstead of complaining, use the extra energy you would waste on the negative to squeeze in a good workout. Use a long walk as a break from stress at home or spend 30 minutes doing cardio to sweat out the frustration you might otherwise complain about.\nUsing physical activity to give your body a boost also will help with your mood as moving your body releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins. Being in poor health or poor physical fitness can be yet another thing to complain about. Exercise is a constructive way to improve your physical and mental well-being.",
                "Practice relaxation techniques to alleviate negative feelings. Be mindful of your triggers and which audiences tend to bring out the most complaints, and then work to find ways to relax instead of reacting. Great ways to relax may include deep breathing, meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, or even going for a nature walk.[12]\n\nIf you are able to make yourself aware of some of the major triggers you can prepare yourself with positive affirmations or even role play different ways to respond to the triggers. In order for a trigger to work it depends on a knee jerk reaction from you; learn to take away that power by relaxing or otherwise preparing yourself.",
                "Keep moving forward. Embrace the opportunity and power to make changes in your day to day life. Each day is a chance to do better than before. Start with small steps to move forward and build on what you have learned from past mistakes.[13]\n\nEmbrace the chance to experiment and mix things up a bit. Open yourself up to try new things even if you are not sure if they will be successful. Strive to enjoy the experience instead of driving just for success."

        "How to Calm Yourself Before Meeting Someone": {
            "intro": "You may have an important meeting coming up, or a job interview, or a first date. You may be worried about how you are going handle meeting someone new, and are anxious about what you are going to say. Spend some time preparing for your upcoming interaction by learning some relaxation techniques to calm your nerves, or by visualizing a successful encounter with the person you are about to meet. When the time arrives for your meeting, you can take some steps to convey confidence and readiness, like dressing appropriately and showing a positive attitude. Meeting new people can cause some anxiety, but if you are prepared, you can feel more confident in your interactions.",
            "steps": [
                "Change your language. You may feel butterflies in your stomach or tightness in your chest. Consider that, in our bodies, nervous energy and excited energy often feel very similar. Therefore, it may not be hard to have your brain make the switch as well. Tell yourself “I’m so excited to meet this person!” rather than “I’m so nervous!” and see how your outlook changes.[1]\n\nIt’s easier to tell yourself that you’re excited, rather than to calm down, when you are anxious. You already have all the physiological responses of excitement going on, so it’s easier to make yourself believe you are excited, rather than force yourself to calm down — which is at the opposite end of the physiological spectrum.\nFor example, you may have an important meeting with your bank coming up. Instead of thinking, “I’m dreading this meeting,” you could tell yourself, “I am so excited to meet to talk about this loan!” It sounds silly, but if you laugh at yourself, even better! That will help you relax.\nTell yourself how you are anticipating your meeting rather than being worried about it. For example, “I can’t wait to meet with my new boss tomorrow!”\nIf you can tell other people as well, even better. The more ways we can get the brain to process this as a positive event, the better. Call a friend and tell them how much you are looking forward to meeting the person.",
                "Breathe. Try to clear your mind of worries and focus on your breathing. Breathing is one of the best ways to reduce stress. Just ensure you are taking deep breaths (into your abdomen, not your chest) to get the benefits of stress relief and relaxation.[2]\n\nShallow breathing can make you feel anxious.[3] A good way to make sure you are breathing into your abdomen is to your hands on belly button, and watch them rise and fall. Your belly should lift your hands and your chest should not move.[4]\n\nIf you can, try lying down and feeling your belly rise and fall with air. Focus on nothing but your breathing for a few minutes. If you are not able to lie down, sit with your eyes closed, and practice breathing, perhaps using a word or image to help you relax.",
                "Relax your muscles. Softening and relaxing the muscles communicates to the brain that there is nothing to worry about in the environment around you. When nervous, many people pace, bounce a leg, pick at their clothes, clench their jaws, wring their hands, etc. This alarms the brain and initiates panic. Progressive muscle relaxation — tensing then releasing your muscles methodically — may help you calm down.[5]\n\nTry doing a “body scan,” starting from the top of the head and scanning down to the tip of the toes, relaxing every muscle along the way.[6]\n\nTry these techniques in the hours or even days before the encounter, then try it right before meeting the person. This allows you to walk into the situation without tension in your body and without nervous tics like those listed above.",
                "Clear your head with meditation. Meditation can help you relax, de-stress, and get focused for your meeting. It will help you feel calmer by lowering your blood pressure. While meditation takes some practice, simply closing your eyes, breathing deeply, and clearing your mind through focusing on your breath can be beneficial.[7]\n\nIf you are stressed about an upcoming meeting a few days away, you could set aside some time each to day to relax using meditation. The extra practice will improve your meditation skills, but will also give you greater calm and focus.\nYou can find guided meditations online or download meditation apps to help you.",
                "Remember, they are a person just like you. Even if you are meeting the Pope or the Prime Minister, remember, they are just another human being. Do not make them any larger-than-life than they are. Stay positive and open-minded, but keep practical expectations.[8]\n\nFor example, you may be nervous about meeting someone you met online for a first date. They may seem like Mr. or Ms. Right from their profile, but stay open-minded to the possibility that they very well might not be. Readjust your outlook from “first date” to “getting to know someone better.”",
                "Go easy on yourself. Don’t get anxious about making mistakes. Things happen, and most of the time, you will find other people gracious and willing to help you out. And if they are not, your encounter will not last forever. Once you get some distance from the meeting, you will probably find a way to find some humor in it (or at least your friends will).[9]\n\nYes, it’s possible you may have a foot-in-mouth moment when you are meeting someone for the first time, but don’t obsess over such a scenario. If it happens, apologize, admit your embarrassment, and move on.\nThink of a graceful apology if you make a mistake. For example, if you have been calling this person by the wrong name for the past hour, you could say, “Oh my goodness, I am so embarrassed! Please accept my apology!”",
                "Imagine your conversation. If you are nervous about what you are going to say or do, try visualizing it in your mind. Imagine the scene in detail. Visualization allows you to imagine the successful outcome of your encounter, and help you become more confident because you have “prepared” for it in your mind’s eye. This preparation teaches your brain to respond in this way when another similar event occurs.[10]\n\nVisualize all the details of your encounter. If you are visualizing meeting a potential employer at a job interview, for example, you may wish to visualize yourself driving up to the interview location, walking up to the building, and finding the correct office. Visualize the suit you will wear to the interview, shaking hands with the interviewer, and sitting down at a table. Continue this process and visualize the entire interview.[11]\n\nAllow yourself to feel the emotions you would ideally like to have when you meet this person. For a job interview, you might want to imagine yourself feeling confident, prepared, and excited to learn more about this new opportunity.\nIncorporate all of your senses into your visualization. If you are picturing a first date at an Italian restaurant, smell the garlic and marinara in the air. Taste the lasagna you will order.\nVisualize positive outcomes. Imagine a successful job interview, a fun first date, or a productive meeting with a new supervisor.\nYou can also visualize an actual encounter from your past that went well. This can trigger memory of strategies that worked well while also framing the upcoming encounter in a hopeful light.",
                "Practice visualizing regularly. Make it a daily habit, first thing in the morning or the last thing you do before you fall asleep. Successful visualization takes practice and commitment. Think of it like exercise: the more you do it, the stronger you get, and the easier it gets.[12]\n\nClose your eyes and sit up straight during your practice, so you don’t accidentally doze off.\nYou may wish to work with this in conjunction with a meditation practice.\nYou may wish to close your visualization exercise with an affirmation, like “I am confident and brave,” or “I’ve got this!”",
                "Write it down. Another effective way to visualize is to write down how you would like your meeting to go. Writing out your visualization allows you to focus even further, and also allows you to return to the same visualization again and again by rereading your words.[13]\n\nWrite your visualization in a private place, like in a journal, or put it in an electronic document that you can pull up easily. Consider reading it on your phone during your commute, for example.",
                "Have a positive attitude. Staying positive will help you remain calm and looking forward to meeting this new person. Plus, the other person will find it much easier to interact with you when you appear positive and receptive to talking to them.[14]\n\nGive yourself a mini-pep talk with a word or phrase meant to help you stay centered and positive, like “Go get ‘em!” or “Stay strong!”\nThink well of yourself. Believe in your ability to have a successful encounter with this new person. For inspiration, think about all of the ways you are successful in your life: You can do all those things, and you can do this, too!",
                "Dress to impress. Wear an outfit appropriate to the occasion that you look and feel good in. For a job interview, you may want to wear a suit or other clothing appropriate for an office setting. For a first date, you may wish to wear jeans and a nice sweater, or your favorite dress.\n\n\nFor professional settings, it’s okay to wear clothes that convey your personality (such as a brightly-colored blouse, eye-catching statement jewelry, or a colorful tie), just be sure you don’t overdo it! When it doubt, aim for a more conservative look.[15]",
                "Use confident body language. Your body language conveys lots of information about you to the other person. Convey confidence and positive energy by standing up straight, making eye contact, and smiling when you greet the person.[16]\n\n\nShake hands. Greet the person with a confident, firm handshake. Make sure you look them in the eye while you are shaking hands.[17]",
                "Speak clearly. Make sure you speak loud enough so that other people can hear you, and that you are looking at the other person, not at your feet, when you greet them. A clear, articulate, warm speaking voice makes you appear calm and confident.[18]\n\nAlso be mindful that you are not speaking too fast, which often occurs when people are nervous.\nGreet the other person with a warm, friendly hello. Say their name in your greeting. “Hello, Marisol, it’s so nice to meet you!”[19]",
                "Establish a rapport with the other person. Observe the other person in their surroundings, and look for ways to start a conversation. Look for ways to connect with them over common interests. While many people dislike small talk, it is a way to find common ground and begin building a relationship.[20]\n\nLook for conversation cues in your surroundings. Look at the other person’s clothing: Is there something they are wearing you could compliment them on? Is there a beautiful piece of artwork on their office wall? Find something to talk about for a few minutes before you settle into the business at hand. If you can’t think of anything, you can always talk about the weather!\nFor example, you may be in a meeting in someone’s office. On their desk is a family picture. You could say, “What a beautiful picture! How old are your children?”\nFor example, your first date is wearing a pin with the name of a political candidate you support. You could point to it and say, “Nice choice! I think she’d make a great mayor!”\nTake note of the person's name and use it periodically throughout conversation. This makes you seem personable and likable. Also use their name when you thank them or say goodbye at the end of the encounter."

            "intro": "Many people are scared of spiders. And it is definitely a good idea to be careful of the venomous kind. But just as many people enjoy keeping spiders as pets. They are pretty low maintenance and can be really entertaining. Spiders are interesting creatures that can make great pets. Just make sure to choose the one that's right for you. You'll want to give your pet a safe, comfortable home and keep him healthy.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn which spiders make good pets. It is important to make sure that you choose a spider that suits your needs. For example, do you want a non-venomous spider? Do you want a large spider? Ask yourself these types of questions. You also want to choose a spider that will do well in captivity. While not all spiders make good pets, these spiders are ones to consider:[1]\n\nTarantulas\nWolf spiders\nJumping spiders\nFishing spiders\nGrass spiders",
                "Purchase a spider. Consider buying a spider to keep as a pet. This option allows you to get the exact species that you want. You'll also be able to ask the seller for information on how to care for your new pet.[2]\n\nYou can purchase many types of spiders at pet stores. Tarantulas are a very popular option.\nThere are also many reputable online sellers. Just make sure to specify whether you are planning to breed your spider(s), and how old you want it to be.\nIf you live with your parents or roommates, make sure that everyone in the household agrees to house the spider.",
                "Hunt for spiders. You can also choose to skip the store and catch a spider in the wild. Just make sure to do your research first. You should make sure that you know how to identify the different spiders that live in your area. You also want to be certain that you know how to handle the spider you catch.[3]\n\nYou can look for house spiders and widow spiders in and around your house. Check window sills and cracks in walls or windows.\nJumping spiders make interesting pets. Look for them in grass and bushes. A great way to find spiders is to look for their webs.",
                "Capture a spider. When you go looking for spiders, take a glass jar with you. Make sure that your jar has a lid. You should also poke holes in the lid to make sure that your spider will have air on the way to its new home. Have an adult help you with this, as you'll need to use a sharp tool.[4]\n\nIf you see a spider hanging out on a plant, you can place your jar under the spider. Gently move the leaf or branch so that the spider will drop into the jar.\nYou should also carry a card or stiff piece of paper with you. You can use this to scoop a spider off the ground and gently place it in your jar.",
                "Buy a cage. One of the most important parts of keeping a spider as a pet is making sure that it has a safe, comfortable home. You can purchase a ready-made habitat for your spider. An aquarium that you can buy at a pet store will work just fine.[5]\n\nMake sure that the cage is at least 2-3 times the spider's leg span. This will ensure that it has plenty of room to move around.\nAdd materials to make your spider feel at home. You can place leaves, dirt, and rocks in the cage.\nSpiders also like to have somewhere to hide. If you have a large enough cage, you can place a small flower pot on its side in the cage. You could use a piece of wood, too.",
                "Make your own cage. If you are capturing a small spider, you might want to consider a homemade cage for your spider. You can use a glass jar. If you have a big, gallon size jar, that would be great. Ask a local restaurant if you can have one of their empty jars.[6]\n\nMake sure to thoroughly clean the jar. Rinse it with water and mild soap and then dry with a clean cloth.\nYou can add the same materials to your jar that you would add to an aquarium. You can also consider adding peat or moss to make a comfortable floor for your spider.\nRemember that air flow is important. Poke holes in the lid of the jar to make sure that your spider is getting enough air.",
                "Choose the right spot. Picking a good spot for your spider's new home is important. You want to make sure that it will be safe. Choose a stable surface such as a table or counter. You don't want your spider to accidentally get knocked to the floor.[7]\n\nMake sure that household pets or young children won't be able to accidentally set your spider free.\nMost pet spiders, such as tarantulas, don't need special heating or light. The natural light in a room will be enough. Just make sure they don't get much colder than 70 degrees.",
                "Feed your spider. You can feed your spider insects. Try not to overfeed your spider as they are at a larger risk of an abdomen burst should they fall from a distance. Make sure to feed spiders about once or twice a week.[8] If the spider's abdomen becomes crumpled, feed immediately.\n\n\nYou can hunt for your own bugs to feed your pets. Just make sure they come from an area without pesticides.\nYou can also purchase insects at most pet stores. Stock up on a supply of crickets to feed your spider.\nMake sure to firmly seal the tank (or jar) after feeding your pet. Spiders (especially tarantulas) are great at escaping.",
                "Provide water. In addition to food, you need to provide fresh water for your spider. You can use a plastic bottle cap as a water bowl if you have a small spider in a small cage. If you have room, give your spider a small bowl of water.[9]\n\nSpiders will also drink the water off of damp webbing. But you need to make sure that your cage doesn't become damp. Spiders do not thrive in humidity.\nRefill your spider's water every couple of days, or more frequently, if you notice it is empty.",
                "Handle your spider carefully. If your spider is small and fragile, you should avoid handling it. But if you have a sturdier spider, such as a tarantula, you can hold it. Just remember to be careful and handle your spider properly.[10]\n\nCarefully pick up your tarantula by the leg between your second and third fingers. Place it in the palm of your hand. It is not a good idea to let your tarantula crawl all over your body--you might lose it.\nTarantulas do not need to be handled. Try to handle your pet as little as necessary.",
                "Observe your pet. Spiders are really interesting creatures. You can keep an eye on your spider so that you can get to know it better. Keep track of what it most likes to eat, when he likes to sleep, and when he is active.[11]\n\nTry keeping a notebook near your spider's cage. You can record its habits."

        "How to Place an Egg in a Beer Bottle": {
            "intro": "Have you ever seen science shows where they \"magically\" make an egg fall into a bottle? It’s not so much magic as it is a study in air pressure. With a few household items, you too can get an egg into a bottle without even touching it.[1] You may not be able to get the whole egg into the beer bottle. Because the mouth of a beer bottle is much smaller than the egg, the egg will split, but some of it will still be pushed into the bottle.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather the necessary materials. To get an egg into a beer bottle, you will need an egg, a pot, water, a stove, a glass beer bottle, vegetable oil, a small strip of paper, and matches. Remember, because the mouth of the beer bottle is small, you probably won’t get the whole egg into it. If you want to get the whole egg in, you must use a bottle with a wide enough mouth for the egg to rest comfortably on without falling through.[2]\n\nParental supervision is recommended for both boiling the egg and working with the matches.\nA small to medium sized egg works best for this.\nUse a glass bottle for this because the bottle will be in close contact with fire.\nCut a strip of paper thin enough that it can fit through the mouth of the bottle and not stick out the top.",
                "Hard-boil the egg. Place the egg in a pot. Put enough water in the pot to submerge the egg and bring it to a boil. Once the water boils, remove it from the burner and let the egg sit for 9-12 minutes. The egg will cook while it is sitting in the hot water.[3]\n\nRemove the egg from the hot water and let it cool.",
                "Peel the egg. The easiest way to peel an egg is to run it under cold water or submerge it in ice water to cool it. Crack the egg gently on a hard surface to break the shell. As you start peeling, run the egg under cold water to make the shell peel away more easily.[4]\n\nFresher eggs are more difficult to peel than older eggs.",
                "Rub vegetable oil around the inside rim of the bottle. Get some vegetable oil on a paper towel or on your finger and rub a light layer around the inside of the mouth of the bottle. The vegetable oil increases lubrication and allows the egg to slide in easily.[5]\n\nThis step is not necessary, but is recommended.",
                "Light the paper on fire and drop it into the bottle. Strike the match to light it and then light the edge of the paper on fire. Drop the lit piece of paper into the glass bottle. Make sure you are using a glass bottle for this.[6]\n\nProceed immediately to the next step after this.\nAsk a parent for help with this step.",
                "Place the egg on the rim of the bottle and watch. Once the lit paper is inside the bottle, place the peeled hard-boiled egg on the mouth of the bottle and watch what happens. The egg will wiggle, the flame will go out and then the egg will get pushed into the bottle through the mouth.[7]\n\nThe flame heats up the air inside the bottle making it expand. This hot air escapes past the egg causing it to wiggle. Once the flame consumes all of the oxygen it will burn out and the air in the bottle will cool down.\nCool air exerts less pressure. Because the air outside the bottle is warmer it exerts more air pressure and pushes the egg into the bottle.",
                "Gather the necessary materials. To get the pieces of egg back out of the bottle you will need baking soda, vinegar, and a plate.[8] This experiment is essentially the reverse of what you did to get the egg into the bottle. You will increase the air pressure inside the bottle so the egg will get pushed back out.\n\n\nYou need about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of baking soda and 3 tablespoons of vinegar.",
                "Add vinegar to the bottle. Three tablespoons should be enough, but exact measurements aren’t necessary.[9] With the bottle upright pour the vinegar into the bottle avoiding the egg as much as possible.",
                "Spoon the baking soda into the bottle. Once the vinegar has been added, spoon the baking soda into the bottle on top of the vinegar. You may need to give the bottle a little swirl to mix everything.[10]\n\nOnce things start bubbling, proceed immediately to the next step.",
                "Flip the bottle upside down over the plate. Immediately after adding the baking soda, flip the bottle upside down. To avoid making a mess, flip it over the plate to catch the solution that falls out. Make sure the egg pieces are positioned so that it blocks the mouth of the bottle.[11]\n\nThe baking soda reacts with the vinegar creating carbon dioxide gas. As the gas is made, the air pressure inside the bottle increases. The increased air pressure inside the bottle causes the egg to get pushed back out of the bottle."

        "wikiHow to Recognize and Treat Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease": {
            "intro": "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a relatively common viral infection among infants and children. It's most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, although other viruses are implicated also.[1] HFMD is characterized by mouth sores and skin rashes on the hands and feet. It's a mildly contagious infection spread through contact with bodily secretions and fluid from ruptured blisters. Recognizing HFMD is important in order to be able to treat it properly and take precautions from spreading it to others.",
            "steps": [
                "Look out for fever and reduced appetite. HFMD usually affects children younger than 5 years old and the infection typically begins with a mild-to-moderate fever and loss of appetite.[2] The fevers in children with HFMD usually reach 101°F (38.3°C) or 102°F (38.9°C), which is the body's way of trying to stop the virus from multiplying and spreading. In addition to fever, look for loss of appetite at meal times, which is typical of most viral infections.\n\n\nThe time between viral contact and the start of symptoms (known as the incubation period) is typically between three to seven days.[3]\n\nYoung, pre-school kids are most often affected, although teens and adults do come down with HFMD occasionally.\nThe most common time of year for HFMD outbreaks is in the summer and early autumn.",
                "Watch for sore throat and painful mouth sores. Although a fever is often the first sign of HFMD, after about one to two days of higher temperatures painful sores usually develop in the throat (causing a moderate-to-severe sore throat) and elsewhere in the mouth.[4] The red sores are fairly small (2 or 3 mm in diameter) and quickly develop into blisters (vesicles), then they pop and become ulcers (the most painful stage). In addition to the throat, the most common areas for HFMD sores to appear are the tongue, gums and inner cheeks.[5]\n\nBlisters/ulcers from HFMD can be difficult to distinguish from canker and herpes sores. The main differences are canker sores rarely affect the throat and gums, whereas herpes sores almost always appear on the outer lips.\nThe discomfort created by the throat and mouth sores make it painful to eat, which may further reduce appetite.",
                "Expect to see a rash on the hands and feet. If the throat and mouth sores are indicative of HFMD (and not cankers, herpes or some other viral infection), then a rash will invariably develop on the hands and feet within an additional one to two days.[6] The small red blisters characteristically appear on the palms of both hands and the soles of both feet. Less commonly, the blisters can also appear on the knees, buttocks, genitals and elbows.\n\n\nIn addition to the small blisters, HFMD causes the skin on the hands and feet to appear like a rash, although it's not usually itchy — unlike chicken pox, which is another type of infection that HFMD often mimics.\nFingernail and toenail loss can occur with HFMD, particularly in children, within about two to four weeks of coming down with the condition.",
                "Prepare for malaise and headaches too. Other symptoms commonly associated with HFMD (and most other viral and bacterial infections) are dull/achy headaches and malaise — a general unwell and tired feeling.[7] These symptoms and the ones mentioned above usually last for between five to seven days. In the vast majority of cases the infection is self-limiting and doesn't require medical attention.\n\n\nWith malaise, children may not want to get out of bed in the morning, or play during the afternoon or stay up much past dinner time.\nHeadaches are difficult to detect in young children who can't communicate well, so look for reduced attention span, unexplained crying, head holding (with their hands) and avoidance of loud sounds and/or well-lit areas of the house.\nNausea/vomiting is not common with HFMD (and many other viruses that affect the throat and mouth), but it is characteristic of bacterial infections and food poisoning.\nNot everyone gets all of these symptoms (especially adults who have more mature immune systems to fight the infection), but non-symptomatic people can still pass the virus on to others.",
                "Be patient and remain hydrated. HFMD is not serious in most cases, so letting it run its course (about a week) is the best way of gaining natural immunity and preventing future infections. As such, be patient and keep well hydrated, which is good advice for any viral infection, but particularly important for HFMD because of the pain associated with swallowing. Fevers and nights sweats cause your body to lose more water than normal, so start with drinking eight 8-ounce glasses per day to rehydrate yourself and keep your mucous membranes of your mouth/throat moist.\n\n\nConsider buying some mouthwash, oral spray or lozenges from the pharmacy that contain compounds that numb or dull a sore throat.[8] They can be effective to reduce pain and make it easier to consume liquids and soups.\nYou may also want to encourage hydration by offering something cold that might soothe the throat, like a sugar-free popsicle.\nCommon signs of dehydration include: dry skin and mucous membranes, sunken-looking eyes, reduced urination, dark-colored urine, irritability, confusion and weight loss.[9]",
                "Consult your doctor about medications. There's no specific treatment for HFMD in terms of medication, in part because the infection is not serious and usually clears up on its own within a week to 10 days;[10] however, over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help reduce a fever, and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can reduce inflammation and pain associated with blisters and ulcers. Remember that aspirin is never a good idea for young children and ibuprofen may not be either, so ask your doctor.\n\n\nA mild-to-moderate fever is beneficial to fight viral infections as noted above, but temperatures of 103°F (39.4 °C)or greater in children should likely be managed with medication.\nDrugs called antivirals are recommended for infections within people who have a high risk of complications due to weak immune systems. Antivirals kill viruses or prevent them from reproducing in the body. In rare cases, antivirals may be prescribed for HFMD, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex) or famciclovir.\nNote that valacyclovir and famciclovir medications are only approved for use in adults, not kids.",
                "Consider taking colloidal silver. Colloidal silver (also called atomic or ionic silver) is a liquid preparation containing small clusters of electrically charged silver particles. The medical literature reveals that colloidal silver has powerful antiviral properties and can kill a wide-variety of viruses, although there is no quality research demonstrating its effect on HFMD as of yet.[11] Even still, considering its relative safety, lack of side effects and affordability, it might be worth a shot for treating HFMD.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of colloidal silver against viruses depends on size (particles should be less than 10 nm in diameter) and purity (no salts or protein in the solution).[12]\n\nColloidal silver can be made at home with some specific supplies, or purchased from most health food and supplement stores.\nTry gargling with colloidal silver to help relieve throat and mouth sores, and spray some on your hands and feet to prevent outbreaks of blisters.\nSilver solutions are usually considered non-toxic even in high concentrations, but protein-based solutions made by some pharmaceutical companies can increase the risk of argyria — skin discoloration due to silver compounds getting trapped there.",
                "Avoid contact with people who show signs or symptoms. HFMD is mild-to-moderately infectious and is spread by contact (usually via the mouth) with an infected person's: nasal secretions, throat mucous, saliva (including droplets sprayed from coughing and sneezing), fluid from blisters and feces (poop).[13] Therefore, if you see anyone (especially young children) looking ill and complaining or exhibiting the above mentioned symptoms, avoid them until they are recovered.\n\n\nYou may have to keep your child out of preschool or elementary school for a week to either prevent getting HFMD or spreading it to others.\nTeach your child to notify adults if they feel ill or see symptoms such as red spots or rashes on the skin of other children.",
                "Practice good hygiene. Because HFMD is contagious and transmitted through touch and body fluids, keep your hands (or those of your children) disinfected.[14] Always wash hands with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and changing diapers. Try not to touch your mouth with your hands, especially after you've touched someone else. Avoid sharing eating utensils or cups/glasses with people with HFMD or other viral infections.\n\n\nRegularly disinfecting countertops, tables, chairs, toys and other surfaces which are commonly touched is a good preventative approach.\nDisinfect your hands (and your children's hands) multiple times per day with regular soap, and don't go overboard on the hand sanitizer because it can promote the growth of \"super bugs\" that are resistant to medications.\nNatural disinfectants appropriate for household use include white vinegar, lemon juice, salt water, diluted bleach and hydrogen peroxide.",
                "Maintain a strong immune system. With any type of infection, true prevention depends on the strong and healthy functioning of your immune system. Your immune system is comprised of specialized cells that search and destroy potential pathogens such as viruses, but when the system is weak, disease-causing microorganisms grow and spread virtually unchecked. As such, it's not surprising that those most at risk for infections, including HFMD, are young children and the immunocompromised.[15] Therefore, focus on boosting your immune system in order to stay healthy and be able to fight off HFMD successfully.\n\n\nGetting more sleep (and better quality sleeps), eating more fresh fruit and veggies, cutting down on refined sugars (soda pop, candy), reducing your alcohol intake, quitting smoking, practicing good hygiene and exercising regularly are all proven ways to keep your immune system strong.[16]\n\nDietary supplements that can boost immunity include: vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.\nVitamin C and olive leaf extract also have antiviral properties, which may also help to prevent or fight off HFMD."

        "How to Encourage Your Dog to Sleep in Your Bed": {
            "intro": "Many people enjoy having their pets sleep in bed with them. It can feel comfortable and safe to sleep with your canine companion. Some dogs may be skittish about sleeping in the bed and it may take awhile to get your dog used to your sleep schedule. However, with some time you'll be sleeping with your dog each night.",
            "steps": [
                "Allow your dog to sleep in the room. Do not invite your dog into the bed with you right away. For several reasons, this is a bad idea. You need to ease your dog into sleeping in your bed. Start by letting him in your room at night.\n\n\nTo start, move your dog's bed in your room. Coax him to bed with you when you go to sleep at night. Allow him to take some time getting used to your bedroom.\nDogs can become stressed by new routines. If your dog is used to sleeping in his own bed in the living room, sleeping in your bed is a whole new behavior. This can be stressful and your dog may be hesitant at first.[1]\n\nAlso, you need to make it clear that you're in charge. If your dog thinks the bed is his, he may become territorial about it. This could lead to him taking up too much space or whining when he can't get in the bedroom. These kinds of behaviors should not be encouraged or reinforced.[2]",
                "Reward your dog for noticing the bed. Start small. Some dogs will willingly hop on any comfortable bit of furniture. However, other dogs may be cautious about anything unfamiliar. If your dog is unsure of your bed, start with tiny rewards. If he glances at the bed, approaches it, or sniffs it, reward him.[3]\n\nDogs live in the immediate. Reward the action as soon as it happens. It might be helpful to keep a small bag of treats in the bedroom. This way, you'll be able to reward your dog as soon as the behavior occurs.[4]\n\nThere are many ways to reward a dog. Some people buy training clickers at a local pet store. When the dog behaves, they click and give him a small treat. The dog will learn that a clicking sound means he's done something right. However, if you don't want to go that route you can simply offer the dog praise when you see him noticing the bed and provide a small treat as well. Dogs tend to respond well to food as a reward.[5]",
                "Teach your dog to wait for an invitation before jumping on the bed. If you want your dog to sleep in your bed, train him to wait for an invitation first. Dogs need a certain amount of structure. If your dog hops on and off the bed at his own desire, he may become territorial about the bed. Make sure he knows it's your bed and he's allowed on when you say so.\n\n\nTeach your dog to sit before the bed. If he starts trying to jump in the bed, say, \"No\" and then have him sit. Wait a few moments and then say something like, \"Go to bed!\" while patting the bed to signify that it's time to sleep.[6]\n\nDo a few training sessions each day while you're still establishing the rules. You can use positive reinforcements, like praise or treats, when your dog completes the behavior successfully.[7]\n\nEventually, you'll want your dog to come sit by the bed and wait for an invitation before climbing in bed with you each night.[8]",
                "Reinforce the desired behavior with a command. It can be helpful to have a command that tells your dog it's time for bed. This can make bedtime smoother for both of you. For example, when you're ready to turn out the lights you could say something like, \"Go to bed.\" This tells your dog it's time to hop in the bed and lie down. Each night, as you're winding down to rest, say, \"Go to bed\" right before you turn out the lights. You want your dog to associate this command with sleep time.[9]",
                "Be patient if you have a cautious dog. Some dogs are more skittish than others. If your dog is nervous by nature, it may take awhile to get him used to your bed. Cautious dogs are generally slower to learn new behaviors. They may need more rewards as encouragement. If you have a cautious dog, go slowly and reward often. It may take a few months to get your dog sleeping in the bed with you if he's generally nervous.[10]",
                "Provide positive reinforcement. Dogs need a lot of positive reinforcement to behave. Once your dog is comfortable in your bed, provide positive reinforcement. Each night, when your dog gets in bed with you, give him praise or a treat to show him he's behaving properly.",
                "Create positive associations with the bed. If your dog is a slow learner, it can help to create positive associations with the bed. Your dog will be more eager to join you in bed each night if he thinks of the bed as a place where happy, fun things happen.[11]\n\nTry feeding your dog on or near the bed. You can lay down a towel over the bed to prevent a mess.\nPut some things your dog likes in the bed with you. Allow him to have some of his toys and blankets in the bed.[12]\n\nSpend some time just sitting in the bed with your dog. Watch TV or read a book and allow your dog to hop up on the bed with you. Periodically pet him or praise him.\nBe careful, however, not to teach him to associate anything too disruptive with the bed. You want him to sleep through the night and not disturb you. Therefore, playing with your dog in the bed may be a bad idea.",
                "Discourage unwanted behaviors. Dogs respond well to negative reinforcement as well. Some behaviors can be disruptive to sleep.\n\n\nDogs may not respond well to punishment or scolding. It's sometimes easier simply to ignore bad behaviors. If your dog sees he's not getting a response, he may stop. For example, if your dog is whining or barking at night, just ignore it. Yelling at him might make him feel like you're barking back, encouraging him to keep it up.[13]\n\nIf your dog is continuing to behave poorly, taking something away is also an effective means to discourage the behavior. Sometimes dogs act out to get your attention, good or bad, and yelling may only encourage bad behavior. Instead of scolding your dog when he's being disruptive at night, consider putting him on the floor. Do not let him back into the bed until he's calmed down. Eventually, your dog will realize certain behaviors result in him being removed from the bed. He'll stop engaging in those behaviors.[14]",
                "Respect your dog's comfort zone. It's great to have your dog sleep in the bed with you. However, it should be a positive experience for you and your dog. Many owners enjoy snuggling with their pets, but some dogs may dislike being handled, especially if they're trying to sleep. If your dog growls or fidgets in response to cuddling, refrain from the behavior. Allow your dog to sleep in his own space.",
                "Exercise your dog around bedtime. If you share a bed with your dog, it's important he sleeps through the night. This way, you'll both get a good nights sleep. One way to encourage your dog to sleep is to exercise him a few hours before bedtime. Take your dog for a walk in the late evening. Spend some time playing with him in the living room with his favorite toy. This way, your dog won't be wired when you turn off the lights.[15]",
                "Stick to a regular sleep schedule. You are the highlight of your dog's life. He wants to be awake when you're awake and near you when you're sleeping. If you want to make sure your dog is getting enough sleep, stick to a regular sleep schedule. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each night, both you and your dog will have higher quality sleep. There will be less tossing and turning at night.[16]",
                "Take your dog out right before bedtime. Your dog may have difficulty sleeping if he needs to use the bathroom. Take your dog out right before you go to bed. If you go to bed late, you don't need to walk your dog around the block. Simply let him step out onto the sidewalk or backyard to have a quick pee. He'll be more comfortable when sleeping and more likely to fall asleep fast.[17]",
                "Leave ice cubes in your dog's bowl. Your dog may get thirsty during the night. However, drinking too much at night can put stress on his bladder. If he needs to go out, it'll be harder for him to sleep. You can put a few ice cubes in his dog bowl at night. If he gets thirsty, he can lick the ice cubes.

        "How to Spot Termite Damage": {
            "intro": "Each year, termites cause significant damage to structures and crops in subtropical and warm, arid regions of the United States. Homeowners spend billions of dollars annually to treat infestations and repair termite damage. Early detection is crucial in limiting the scope of a colony's destructiveness, but it can be difficult to do. Homeowners seldom see termites, which lurk in subterranean nests and devour wood from inside walls, but there are ways to detect their presence.",
            "steps": [
                "Inspect wood that's suspected to be damaged. If you suspect termite infestation, cut away a piece of wood at the site, if possible. Different types of termites leave distinctly different patterns of damage in wood.\n\n\nSubterranean termites devour soft wood and eat along the grain. This produces a distinct honeycomb pattern in the wood. It is crucial to stop subterranean termites as soon as the infestation is discovered. One type, the Formosan termite, is especially voracious, due largely to its massive numbers. Formosan termite colonies can number in the millions. Left unchecked, these pests can inflict considerable damage on homes, fences and utility poles.\nDrywood termites excavate large sections of wood by chewing along and against the wood grain. Their appearance is serious, but less so than most subterranean types. Drywood colonies usually number only a few thousand members and usually take several years to reach that number. Even when they reach such numbers, the entire colony eats only about 1/2 pound of wood per year.",
                "Look for other evidence of termite infestation. If you look carefully, you may be able to find clues of termite infestations, even if you're unable to see the insect itself. Visual signs of a termite colony can include floors that buckle or sag, loose tiles, pinpoint holes in drywall, damaged wood crumbles easily, or wood that sounds hollow when tapped. [1]\n\nShelter tubes running from the soil to above-ground wood. When subterranean termites exhaust their natural sources of wood, they will move to structures. They do this by building small, enclosed passageways, or tubes, to ensure safe access to the building. The tubes are made from soil, saliva, fecal matter and other material. The tubes indicate that termites are active.\nDrywood termites live inside wooden constructions, including structural timber, furniture and hardwood floors. Because they live inside the areas they feed on, they're almost never seen outside the colony. But they do leave signs of their presence. Drywood termites push fecal pellets, called frass, outside their tunnels and chambers. These wood-colored mounds accumulate on flooring under infested sections of wood. [2]",
                "Listen for clues. When conducting a periodic inspection of your home, tap sections of wood with a large screwdriver. If the wood sounds hollow, it might have been damaged by a wood-boring pest. Inside your home, hold a stethoscope or other device against different walls. You won't be able to hear termites, but carpenter ants make soft, rustling sounds as they rummage around in their chambers.[3]",
                "Learn to distinguish termites from other household pests. Termites are just one of several types of wood-boring insects that damage homes. Carpenter ants and certain beetles also devour wood. It's important to determine which pest has infiltrated your home in order to chart the proper course of action against the colony. The easiest way to figure out if your home is threatened by termites or another pest is to closely examine the insect. Termites have certain characteristics different from ants and beetles.[4]\n\nWorker termites often are pale yellow in color and have soft bodies. Carpenter ants and beetles are usually much darker in color and have hard exoskeletons.\nTermites have straight antennae, very different from the elbowed antennae of carpenter ants.\nBecause termites usually are hidden from view, it's easiest to determine the type of infestation by examining the winged version of the insect. When a termite colony gets large enough, winged reproductive termites will emerge to create a new colony. Termites have 2 sets of wings of the same size. In carpenter ants, the front wings are much longer than the rear set. Beetles have a set of hard wings that protect the delicate wings used for flight. The hard wings are part of the insect's exoskeleton and fold out from the body during flight.\nTermites have no discernible waist along their segmented bodies. Carpenter ants have a very distinct pedicle that joins the thorax to the abdomen.",
                "Get rid of dead trees and stumps around your yard. Decaying wood is top food source for termites and can attract a colony of hungry termites. [5]\n\nIf you keep a lot of firewood or spare construction materials on hand, keep them as far away from your house as possible. If you bring this wood into your house, make sure to look for signs of termite presence like holes in the wood or hollowed feeling or sound.",
                "Use treated wood to build structures. The chemicals in treated wood can act as a deterrent to termites. If you build something outside like a gazebo, deck, or anything above ground, treated wood can help make it less appealing to a wandering colony of termites.",
                "Inspect common termite entry points. The most common way they get into your house is through wood to ground contact, such as a door frame, deck posts, or wood support beams. Address these spots by examining them for signs of termites regularly, get rid of any standing water in the area, and treat the wood with termite prevention like soil treatments that repel termites. [6]",
                "Avoid spreading mulch too close to your home. You can have mulch in your home but you'll want to avoid putting it anywhere that it may touch your siding or foundation. Mulch creates moisture in the soil and prevents woods from growing, both conditions termites seek. [7]\n\nThis also includes your plants. Woody shrubs that touch the wood foundation or siding of your house can help attract termites and also help hide their presence.",
                "Install termite shields. This can be especially helpful if you are currently constructing a home. These are metal shields put along the foundation of your home to deter termites. These should be made of a non-corroding metal with no gaps. This can prevent termites from getting access to the wood foundations or structures of your home. [8]",
                "Decide how badly the wood is damaged. If the wood is completely hollowed out, or completely rotted, you will not be able to repair it and will need to replace the wood.\n\n\nRemove the damaged wood. Once you see there are parts of the wood that are damaged or completely rotten, you will want to use a chisel to remove these parts.",
                "Use a wood filler or hardener. You can fill in damaged parts of wood using a wood filler or hardener. Use a putty knife to spread the filler or hardener in parts of the wood that were damaged or ate away at by the termites. Allow it to dry over night. [9]\n\nMake sure to get any bubbles out of the filler or hardener so that you do not leave any gaps in the wood. Wood filler is best for long hallowed out groovers and hardener is good for larger gaps.",
                "Replace the wood completely. If it is a structure like a deck, your best bet will be simply removing the affected pieces of wood and replacing them with new pieces.\n\n\nYou can do this yourself or call a contractor, depending on how handy you are."

        "wikiHow to Temper an Egg": {
            "intro": "Many different recipes, including those for custards, soups, and certain pasta recipes, will require you to \"temper an egg,\" which means that you need to raise the temperature of an egg gradually, essentially cooking it without scrambling it. A tempered egg will look basically like raw egg, but will be perfectly cooked, and useful as a binding agent or thickener. You can learn the basic process involved, as well as more specific instructions for tempering eggs for use in specific dishes. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Get the proper utensils. Whatever the dish you’re making, tempering eggs for it is a lot easier than you might think. As long as you work quickly and by adding only a small amount of hot liquid to your eggs, your eggs will be tempered in no time. To do it right, you’ll need:\n\n\nHeat resistant bowl. It’s important to beat your eggs in a tempered glass (like Pyrex) bowl, or a ceramic bowl, so it won’t heat up and cook the eggs from underneath. You want the liquid to do the cooking, not the surface, which will cause the eggs to curdle.\nWhisk. The technique requires that you aggressively whisk the eggs while adding hot liquid, making a whisk useful. In a pinch, a fork is a fine alternative.\nLadle. You’ll need something to spoon the hot liquid from the pot, preferably a large ladle with a spout, so you can control how much you add.",
                "Start by whipping your eggs in the bowl. Depending on your recipe, you might have anywhere between 1 and 6 eggs that you’re preparing to temper, but the process will be the same regardless of the amounts. Crack all your eggs into your heat resistant bowl, then beat them until thoroughly integrated.[1]\n\nContinue whipping the eggs until they just become frothy. Beaten eggs, as you’d make for scrambled eggs, will be more likely to curdle, since the consistency will be thicker. You want more of an omelet consistency. When you start to see a foam appear on the top of the eggs, you’re in good shape.\nLet the eggs sit and come up to room temperature while you make the rest of the recipe. It’s more difficult to temper very cold eggs, so it’s important to let them come up to room temp gently before tempering.",
                "Spoon in some hot liquid to the eggs while whisking vigorously. Whether you’re making a savory dish or a custard, the next step is basically the same. You want to add a small amount of the hot liquid you’re using to temper, while whisking the eggs vigorously at the same time. When you’re sure the eggs haven’t curdled, add a little more. Continue in this way until the eggs are tempered.\n\n\nStart with a tablespoon or two and wait until you’re sure it isn’t curdling to add more. Some recipes will play fast and loose with the instructions, telling you to add a whole ladle full of boiling milk to eggs. It’s safer to start with smaller amounts and gradually bring the heat up. Continue adding until you’ve increased the volume of the eggs by at least half.",
                "Pour the tempered egg into the hot liquid, when it’s ready. Eggs are tempered when the mixture is steaming, and you can feel the heat in your hand holding the bowl. At this point, the eggs are essentially cooked without having scrambled. You can pour it all in at once, give it a few stirs, and the tempering is done. You don’t have to worry about the eggs curdling at this point.\n\n\nThe mixture helps to thicken broths and custards, creating a rich sauce. When you pour it back in, you should notice the broth or the milk thicken somewhat, and take on a cloudier, yellowy tint.",
                "Strain curds you make accidentally. If you rush the process by trying to add too much heat at once, you might notice a few curds start to form. Don’t panic, but stop adding the hot liquid and stirring the eggs. Get a spoon and fish out the curds, or run the egg mixture through a strainer if necessary and restart the process. If the whole thing as curdled, throw it out and start over.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can just ignore some curds if you don’t mind the texture. Keep whisking vigorously and you’ll hardly even notice the texture.",
                "Heat milk just to boiling on the stove. If you're making eggnog, custard, pudding, or ice cream, almost all recipes will start with scalded milk, or milk brought just to a boil. Whip your eggs in a heat-resistant bowl and go about the process of heating the milk over the stove according to the recipe you're using.",
                "Mix the appropriate amount of sugar into the eggs. For some recipes, you'll need to measure out the sugar into the eggs before you temper the eggs. If this is the case, measure it out and add it to the eggs. Whisk them together vigorously while the milk heats.[2]",
                "Start with a few tablespoons of milk. Remove the milk from the heat after it's scalded and add a very small amount of milk to the heat-resistant bowl with the eggs and sugar in it. Use your ladle and spoon out about a tablespoon into your whipped eggs, whisking vigorously while you add. Make sure the eggs haven't curdled before adding more.\n\n\nIf it helps, count to ten in between additions of milk, just to be sure you're not rushing it. That's slow enough that you'll probably be safe from curdling.[3]",
                "Continue adding until all of the milk has been added. Keep spooning the milk into the eggs, a little at a time, until you've transferred all the milk over to the egg bowl. Depending on what you're doing with the recipe, you might add this mixture to dry ingredients or chill it down for ice cream. Either way, you've tempered the eggs and you're ready to move forward with the recipe.",
                "Don’t season the eggs. Adding salt to beaten eggs starts breaking down the proteins, releasing moisture and creating a less uniform consistency in the egg mixture. This means that the eggs will temper less evenly when you add broth. Season the broth after the eggs have been tempered and added into the soup, not before you temper the eggs.",
                "Start with a very small amount of broth. Ladle out some of the broth, spooning in a small amount to the bowl with the eggs in it. Whisk the eggs vigorously while you add the liquid. Count to ten before you add another spoonful and allow the temperature to come up gradually.\n\n\nTry as best you can to only use broth to temper the eggs. Depending on what kind of soup you're making, it can be hard to avoid little chunks of vegetables or meat. It's fine if you get a bit of veg in there with your eggs–it's all going together anyway–but the eggs will whisk easier with just broth and egg, and the eggs will temper more quickly.",
                "Continue adding until the bowl is steaming. Continue adding broth in small amounts and put your hand on the side of the bowl to check for the temperature. Look closely for steam. If you're doing it properly, the eggs should still be perfectly liquid, but should be steaming and warm, meaning that they're tempered properly. When you see steam, your eggs are tempered.",
                "Pour the mixture back into the soup pot. When the bowl is steaming as much as the pot with the broth, you can pour the tempered eggs directly into the soup. Stir the eggs around to enrich the broth with the tempered eggs. The broth should thicken some–not much–and will take on a cloudier, slightly yellowish or milky color.",
                "Temper eggs into dishes with long noodles. One way of tempering eggs common in Italian cooking is to add raw egg directly to hot pasta to create a rich sauce. Most famously, this is the technique used for making spaghetti carbonara, the simple combination of noodles, egg, pancetta (or bacon), and lots and lots of black pepper.\n\n\nCarbonara is typically made with spaghetti noodles, but also can be made with any noodle you like to eat. Technique-wise, it's sometimes easier to temper the eggs in the pan using longer noodles, which tangle together to create a larger surface and keep the eggs off the bottom of the pan, so they won't scramble. You can do it with any noodle, however.",
                "Beat some shredded cheese into the egg mixture. While your pasta cooks, beat about 2 eggs in a bowl and add enough shredded parmesan cheese to double the amount. This can be more than you'd think–around a half cup or so of shredded parmesan. You can use other kinds of cheese, but drier, flakier cheeses like parmesan usually integrate more easily into the egg and melt more quickly than some other kinds.\n\n\nIn a carbonara, you'll also add lots and lots of black pepper to the eggs before you add it to the pasta. The pepper is where the dish gets it's name–the pepper grains look like bits of \"carbon.\"",
                "Heat the pasta gently in the skillet. For most recipes, you'll fry up some kind of meat, onions, garlic, and spices in a skillet first, then remove the pan from the heat. Cook your pasta separately, then add it to the skillet with the other ingredients. Put the skillet on low heat, stirring the noodles in the meat and vegetables to heat it gently.\n\n\nThe goal is to warm the egg on the top side of the pasta before it works through to the bottom of the pan, where it will likely start to curdle. It takes temperature control and good stirring to make it work correctly.",
                "Stir the pasta vigorously while adding in the egg. Pour the egg over the pasta noodles in the skillet over low heat, using a wooden spoon to stir the noodles around vigorously. Continue agitating the noodles, moving them around constantly. They should cook very quickly, and you want to avoid letting them curdle on the bottom of the skillet. Remove the skillet from the heat when you see steam and fork the noodles into a separate bowl.\n\n\nEggs cook much more quickly than most people think, so heating the noodles through gently and having them at the proper temperature when you had them should temper the eggs very quickly, coating the noodles in a rich and thick cheesy sauce. Season with chopped parsley and serve immediately.[4]"

        "wikiHow to Make Your Girlfriend Feel Special": {
            "intro": "It's not always easy to make your girlfriend feel special. You may feel like whatever you say comes out wrong, or that your attempts at romance are always thwarted. Or maybe you feel like showing up at her place with a DVD and a bag of Doritos is enough to make her swoon. Whatever you're struggling with, wikiHow is here to tell you how to make your girlfriend feel like the most special person in the world -- because that's who she is, isn't she? See Step 1 to get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Give her genuine compliments. If you want to make your girlfriend feel special, then you can't just say, \"You're like, super hot.\" You've got to put a bit more effort into it to show her that you really care and that you're aware of the things that make her really unique. You can compliment her looks, an aspect of her personality, or just something about her. Just remember not to force it; if you're complimenting her just to get her to like you more, she'll be able to tell. Here are some examples of great compliments you can give that sound natural:\n\n\nCompliment an aspect of her personality. Say, \"I love how you're so good at keeping your cool in a stressful situation. I need to learn how to do that.\"\nCompliment her looks. Say, \"I just love the color of your hair. It's so pretty and unique.\"\nCompliment something else about her. Say, \"You have so many friends who really care about you. You're so good at maintaining your friendships.\"",
                "Ask her questions about her life. If you want to make your girlfriend really feel special, then it's about more than just telling her the color of her eyes reminds you of the ocean. You have to show a real interest in who she is as a person, what she does on a daily basis, and her worries and fears. She has to feel that you don't just see her as your girlfriend, but as a human being with her own worries, interests, and ideas. Though you shouldn't interrogate her, you should ask questions naturally throughout your time together. Here are some things you can ask her about:\n\n\nHer childhood\nHer day\nHer goals for the future\nHer friendships\nHer relationship with her family\nHer fears\nHer hobbies\nThe things that make her happiest",
                "Ask for her opinion. You don't want your girlfriend to feel like an object. You want her to feel like you actually respect her intelligence and value her opinion about a variety of subjects. Let her see that you really do care about her thoughts and opinions and that you value what she has to say when you make a big decision. Here are some things you can ask her opinion about:\n\n\nBooks\nLife decisions you're making\nCurrent political issues and situations\nA movie or concert you both saw",
                "Be an amazing listener. It's important not only to say the right things, but to listen in the right way. If all you're doing is talking and talking and worrying about saying the right thing, chances are that you're not taking the time to really listen to your girlfriend. You have to make eye contact, give her your full attention, and make sure that she feels like you really care about what she has to say instead of just waiting for her to stop talking so you can say what's on your mind.\n\n\nDon't interrupt her. Let her finish what she has to say before you say anything.\nYou can nod and squeeze her hand from time to time to let her know that you're really listening.\nPart of really listening is remembering what she tells you. So, if she's telling you about a fight she got into with her sister, you can ask her how things are going with her least favorite sibling when you see her next.",
                "Say the right things when she's upset. It's hard for guys to know what to say when a girl is upset. Sometimes, you may feel like anything you say will only make things worse and will end up making her even more upset. While there are no perfect words you can say to make every girl feel better, you have to get to know your girlfriend to see if she's the type who feels better just from telling you everything on her mind or if she needs you to comfort her and tell her a million things to make her feel better. Here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n\nDon't try to \"solve\" her problem right away. She may just need to vent for a little while before you two can talk about what she should do next.\nDon't say things like, \"I know exactly how you feel\" and then compare her situation to your own experiences when she's trying to tell you something. This will make her feel like you only care about yourself.\nKnow if she needs to be left alone. If everything you're saying is making her feel worse, then she may just need some time to herself. Don't force her to talk about her problems if she's not ready.",
                "Encourage her. If you want your girlfriend to feel really special, then you have to encourage her to achieve her dreams, feel good about herself, and to go about her life in a positive, fulfilling way. Let her know that she's awesome before her big tennis match; tell her she's the smartest person you know before she takes a big test or goes in for an interview; make her feel important when she's feeling like nothing is going right for her. Though you don't want to give her false confidence, you should make it clear how awesome you think she is so that she always feels special and ready to face whatever comes her way.\n\n\nSay things like, \"I know you're the right person for the job. You're so smart, talented, and great with people.\"\nSay, \"Don't let the other team intimidate you. They know you're the one who's a real force to be reckoned with.\"",
                "Check in with her. If you want to make your girlfriend feel special and like you really care about her, then you can't just go MIA if you're not together. While you don't want to smother her by calling her every five seconds, you should check in with her every once in a while if you're spending some time apart. If you're apart for a day or two, just one phone call or a few cute texts each day should do the trick.\n\n\nIt's okay if you're not a phone person. You don't have to force yourself to have long conversations when you'd rather just talk in person. However, if she does like to talk on the phone when you're apart, take a few minutes to let her know you care and to see how she's doing.",
                "Be a gentleman. You don't have to be Prince William to sweep your girlfriend off her feet. Just follow a few gentlemanly rules and your girlfriend will be feeling special in no time. Being a gentleman is about treating your girlfriend like a lady and paying attention to her needs and wants. And, of course, about making her feel special. Here are some things you can do:\n\n\nHold doors open for her\nPull out her chair before she sits down\nOffer her your coat when she's cold\nLet her order first\nCheck in to see that she's feeling happy\nAvoid being overly vulgar\nHave good manners",
                "Have fantastic date nights. Don't just take her to Papa John's and bowling every Friday night. Make an effort to plan regular date nights that are special, fun, and exciting. Though you can't go skydiving during every date (unless you're on The Bachelor), you can make an effort to keep your relationship feeling fresh and exciting by doing new things while also making time to do the things you love to do most together. Here are some great date night ideas:\n\n\nInviting her over and cooking a meal for her or cooking a meal together\nTaking a stroll through your town and window shopping on a nice evening\nEating a type of cuisine she's never had before\nSeeing a romantic movie and going mini-golfing\nTaking a painting class together\nGoing for a run together\nPicnicking\nMini-golfing",
                "Don't aim for perfection. You don't have to try to do everything perfectly in order to make your girlfriend feel special. In fact, if you're so obsessed with planning the perfect date nights and being the perfect gentleman, your girlfriend may even get bored or feel like you're not being yourself. While it's great to make your girlfriend feel special, if you try too hard, she may feel like you're putting on an act.\n\n\nIt's okay to make mistakes sometimes. If you do, though, just make sure to apologize. Nobody's perfect, and it's better to apologize than to try to act like nothing went wrong.",
                "Give her help when she needs it. To make your girlfriend feel special, you have to be there for her, and not just during the fun times. You have to be there to help her with her homework, give her rides if her car breaks down, or to bring in the groceries if she needs a hand. Though, like many women, your girlfriend may be strong and independent, there will be times when she needs your help (just like you will need hers), and you have to be there to deliver.\n\n\nYou also have to be able to tell when she means it when she says she'll be fine on or her own, or if she's just too proud to ask for help.",
                "Don't smother her. There's a difference between making your girlfriend feel special and in making her feel like she can't breathe. Make sure to give your girlfriend space to hang out with her friends, pursue her own interests, and to do her own thing while maintaining your relationship. Sure, sending her flowers every week will make her feel special, but so will recognizing that she's her own person and letting her do what she wants without feeling threatened or jealous.\n\n\nIf you know she's having a girl's night, don't text her every five seconds to see if she's having a good time. You don't want to sound needy and this is likely to make her feel annoyed, not special.",
                "Be affectionate. Giving your girlfriend love and affection will definitely make her feel special. Give her passionate kisses on the lips, or softer, sweeter kisses on her forehead or cheeks. Put your arm around her, hold her hand, or just take the time to cuddle or snuggle with her when you're alone. You don't have to be all over her to let her know that she's special to you with some physical affection. Not everyone is into holding hands or kissing in public, but you have to figure out what level of affection will make your girlfriend feel special.\n\n\nIf you really hate holding hands, link arms with her when you're walking.\nBrush her hair out of her face or gently run your fingers through it.\nPut your hand on the small of her back if you're walking into a place together.",
                "Stay spontaneous. Think you've found the perfect formula to make your girlfriend feel special? Then think again. If you want to keep making her feel special, then you have to keep mixing things up and make your relationship feel fresh. Even if you've found the perfect date night scenario, you have to keep trying new combinations so your girlfriend doesn't feel like you're getting bored and complacent. Here are some great ways to keep things spontaneous:\n\n\nPlan a surprise trip or date when she doesn't expect it.\nWrite her a sweet love note on a random Tuesday.\nSerenade her in public.\nSend her a text message that makes her laugh in the middle of a stressful day.\nDon't be afraid to act like a little kid sometimes. If you feel like running around a park or jumping into the ocean, go for it! (As long as you're staying safe.)",
                "Find something new to do together. Though finding a routine that works for your relationship is great, you can also make your girlfriend feel special by continuing to find new activities that can define and reinvent your relationship. Here are some great things you can do together:\n\n\nStart a book club for two\nTake a dancing class\nLearn to cook one new recipe a month together\nTeach yourselves a foreign language\nTrain for a half-marathon together\nVolunteer in your community together",
                "Explore new places. Another great way to make your girlfriend feel special is to check out some new places together. You don't have to have the budget of a sultan to explore something new together. You can start by checking out a new restaurant, and then work your way up to going to a museum you've both had your sights on, and then take weekend trips to other cities or even plan an exciting vacation to get out of your usual routines. Make an effort to travel together as much as you can and you'll see that your girlfriend feels special because you continue making an effort.\n\n\nMake a dream bucket list of places that the two of you want to go to. Cross them off together, one by one, even if it takes years!",
                "Always make time for each other. Another way to make your girlfriend feel special is to always make her feel like she's a priority. That means that you should always make time for date nights, for conversation, and just for decompressing together. Once you stop making time for each other, the love and fun will stop, too.\n\n\nIf both or one of you is having a really busy week or month, talk about making that sacred couple time in advance.\nWhen you are together, give her your full attention. Don't check your phone, zone out, or invite other friends to join you if you're really trying to connect with your girl.",
                "Never take her for granted. Don't take her for granted and think that things are going great in your relationship so you don't have to keep trying so hard. A relationship is never either \"great\" or \"not great,\" and you need to always keep working on it, even if you feel like everything is perfect. Always remember to compliment your girlfriend, to tell her how special she is, and just to keep the love going no matter what.\n\n\nWhen you see her, notice her appearance and compliment her. Don't make her think you don't pay attention to her looks any more.\nContinue to check in and ask her about how her day, her job, her classes, etc, are going. Don't just assume that she'll bring it up if something is bothering her.\nCheck in about her feelings. Make sure she's happy and talk about it if she's not.",
                "Keep the romance alive. If you want to make your girlfriend feel special, then you have to keep things romantic, whether you've been together for five months or five years. Dress up for date nights. Always be a gentleman. Light some candles when you're cooking dinner for her. Keep the chase going -- play hard to get sometimes. Don't just settle in to your relationship once it's obvious that you both like each other, but work to keep her hooked and make her do the same.\n\n\nKeep the romance alive by trying new things, being adventurous together, and always having something to look forward to as a couple. If there's something romantic or sexy on the horizon, then your girlfriend will always feel special in her relationship, and you will always feel satisfied."

        "wikiHow to Detox Your Colon": {
            "intro": "Some natural health practitioners recommend a periodic colon cleanse, which may remove toxins from your digestive system.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid certain foods. The best way to start detoxing your colon is to eliminate the foods that are causing problems. Start to eliminate all the foods that are a burden to your liver and your colon. This includes coffee, white sugar, white flour, dairy, and alcohol.\n\n\nStop eating processed sweets, which are full of white sugar and flour. Also avoid excess amounts of cheese or ice cream.[1][2]",
                "Eat foods that help your body detox. There are certain foods that will help you detox your body. These include vegetables in the Brassica family, such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. These vegetables contain many nutrients and specific complexes called sulforaphanes that are very important in helping your body detox. [3][4]\n\nAlso make sure to eat plenty of fiber, because fiber-rich foods scrub the walls of the colon and push food through the intestines quickly. Some great high-fiber foods are green vegetables, apples, berries, and brown rice.[5][6][7]\n\nHigh fiber consumption can improve colon health by helping remnants inside the colon pass through.",
                "Eliminate all food allergies and intolerances. If you have never been tested for food intolerances, you may want to visit a doctor or natural doctor to have this done. Eating foods that your body has an intolerance to slows down colon functioning and increases the likelihood of bowel toxicity.",
                "Eat foods rich in chlorophyll to reduce toxins. There are certain foods that will help reduce the toxins in your blood. Studies have shown that chlorophyll reduces the absorption of toxins and helps with toxin excretion. Dark, leafy greens are very high in chlorophyll. Increase your intake of spinach, kale, collard greens, parsley, wheatgrass and seaweed.[8][9][10]\n\nTry incorporating these into every meal. Add your eggs to a bed of steamed kale or throw some spinach and wheatgrass in a smoothie. You can also buy dried seaweed chips as a snack.",
                "Take probiotics. Probiotics are good for overall colon health and also specifically help with detoxification. Probiotics decrease an enzyme in your body that causes your colon to hold onto toxins instead of excreting them. While it is a good idea to take a probiotic capsule every day for general health, you may want to take one to two extra probiotic capsules per day during a colon cleanse.[11][12]\n\nYou can also get probiotics through yogurt and other foods as well.",
                "Drink more water: Your body needs lots of water to help flush toxins. Most people should drink half their body weight in ounces per day for optimal bowel health. This means that, for example, you weigh 140 pounds, you need to drink 70 ounces of water per day, especially if you want to increase your colon health.[13]\n\nThis may seem like a lot of water, but if you incorporate a glass or two every few hours, it won't seem like so much. Don't try to drink it all at once. This can make you very sick.\nIt is especially important to increase water intake when increasing fiber intake or taking a fiber supplement. The added fiber in the diet needs added water consumption in order to digest properly.",
                "Ask your doctor. There are many colon-cleansing supplements on the market today. Some are designed to help to flush the colon of impurities, while others are made to support your organs in the act of detoxification. Before you take any of these supplements, you should consult with your doctor to make sure these products are safe for you.",
                "Use laxatives. Laxatives are products that stimulate your colon to work faster and to empty its contents. Take great caution with laxatives, because they can cause uncomfortable cramping and diarrhea if taken in high doses. They can also cause other side effects such as belching, bloating, gas, or stomach cramps. Try brands such as Milk of Magnesia, Miralax, or Dulcolax.\n\n\nIf you use laxatives on a long-term basis, your colon will actually become dependent on them, so make sure to use them only for a few days a time.[14]\n\nIf you want a more natural laxative, a gentle laxative tea is usually sufficient during a colon cleanse. Step one to two tea bags of Yogi Tea Soothing Mint Get Regular Tea in hot water for five to 10 minutes. Drink the tea at night. Six to eight hours later you should have a normal bowel movement.[15]",
                "Take fiber supplements. In addition to fiber-rich foods, supplements that contain fiber bind toxins and help the colon excrete them. Add two tablespoons per day of rice bran, psyllium, or oat bran fiber. An easy way to consume fiber is to add it directly to smoothies or oatmeal.\n\n\nMake sure to drink lots of water when you are adding fiber supplements. Otherwise, fiber can cause constipation or intestinal obstruction.\nYou can also take dissolvable fiber supplements, such as Benefiber and Metamucil.[16]",
                "Consider magnesium. Magnesium gently draws water into your colon and has a natural laxative effect. Unlike herbal or over-the-counter laxatives, magnesium is non-addicting and will not cause dependence when used long-term.\n\n\nTake 300 to 600 mg of magnesium citrate per day. Make sure not to exceed 900 mg per day because excessive magnesium can cause health issues.\nYou can also buy liquid magnesium citrate and drink it instead of using a supplement. Make sure the amount in the drink does not exceed 900 mg of magnesium a day.[17]",
                "Ask about N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a precursor to glutathione, which is one of the major detoxifying substances in the body. It is found in many natural foods such as some yogurt and protein rich poultry, but it can also be taken as a supplement when you are detoxing your colon. When you supplement with NAC, your body turns it into glutathione that can be used to help you detox more quickly and effectively.\n\n\nTake 500 to 1500mg of NAC per day in capsule form during a cleanse. You can buy these supplements in health stores or pharmacies.",
                "Use castor oil packs. Castor oil packs aid in the elimination and detoxification of the colon. Get a flannel cloth, which can be cotton or wool, plastic saran wrap, a bath towel, a hot water bottle or heating pad, and castor oil. Pour oil onto the flannel until it is well moistened. Lie down, placing the flannel directly onto your abdomen. Place plastic wrap over all sides of the flannel to prevent staining of your clothes or bedding. Wrap the towel around your torso over the plastic. Then apply the hot water bottle or heating pad (set to medium) over the towel. Rest for 10-30 minutes. Remove the flannel and clean your abdomen. You may reuse the flannel without washing it for approximately 3 weeks. [18]",
                "Try an enema. Enemas can be used to help with bowel cleansing during a detox program. When you do an enema, you inject fluid into your colon in order to stimulate a bowel movement and help flush the colon of impurities.\n\n\nLike laxatives, enemas can cause dependence if used too frequently, but they are safe and effective when performed properly during a short-term cleanse.[19][20]",
                "See a natural doctor. Natural doctors, like naturopaths, are trained in how to safely and properly detoxify their patients. A naturopath can look at your medical history as well as you medications and decide what kind of detox protocol would be best for you. They can tell you how often you should get colonics, and they can also prescribe herbs, supplements, and home treatments to help your body detox safely and naturally.",
                "Consider a colonic. Colon therapists perform colonics, or colon irrigation procedures, at their offices each day. Colonics can be somewhat uncomfortable, but they can be very effective in detoxifying the colon. Make sure you go to a colon therapist who is trained in practicing safe and sanitary procedures.",
                "Ask your doctor about the procedure. If you are having colon issues, ask your doctor about a colonic and what to expect. During a colonic the colon therapist gently inserts a tube in your rectum. The tube is attached to a pump that forces water or some other liquid into your large intestine. After your colon is saturated, the therapist removes the first tube and carefully inserts a new tube. The therapist will massage your abdomen to expel the water and waste from your colon.\n\n\nThe therapist may repeat the process to fully cleanse the bowels. Up to 16 gallons of water can be pumped and expelled during this procedure.\nSubsequent procedures may involve water treated with probiotics, herbs, or coffee, which help extract things from your colon.[21]",
                "Make sure you have at least one bowel movement per day. The longer that stool stays in your colon, the more time your body has to re-absorb toxins. Many of the changes listed above should help you to have a daily bowel movement if this is not happening for you currently.\n\n\nIf you have improved your diet and tried other options to help and are still not going once a day, it is a good idea for you to visit your doctor for further evaluation and advice.\nIf you are having more than 2 bowel movements per day or your bowel movements are loose, consider consulting with a doctor before proceeding."

        "How to Know if You Like Someone or if You're Just Lonely": {
            "intro": "New relationships bring up a lot of questions: “Is this going anywhere?” “Do they really like me?” “Do I really like them?” Answering these questions sincerely can help you avoid heartache down the line, and prevent you from dragging someone else down with your emotional baggage. If you’re even the slightest bit unsure of whether you truly like someone or if you’re just seeing them to avoid loneliness, you need to back off for a bit. Find out for sure how you feel about this person by closely examining the relationship and filling your time with other activities besides the relationship. Finally, learn how to dodge a rebound relationship..",
            "steps": [
                "Know the typical signs of a serious attraction. If you’re not convinced you’re really into someone, it’s good to know the usual indicator of a strong attraction. In general, when you really like another person, you seem to think about them all the time, even when you’re not with them. You can’t wait to learn all about them.\n\n\nYou’re excited to introduce them to your friends. The hot girl/guy in the apartment across the hall no longer catches your interest. You feel like you’re invincible.[1]\n\nIf you don’t feel overly excited about the prospect of seeing this other person and getting to know more about them, chances are, you could be just using them to fill a void.",
                "Ask for some space. A great way to get to the bottom about your feelings is to take a break from the relationship. Getting some time apart can help you reflect on your attraction for the person and decide how you feel when they’re not around.\n\n\nYou don’t have to come out and tell the person why you need space. But, you can say, “We’re moving really fast and I want to slow it down. Can you give me the week/weekend to think?”",
                "Identify what you like about this person. Spend some time reflecting on what attracted you to your partner. Sit down and make a list. Review your list for any red flag that point to this person being a solution for your loneliness.[2]\n\nFor example, does your list describe their quirky personality, honesty, and ambition, which are healthy traits to desire in a partner? Or, do you simply like that they are always available when you call?\nOther examples might be that this person is attractive and makes you look good in front of your friends. Maybe you don't care about them beyond the fact that they symbolize your ability to find an attractive mate.",
                "Question whether anyone could fill their void. Now for the moment of truth: ask yourself if there is something truly unique about the other person that attracts you. Reflect on this as you get space from the relationship. What are they providing that is special and different from what you get from others?[3]\n\nCan someone else fulfill their purpose? For example, are you glad to have someone to go out with on weekends? Pretty much anyone can give you that. If that’s all you value about the other person, you could be unknowingly using them to avoid loneliness.",
                "Make new friends. A great way to diagnose loneliness is to treat it. Spend time with other people besides your significant other. Fill your social calendar with fun activities and gatherings. Join a club or organization to meet people with common interests. Take a cooking or dance class. Ask a coworker or acquaintance out to lunch or coffee.[4]\n\nOther ways to find friends might be reach out to old connections through social media. Strike up a conversation with someone in your favorite shop or boutique. Join a meetup to connect with people who have the same hobbies as you.\nIf, in the midst of your increased social activity, you don’t find yourself missing the other person or wishing they could join you, there’s a chance you were just lonely.",
                "Volunteer. Another terrific way to socialize is through volunteerism. It helps you connect with people and make a difference in your local community. Offer to visit a nursing or retirement home and help with craft time. Dedicate a few hours a week to the local homeless or animal shelter. Or, simply offer to babysit your neighbor’s kids each Thursday so that they can have a standing date night.\n\n\nGiving back to others offers a load of benefits such as enhancing self-esteem and fighting loneliness. If you find that you no longer think about your partner due to your new obligations, odds are you just needed to get out more.[5]",
                "Develop hobbies outside of the relationship. Does your relationship consist of you doing all the activities that your partner enjoys? If so, you can help clarify your feelings by pursuing your own passions. These passions may help you feel more satisfied in life. As a result, you may find that you don’t like this person as much as you thought.[6]\n\nTake up a new fitness class at a nearby gym. Learn a new language. Bake more often. Go fishing. Just do things that you like.",
                "Set personal goals. Feeling unfulfilled in other areas of life can lead you to jump into a relationship prematurely. Take some time to work on yourself. As you start focusing on your future by goal-setting, determine if the other person factors into the picture.[7]\n\nThink about something that you have been wanting to do for you. Maybe that includes getting more training in your chosen career or planning to travel abroad. If you consider that person’s role in your future, then there’s a chance you see them as more than just a placeholder.",
                "Wait until you have grieved past relationships before moving on. You may not be sure that you like this person because you entered the relationship shortly after ending another. This is a classic mistake, and can undermine your ability to form a healthy relationship with this person. Avoid jumping into a new relationship too quickly. Wait until you have completely resolved your feelings for your ex.\n\n\nMaybe you got dumped and wanted to save face by quickly finding a new love. Or, maybe you’ve been divorced for some time and everyone keeps asking when you will start dating again—but you’re not quite over your ex. These aren’t good reasons to start a new relationship.[8]",
                "Take new relationships slowly. If you have gotten hot and heavy with this new person over a span of days or weeks, you could be using the new relationship to cover up unresolved problems. A healthy relationship progresses at a moderate pace in which both people steadily become more affectionate. If you swear you are in love after a week, you could be rebounding to prevent loneliness.[9]",
                "Learn how to be single. A major reason many people get into rebound relationships is because they fear being single. In truth, there are numerous upsides to being single like getting to know yourself, focusing on building a meaningful career, and spreading your love among family and friends. Don’t fall for the misconception that being alone equals being lonely.[10]\n\nBeing single can be enjoyable when you build your social network with supportive friends and family. Plus, you can learn to be single by directing your attention on improving yourself. Go back to school. Clean up your diet. Set objective goals. Don’t assign your value based on your relationship status.",
                "Work on your self-esteem. If your self-confidence is wrapped up in your identity of being half of a whole, you may need to work on that. Feeling less-than because you are single could contribute to you entering a toxic relationship just to feel the void. If you improve your self-esteem, you can overcome loneliness and make yourself a better candidate for the right mate when they come along.[11]\n\nRecognize your positive qualities that have nothing to do with your relationship status. Write them down and hang them on your bathroom mirror as a reminder.\nImprove your self-talk. Don’t call yourself a “loser” because you’re at home on a Saturday night. Either make plans with a friend or remind yourself that your value isn’t in your social calendar.",
                "See a therapist for codependency issues. Codependent people are basically obsessed with caring for others, even at the sake of their own health and well-being. If you have a type in relationships, always dating someone who always needs help or care-taking, you may need to work with a professional.[12]\n\nCodependency can make you feel empty if you don’t have someone to care for. Therefore, you refuse to be alone and find a new relationship even if you aren’t actually in love with the person. If this sounds like you, ask your doctor about getting a referral to a mental health therapist who can help you get to the root of this problem."

        "wikiHow to Maintain a Healthy Diet at School (Teens)": {
            "intro": "Maintaining a healthy weight at school requires a healthy and balanced diet. It’s also important that you maintain healthy eating habits so you can have enough energy during the school day.",
            "steps": [
                "Eat breakfast every day before school. Go for yogurt with fresh fruit like strawberries or blueberries and granola, or a bowl of wholegrain breakfast cereal that is low in sugar with low-fat milk. Starting the morning off with a meal also signals the metabolism to rev-up, creating a calorie-burning, fat-burning environment for the rest of the day. Remember that what you eat at breakfast will impact your cravings for the rest of the day. Choose proteins, whole grains and healthy fats.\n\n\nYou can also have eggs and multigrain toast or a breakfast smoothie with a frozen banana, berries, water or coconut milk, and honey.",
                "Pack a full water bottle. Sugary soft drinks and sodas will only lead to a temporary sugar high and a poor diet. Substitute sodas and fruit juices with a water bottle full of filtered water. Add a slice of lemon, lime, cucumber, or orange for all natural flavor. Put the full water bottle in your school bag so you have it ready when you’re thirsty at school.[1]",
                "Put healthy snacks in your school bag. Wrap an apple and a banana in a paper bag and put it in your backpack in the morning, or put a few sugar free granola bars in your bag. This way, when you’re hungry between periods you have healthy snacks rather than processed snacks from the vending machine.[2]\n\nFocus on foods that do not need to be kept cool. Sometimes a cold pack can be used, but to eliminate the chance of food-borne illness, choose foods that are shelf-stable and can easily be carried around throughout the day.\nYou can also prepare healthy snacks the night before by cutting up fresh fruit and packing it in tupperware, or putting trail mix in ziploc bags. Stash them by the front door so you can grab them in the morning or pack them in your school bag.",
                "Create a meal schedule. Spend some time planning out your meals with a parent or guardian to ensure you have three meals a day, every day. Focus on lunch meals that are easy to transport, pack well, and are filling, but still healthy.[3][4]\n\nGet a dry erase board or use a word processing program to make a grid for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Then, write the days of the week that you go to school, usually Monday-Friday.\nWork with a parent to come up with basic meals for a quick breakfast, a healthy and easy to carry lunch, and a filling dinner.\nYou can also use an app on your phone like ZipList, Evernote, and Pepper Plate to create a meal schedule and a shopping list for the grocery store.[5]",
                "Pack your lunch the night before. Making your lunch the night before should be part of your routine, and shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes. If a parent usually packs your lunch, get involved and help him organize the meal and put it in containers or resealable bags.\n\n\nUse leftover food from dinner or from a big batch of prepared food in a different ways, such as leftover BBQ chicken in a wrap or leftover vegetables on whole wheat pasta.",
                "Go for healthy options if you leave campus for lunch. Choose restaurants with quick and healthy options. Avoid most fast food restaurants or choose the healthier item if you find yourself at one. Choose salads, wraps, or deli sandwiches.\n\n\nIf your friends have a soft spot for fast food, look for the healthier food choices on the menu, like the vegetarian option or a sandwich with a side of salad instead of french fries.",
                "Don’t skip a meal. Skipping meals signals the metabolism to slow down and burn fewer calories. This is not ideal during a long day of sitting in a classroom. The ideal situation would be to signal the body to ramp up the metabolism and keep it high with healthy, timely snacks throughout the day.",
                "Ask your parents if you can help with the cooking. Get involved in preparing food and working with your parents in the kitchen. Learn how to cut vegetables properly and how to treat raw food. Ask you parents questions about cooking and preparing food so you can practice your cooking skills.[6]\n\nAs you help prepare meals, think about healthier ways to make certain dishes. For example, baking or steaming fish instead of frying it, or replacing red meat with other protein options like baked tofu.\nHelping to cook meals will also allow you to control the portion size on the plates. Limiting your portion sizes to no more than a handful of each dish or type of food will ensure you do not overeat.",
                "Look for fruit and vegetable options. As of 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued new standards for school lunches, which increased the amount of fruits and vegetables served, emphasized whole grain foods, allowed only low fat and nonfat milk, and reduced saturated fats and sodium. By law, your school should offer a daily serving of fruits and vegetables, fresh or in a fruit or veggie cup without added sugar.[7][8]\n\nIf your school offers fruit juices as a beverage, they must be 100% juice, with no added sugar. They may also offer dried fruit options.\nThere should be vegetables available in the form of dark leafy greens like broccoli, or spinach, red or orange veggies like carrots or sweet potatoes, and beans or peas like kidney beans or lentils.\nIf starchy foods like corn or white potatoes are served, there should be no added salt. Beans and peas may also be offered as meat alternatives for vegetarian eaters.",
                "Remember that most quick, fast options are laden with salt, sugar and fat. It is possible to find healthy options in schools, but the best option is always packing a balanced lunch. According to a report by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, the five worst meals you can eat at school are:[9]\n\nBeef and cheese nachos, which contain 24 grams of fat and almost 1,500 milligrams of sodium\nMeatloaf and potatoes, which contain 72 calories and 78 milligrams of cholesterol\nCheeseburgers, which have more saturated fat than a child should consume in an entire meal\nCheese sandwiches such as grilled cheese sandwiches and cheese quesadillas, which contain more than 7 grams of saturated fat and almost 1,000 milligrams of sodium\nPepperoni pizza, which contains more than 6 grams of saturated fat; pepperoni is a processed meat that increases cancer risk",
                "Load up on grains. Schools in the U.S. are required to serve whole grain options for lunch every school day. These include rice, quinoa, and/or couscous. Look for these healthier grain options in place of carb-heavy foods like bread or pasta.[10]\n\nSchools are also required to offer meat alternative foods, like tofu or soy yogurt, which can be a good way to get protein without loading up on red meat.",
                "Look for healthier drink options. There should be 100% fruit juice available at your school during lunch time, as well as milk options like fat-free or low-fat, with no added sugars or flavors. Your school should offer at least two types of milk, as well as fruit juices.[11]\n\nTry to avoid sugary drinks like soda or fruit juices with added sugar from the vending machines at school.",
                "Limit your portions. Portion control is an important way to maintain a healthy diet at school and to ensure you are getting all the nutrients and energy you need for the day. Divide your plate into four sections, with dairy (in the form of fat-free or low-fat milk) on the side. Your plate should be balanced with four types of food: fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein like meat, beans, or tofu.[12]\n\nYou should have about one cup of grains like rice or pasta, and one cup of vegetables and fruits. Clench your fist and place it over your plate. These portions should be no bigger than your clenched fist.\nThe meat or protein portion should be about as big as your palm.\nAdded fats like butter, mayo, or salad dressing should be the size of the top of your thumb.\nNone of your food should overlap or be piled high. There should be a small amount of space between each of the four food groups."

        "How to Set up a Reward System for Children": {
            "intro": "A reward system for children can be a great way to change or encourage specific behaviors. As a parent or guardian, you should be prepared to explain the correct behavior to your child, and to consistently provide the promised reward.",
            "steps": [
                "Make a chart. A chart is an easy way for both you and your child to track progress. Place the chart in an area where the child will see it often, such as the refrigerator or in the child's room. Every time your child succeeds, draw or stick a star onto the chart next to his name. Mark milestones on the chart, where the child gets a special reward for reaching that point.",
                "Consider a calendar. This may be more appropriate for a child 12 years old or older, who may be able to focus on longer-term behavioral goals. For example, the child can mark the calendar with an \"X\" every day he completes homework without being told to do so. Give the child the reward after a complete week has been marked, or based on the number of \"X\"s before a certain deadline.\n\n\nIf you want to reward chores, mark them on the calendar with a check box next to them.",
                "Add a timer for sensitive chores. Use a timer or a clock to time your child in completing a task such as picking up toys or completing chores. This can help with children who keep putting off tasks. The child only earns the reward if he or she completes the task before the deadline.",
                "Select behaviors you'd like to influence. Decide on the specific behaviors you want to change or encourage in your child. These can be negative habits you want to discourage, such as lying or leaving toys on the floor, or positive habits you'd like to encourage, such as following a bedtime routine. Consider starting with just one or two behaviors, while your child is getting used to the system.",
                "Choose rewards. Choose rewards based on the child's age and what the child wants. Here are a few ideas:\n\n\nA child under the age of six may respond to a reward of stars placed on a chart next to his name.\nFor small chores, offer candy, or a short TV or computer session.\nFor big achievements or prolonged good behavior, offer to buy a toy or go on a day trip.\nSome children respond best to privileges, such as getting to stay up late or go to a sleepover.",
                "Ask the kids what they want. Let the kids give feedback on what chores they'd like to do and what rewards they'd like to earn. Make it clear that the final call is up to you, but listen to what they have to say. They'll do more work if they're excited about the rewards.\n\n\nIf the kids can't agree on a fair way to split the chores, roll dice to divide the chores. Change it every month so no one gets stuck too long with bad luck.",
                "Consider a trade-in system. Older children may appreciate having more choice. Let them earn tokens, and make several prizes available that the child can get by trading in tokens.\n\n\nYou can use Monopoly money as tokens.",
                "Explain the reward system. Explain the correct behavior (what to do and what not to do) so that your child understands what you want. Be very clear about how the child earns rewards, and explain that there won't be any rewards if the behavior doesn't happen.\n\n\nMake it clear when the child will receive the reward. Does the child get a treat as soon as the chore is done, or as a dessert after dinner that night?",
                "Be consistent. For a behavior reward system to work, you must be consistent. Issue the reward every time your child earns it. Do this right away or make it very clear when the reward will happen. Similarly, do not give your child the reward if he has not earned it. If you aren't consistent, the child may lose trust in the system and refuse to cooperate.\n\n\nIf you want to give your child an extra treat for a different reason, choose a reward he can't get with this system.",
                "Make it a routine. Kids work better with routines and predictable systems. Keep the chart or calendar in a visible location, and remind the kids of the tasks at the same time every day. If you establish a consistent routine, you will give your child a goal to work toward.",
                "Don't force non-urgent behavior. The reward system is supposed to motivate the child to change her behavior on her own. Unless something absolutely must get done, don't force your child to complete the task. Remind her of the task and the reward as many times as you think appropriate, but then let her make the decision on her own.\n\n\nIf she doesn't change her behavior at all, you may need to try different rewards or a different system.",
                "Praise the kids before a reward. Make sure you give plenty of praise when your child earns a reward. Start by thanking or praising the child, then give the reward. This helps reinforce the intrinsic value of the good behavior, instead of making it only about personal benefit.",
                "Don't tie punishment to the reward system. The \"punishment\" in the rewards system is not getting a reward. Leave more severe punishments for extra-bad behavior, not failing to get a star on the reward chart. If the child forms negative associations with the reward system, he may stop cooperating.",
                "When your child asks for a treat, remind her of the system. If your child asks for a toy but hasn't earned it, remind her that she didn't earn a reward.\n\n\nIf your child tries to get a promise out of you (\"If I do this will you get me that?\"), just remind her how the system works. Say \"Do you think you can earn a reward this week? You tell me.\" A direct promise can undermine the reward system and make it about trying to manipulate you directly.",
                "Add a little competition. Competition can be a fun motivator, but it can also lead to jealousy or fighting. Start with little surprises, like \"first person in the car gets the front seat on the next trip.\" If your kids are mature enough to handle it, you can consider a bonus reward that you give to the best-behaved kid each week.\n\n\nIt might not be fair to have children of different ages compete.",
                "Consider changes as you try it out. If the child has mastered a behavior, consider gradually reducing its rewards and adding new behaviors to encourage. If the child is excited about the system, add harder tasks with better rewards.\n\n\nRemember to stay as consistent as possible. Your child may rebel against the system if he suddenly can't get the usual reward."

        "How to Fix a Slow Toilet": {
            "intro": "Do you have a slow-flowing or flushing toilet? This can be caused by a variety of issues, though many of them can be fixed without calling a plumber. You’ll want to start by checking the tank, as this is the simplest cause. Otherwise, you may need to clean the toilet rim with household products. For toilets with serious deposits, you might even need to use muriatic, or hydrochloric acid.",
            "steps": [
                "Find the source of the problem. “Slow toilet” can mean one of two things. Either the bowl isn’t filling quickly, or it isn’t draining quickly. If you’re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You’ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn’t filling quickly enough, you might only need to check the tank.",
                "Lift the tank cover. The tank is the upright portion of the toilet, where you find the flushing handle. Lay the tank cover on the floor carefully; the heavy porcelain can potentially damage your floors.",
                "Check the chain connecting the flushing handle to the flapper. The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn’t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle.[1]\n\nThe chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used.",
                "Adjust the chain if needed. Performing this adjustment is rather simple. The chain should run through a hole in the flushing handle. You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain’s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack.[2]\n\nAdjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet’s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe.",
                "Pour a gallon of hot water into the toilet. Use a bucket to pour the water into the bowl. The hot water will help dislodge the residue that might be slowing the flow of water out of the bowl.[3] Let the hot water sit in the toilet, don’t flush it.",
                "Pour drain cleaner into the toilet. Make sure to use a product suitable for a toilet. The product you choose should have instructions detailing the amount you should be using.\n\n\nMake sure to read the label carefully. Some products aren’t meant for use on ceramics, and may require that you use protective equipment.\nAlways follow the instructions listed on the product. Some drain cleaner may require immediate flushing, whereas others need time to work before being flushed.",
                "Put dishwashing liquid in the overflow pipe. You can find this upright pipe in the toilet’s tank. It will usually have a small tube running into it.[4] You should put a small amount of dishwashing liquid in, only about a tablespoon.",
                "Let the toilet sit for 10 minutes. This will give the dishwashing liquid time to seep down the overflow pipe. Additionally, the calcium and other deposits will slowly dislodge from the toilet’s walls, making for an easy clean.",
                "Flush the toilet. This will send water through the tank’s pipes, and out through the holes below the toilet rim. The dishwashing liquid will dislodge any residue in the tank. The drain cleaner will remove any clogs or mineral deposits in the drain, improving the toilet’s flow.[5]",
                "Take the necessary safety precautions. Make sure to wear gloves, mask and eye protection. You should also wear an apron and rubber boots to protect yourself.\n\n\nYou should maximize ventilation by placing a running fan in the bathroom window to exhaust air. If you have a bathroom exhaust fan, turn that on too.",
                "Turn off the water to the toilet and flush. Use a sponge to remove the water left in bowl. This will ensure the acid will clean the bowl to the bottom, including the critical jet-hole. This is a smaller hole at the bottom of the toilet bowl; water is pushed out of it forcefully to help the toilet flush. You’ll see it in action at the end of a flush, and buildup here may be responsible for a slow flush.",
                "Take off the tank cover and insert a plastic funnel into the overflow tube. If there is a fill tube on top of the overflow tube, carefully take that off first. The funnel’s opening should be as large as possible, to facilitate pouring, but fit snugly in the overflow tube.\n\n\nMake sure not to use a metal funnel; the acid will corrode it.\nRinse the funnel well after use and do not reuse it for food.",
                "Carefully pour muriatic acid through the funnel. You should only pour a few ounces of acid into the tube.[6] You should pour fast enough that it begins to flow out of the holes in the toilet bowl rim but not so fast that the funnel overflows or falls out, as this would splash acid and be extremely dangerous.\n\n\nPour the rest of the gallon into the toilet bowl; this will help clear the drain.",
                "Tape a clear piece of poly-film over the toilet bowl and tank opening. The tighter the seal the better. Just cover the bowl portion, do not include the seat. This will keep the acid’s fumes from filling the bathroom.[7]\n\nAlternatively you can use a clear trash bag to cover the toilet bowl.",
                "Let the acid sit in the toilet for 24 hours. If there are children or pets in your home, make sure the door to the bathroom is closed and locked. The acid will dislodge mineral deposits in the toilet bowl and the drain over time.[8]",
                "Remove the poly-film and flush a few times. You’ll have to make sure to turn on the water first. Extra flushes are advisable in older homes with iron drain pipes, as prolonged contact with concentrated acid will damage them.",
                "Check the rim holes for proper flow. You can find these holes under the toilet rim. They propel water to fill the bowl whenever you flush. Make sure that water flows freely from these holes whenever you flush. You can also use a coat hanger to check the holes for obstructions and other build ups.\n\n\nRepeat the procedure if necessary."

It includes the facts of the case, the legal issues to be determined, and references to applicable statutes (written law) and prior cases similar to yours. The brief is an attempt to convince the judge that your view of the case is the correct way to resolve the issues. How you format the brief will depend on the particular court hearing your case. If the brief isn't formatted correctly, the court may refuse to accept it. This article will guide you through the basics of properly formatting a legal brief.",
            "steps": [
                "Base your brief preparation on the particular court that’s hearing your case. This will determine the requirements for how you’ll compose your brief. Your case will either be in federal or state court.\n\n\nThe federal court system encompasses Federal District Courts, Federal Courts of Appeal, and the United States Supreme Court.\nState court systems usually have trial courts (sometimes called Superior Courts or Circuit Courts), appellate courts, and the state supreme court.[1]",
                "Establish the reason for the brief. Briefs are normally either trial briefs or appellate briefs. There will probably be different rules governing each, so the necessary elements of the brief will depend on whether you’re using it for a trial or an appeal.\n\n\nA trial brief is provided to a judge as a written presentation of the facts and law that you feel backs up your argument as to why you should win your case. (In a trial, if you're the person who started the lawsuit you're known as the \"plaintiff\". If you're the one being sued, you're called the \"defendant\".)[2]\n\nAn appellate brief comes into play primarily when someone has lost a trial, and wants a higher court to overturn (reverse) the decision. (This is known as an “appeal”.) The purpose of the appellate brief is:\n\nTo convince the higher court that the trial court’s decision was wrong (if you’re the person—known as the “appellant” or \"petitioner\"—who lost the case and is appealing the decision), or\nTo defend the trial court’s decision (if you’re the person—known as the “appellee” or \"respondent\"—who won the trial).[3]",
                "Find and follow the court rules. Whether you’re in federal court or state court, there are rules of procedure that control how a brief should be written. You’ll need to follow these rules very carefully to ensure that your brief is acceptable to the court.\n\n\nFederal courts usually have a website that will give you access to the court rules. For example, the rules governing federal appellate briefs can be found here.\nMany state courts have websites. Some may have their procedural rules posted online. If your state doesn’t provide this service, then you’ll have to check legal research sites online (some of which you may have to pay for), or go to a law library to find the rules. Most courthouses have law libraries that are open to the public.",
                "Make a list of the important facts in your case. This amounts to setting down the sequence of events that led to your case being in court. The facts of a particular case are what dictate which laws a court will need to apply to make a decision.",
                "Determine the legal points you need to address. You have to identify the legal point (issue) in your case that you believe needs to be resolved. For example, you signed a contract to sell your house. But now the buyer wants to back out of the deal because the house has termites. The legal point you want to address is whether the law permits the buyer to avoid going through with the contract under these circumstances.[4] Some other common issues you may encounter are:\n\n\nA neighbor’s responsibility if a tree limb, hanging over your property from his or her yard, falls and damages your house\nWhether a landlord who’s trying to evict you for non-payment of rent is obligated to accept your offer to pay the overdue amount\nA municipality’s liability for damage to your car caused by an unrepaired pothole.",
                "Research the law. Once you know the legal points you need to deal with, you have to find the law that applies to these issues. You’ll require access to federal or state statutes, and legal cases that are similar to yours. You can find statutes (and some case law) here, as well as on your state’s official website. However, you may need more case law than is available on these sites.\n\n\nThere are online legal research services, but normally you have to pay to use them.\nThe alternative is to go to a law library, where you can research online or by using the law books available there. Law librarians can help you find the research tools you need, but doing the actual research is up to you.",
                "Compile a list of the legal cases and statutes you plan to use. Whenever you find a legal source that you believe supports your argument, you’ll have to note its citation (its name and the legal book it’s located in) to use it in your brief. You’ll also need the page number (for case law) or the section number (for a statute) of any portion of the legal source that you want to quote in your brief. Your best bet is simply to print the case or statute so you have it readily available.",
                "Follow the court rules regarding formatting requirements. Each court’s procedural rules will tell you what kind of formatting is needed. However, some of the more standard features are:\n\n\nPaper: opaque and unglazed\nLine spacing: double-spaced for standard text; single-spaced for quotations, headings and footnotes\nPaper size: 8.5” x 11”\nMargins: one inch all around\nType size: 12 point, usually Times New Roman, Arial, or Courier (The Supreme Court of The United States requires a font from the Century family)\nSides of page available for text: One side only.[5]",
                "Prepare a Cover Page, Table of Contents, and Table of Authorities. These are the preliminary pages of the brief.\n\n\nThe Cover Page is where you’ll list the court name, the names of the parties involved in the case, the court case number (usually known as a \"docket number\"), the type of brief (trial or appellate), your status (plaintiff or defendant; appellant or appellee), and your name, address, and contact information.\nThe Table of Contents is pretty much what you’d expect. It breaks down the various sections of the brief, and indicates the page on which each section begins.\nThe Table of Authorities is where you list the legal sources you’re referring to in your brief, such as statutes and case law citations.[6]\n\nYou can find an example of a Cover Page, Table of Contents, and Table of Authorities here.",
                "Compose the body of the brief. This is the actual heart of the brief. Keep your sections concise and to the point. Some standard sections are:\n\n\nA Statement of Facts. This is where you’ll use the information you compiled in Part 2, Step 1, above. Lay out the facts in a logical order, basically leading from the beginning events of the case up to the time the case was filed in court.\nA Summary of the Argument. As the title implies, you’ll summarize how you believe the law applies to your circumstances.\nThe Argument. Here's where you’ll be able to expand on how the law applies to the facts of your case (such as by quoting prior cases similar to yours).\n\nUsually you’ll have the word “ARGUMENT” centered, in capital letters.\nBelow that, and single-spaced, you’ll indicate the legal point you’re making, in just a few lines.\nThe rest of the Argument section should be double-spaced, except for quotations (single-spaced).\n\n\nThe Conclusion. This section is typically very short. You basically tell the court what you’re asking it to do. For example, if you’re the appellant in a case, you’ll respectfully request that the appellate court reverse the decision of the trial court. The Conclusion section is also where you sign the brief.[7]",
                "Set your page numbering. This is known as “pagination”, and it can be a bit tricky in a brief. For example, some courts may want your preliminary pages to be numbered in lower case roman numerals, and the body of the brief to use standard numbering. Again, be guided by the court rules. You can learn more about pagination here.",
                "Consider hiring an attorney to represent you. Brief writing and formatting can be complicated, particularly on the appellate level. Even if you represented yourself at the trial, you might want to consider retaining an attorney to represent you on an appeal."

        "How to Start a Small Business": {
            "intro": "Starting a small business is without a doubt a large undertaking, but it is fortunately something that can be attained by anybody with a good idea, a strong work ethic, and a good set of resources. Starting a business involves thinking of a business concept, writing a business plan, understanding the financial side, and finally marketing and launching.",
            "steps": [
                "Define your goals. Do you want financial independence, eventually selling your business to the highest bidder? Do you want something small and sustainable, that you love doing and from which you want to derive a steady income? These are the things that are good to know very early on.",
                "Choose an idea. It might be a product you've always wanted to make, or a service you feel people need. It might even be something people don't know they need yet, because it hasn't been invented!\n\n\nIt can be helpful to have people who are bright and creative join you for a casual brainstorming session. Start with a simple question like: \"What shall we do?\" The idea is not to create a business plan, just to generate potential ideas. Many of the ideas will be duds, and there will be quite a few ordinary ones, but a few may emerge that have real potential.\nConsider your talents, experience, and knowledge when selecting a concept. If you have a particular skill set or talent, consider how these resources can be applied to meeting some sort of market demand. Combining skill and knowledge with a market demand increases your odds of having a successful business idea.\nFor example, you may have worked with electronics as an employee for many years. You may have noticed a demand in your community for a particular form of electrical work, and combining your experience with the market demand can allow you to attract customers.",
                "Create a working name. You could even do this before you have an idea for the business, and if the name is good, you may find it helps you define your business idea. As your plan grows, and things begin to take shape, the perfect name may come to you, but don't let that hinder you in the early phases. Create a name that you can use while you plan and don't hesitate to change it later.\n\n\nAlways check to see if the name is being used by somebody else before selecting it. Try to create a name that is simple and memorable.\nThink of popular brand names like \"Apple\". These names are memorable, simple, and easy to pronounce.",
                "Define your team. Will you do this alone, or will you bring in one or two trusted friends to join you? This brings a lot of synergy to the table, as people bounce ideas off each other. Two people together can often create something that is greater than the sum of the two separate parts.\n\n\nThink of some of the biggest success stories in recent times, such as John Lennon and Paul McCartney; Bill Gates and Paul Allen; Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak; and Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In every case, the partnership brought out the best in both sides of the equation.\nThink about the areas that you are either weak in, or have little knowledge of. Finding partners compatible with your personality who can fill in your knowledge or skill gaps is an excellent way to ensure your business has the resources you need to succeed.",
                "Choose your partners wisely. When choosing the person or people you're going to build the business with, be careful. Even if someone is your best friend, it doesn't mean that you will partner well in a business operation. Start it with a reliable person. Things to consider when choosing your co-leaders and support cast include:\n\n\nDoes the other person complement your weaknesses? Or do both of you bring only one set of the same skills to the table? If the latter, be wary as you can have too many people doing the same thing while other things are left unattended.\nDo you see eye to eye on the big picture? Arguments about the details are a given, and are important for getting things right. But not seeing eye to eye on the big picture, the real purpose of your business, can cause a split that may be irreparable. Be sure your team cares about the and buys into the purpose as much as you do.\nIf interviewing people, do some reading on how to spot real talent beyond the certifications, degrees or lack thereof. The area an individual is educated in is not necessarily the area they are most talented in. An interviewee may have a background in accounting for example, but their experience and your assessment of them indicates they may be a better fit helping with marketing.",
                "Create a business plan. A business plan helps to define what you think you need to launch your business, large or small. It summarizes the sense of your business in a single document. It also creates a map for investors, bankers, and other interested parties to use when determining how they can best help you and to help them decide whether or not your business is viable. Your business plan should consist of the elements outlined in the steps below.",
                "Write your business description. Describe your business more specifically, and how it fits into the market in general. If you are a corporation, LLC, or sole proprietorship, state that, and why you chose to go that route. Describe your product, its big features, and why people will want it. Answer the following questions:\n\n\nWho are potential customers? Once you understand who they are and what they want, come up with a marketing strategy.\n\nWhat price are they willing to pay for your product or service? Why would they pay for your product or service over your competitor's?\nWho are your competitors? Do a competitive analysis to identify key competitors. Find out who is doing something similar to what you are planning, and how have they been successful. Just as important is to find the failures, and what made their venture fall apart.",
                "Write an operational plan. This will describe how you will produce or deliver your product or service and all costs.\n\n\nHow will you create your product? Is it a service that you are offering, or if it's more complex— software, a physical product like a toy or a toaster — how will it get built? Define the process, from sourcing raw materials to assembly to completion, packaging, warehousing, and shipping. Will you need additional people? Will there be unions involved? All of these things must be taken into account.\nWho will lead, and who will follow? Define your organization, from the receptionist up to the CEO, and what part each plays in both function and financials. Knowing your organizational structure will better help you plan your operating costs, and fine-tune how much capital you will need to function effectively.\nGetting feedback. Friends and family make great resources for asking questions and getting feedback––don't hesitate to use them as your sounding board.\nNeeding to increase the size of your premises. This happens more often than expected. Once the stock starts piling up, you may find it ends up in your living room, bedroom and the garden shed. Think rental of storage premises if needed.",
                "Write the marketing plan. Your operational plan describes how you will produce your product, and your marketing plan describes how you will sell your product. When you create your marketing plan, try to answer the question of how you will make your product known to potential customers.\n\n\nYou will want to include the type of marketing you will use. For example, will you use radio ads, social media, promotions, billboards, attend networking events, or all of the above?\nYou will also want to define your marketing message. In other words, what will you say to convince customers to choose your product? Here, you want to focus on your Unique Selling Point (also known as USP). This is the unique advantage your product has to solve your customers problem. For example, you may be lower cost, faster, or higher quality than your peers.",
                "Come up with a pricing model. Start by checking out your competitors. Know how much are they selling a similar product for. Can you add something to it (add value) to make yours different and hence make it a more enticing price?\n\n\nCompetition isn't just about the goods or services themselves. It is also about your social and environmental credibility. Consumers are increasingly conscious of the need to show that your business is concerned with labor conditions and isn't damaging the environment. Certification endorsements from reputable organizations, such as labels and stars, can reassure customers that your product or service is more aligned with their values than one lacking the certification.",
                "Cover the financials. The financial statements translate your marketing and operational plans into numbers — profits and cash flow. They identify how much money you will need and how much you might make. Since this is the most dynamic part of your plan, and perhaps the most important for long-term stability, you should update this monthly for the first year, quarterly for the second year, and then annually after that.\n\n\nCover your startup costs. How are you going to finance your business initially? The bank, venture capitalists, angel investors, Small Business Administration (SBA), your own savings: these are all viable options. When you start a business, be realistic. You will probably not roll out of the gate making 100 percent of whatever you project, so you need to have enough ready reserve to fund things until you are really up and running. One of the surest roads to failure is under-capitalization.\nWhat price do you intend to sell your product or service for? How much will it cost you to produce? Work out a rough estimate for net profit—factoring in fixed costs like rent, energy, employees, etc.",
                "Come up with an executive summary. The first part of a business plan is the executive summary. Once you've developed the other parts, describe the overall business concept, how it will be monetized, how much funding you will need, where it stands currently, including its legal standing, people involved and a brief history, and anything else that makes your business look like a winning proposition.",
                "Build your product or develop your service. Once you have the business all planned, financed, and have your basic level of staffing, get going. Whether that's sitting down with the engineers and getting the software coded and tested, or getting materials sourced and shipped to your fabrication room (aka \"garage\"), or purchasing in bulk and marking up the price, the building process is the time during which you prepare for market. During this time, you may discover things such as:\n\n\nNeeding to tweak the ideas. Perhaps the product needs to be a different color, texture or size. Maybe your services need to be broader, narrower or more detailed. This is the time to attend to anything that crops up during your testing and development phases. You'll know innately when something needs tweaking to make it better or to make it less like a competitor's stale offerings.",
                "Secure start-up costs. Most businesses require capital to start. Money is typically required to purchase supplies and equipment, as well as keep the business operational for the period before your business becomes profitable. The first place to look for financing is yourself.[1].\n\n\nDo you have investments or savings? If so, consider using a portion to fund your business. You should never invest all your savings into a business due to the risk of failure. In addition, you should never invest money put aside for emergency savings (experts recommend having three to six months of income put aside for this purpose), or money you will need over the next few years for various obligations.\nConsider a home equity loan. If you have a home, looking to get a home equity loan can be a wise idea, since these loans are typically easily approved (since your home acts as collateral), and interest rates are typically lower.\nIf you have a 401(k) plan through your employer, consider borrowing against the plan. Plans typically allow you to borrow against 50% of your account balance up to a maximum of $50,000.\nConsider saving ahead as another option. If you have a job, save a portion of your monthly income over time to cover your start-up costs.\nVisit a bank to inquire about small business loans or lines of credit. When doing this, always visit many providers to ensure you are getting the best rate.",
                "Manage your running costs. Keep a close eye on your running costs and keep them in line with your projections. Whenever you see something spent wastefully—like electricity, phone plans, stationery, packaging—look around and estimate how much you really need, and minimize or remove the cost in every way possible. Think frugally when you start up, including renting items instead of purchasing them and using pre-paid plans for services your business needs instead of locking yourself into long-term contracts.",
                "Have more than the minimum. You may determine it will take $50,000 to start your business, and that's fine. You get your $50,000, buy your desks and printers and raw materials, and then then the second month arrives, and you're still in production, and the rent is due, and your employees want to be paid, and all the bills hit at once. When this happens, your only likely recourse will be to pack it in. If you can, try to have the reserves for a year of no income.",
                "Pinch those pennies. Plan to keep purchases of office equipment and overheads to a minimum when starting up. You do not need amazing office premises, the latest in office chairs and pricey artwork on the walls. A broom cupboard in the best address can be sufficient if you can artfully steer clients to the local coffee shop for meetings every time (meet them in the foyer). Many a business start-up has failed by purchasing the expensive gizmos instead of focusing on the business itself.",
                "Decide how to accept payment. You will need to do something to get payment from your clients or customers. You can get something like a Square, which is great for small businesses since it requires the minimum amount of paperwork and the fees are minimal. However, if you feel uncomfortable with technology, you can inquire about a more traditional merchant account.\n\n\nA merchant account is a contract under which an acquiring bank extends a line of credit to a merchant, who wishes to accept payment card transactions of a particular card association brand. Previously, without such a contract, one could not accept payments by any of the major credit card brands. However, the Square has changed that, so don’t feel locked in or limited to this option. Do your research.\nThe Square is a card swiping device which connects with a smartphone or tablet and turns that device into a sort of cash register. You may have encountered this device in the businesses you frequent, as they are becoming common at coffee shops, restaurants, street food stands and other businesses (look for a postage-stamp sized plastic square plugged into a tablet or phone).\nNote that PayPal, Intuit, and Amazon all offer similar solutions. Make sure to look into all options before making a selection.\nIf you are online business, services like PayPal offer an excellent way to receive payment and make transfers.",
                "Consider finding an attorney or other legal advisor. There will be many hurdles to leap as you go from working stiff to overworked and underpaid small business owner. Some of those hurdles will be composed of stacks of documents with rules and regulations, ranging from building covenants to city ordinances, county permits, state requirements, taxes, fees, contracts, shares, partnerships, and more. Having somebody you can call when the need arises will not only give you peace of mind, it will give you a much-needed resource who can help you plan for success.\n\n\nChoose someone with whom you \"click\" and who shows that he or she understands your business. You will also want someone with experience in this area, as an inexperienced legal advisor could lead you to legal trouble or even fines and prison time.",
                "Get an accountant. You’ll want someone who can deftly handle your financials, but even if you feel you can handle your own books, you’ll still need someone who understands the tax side of running a business. Taxes with businesses can get complicated, so you’ll need (at a minimum) a tax advisor. Again, no matter how much of your finances they’re handling, this should be someone trustworthy.",
                "Form a business entity. You’ll need to decide what type of business entity you want to be, for tax purposes and hopefully to eventually attract investors. You will do this after you've decided whether you will need money from others either in equity or loans and with the advice of your legal and accounting experts. It is one of the last steps taken before you actually spend money or ask someone for money. Most people are familiar with corporations, LLCs, etc., but for the vast majority of small business owners, you will need to form one of the following[2]:\n\n\nA sole proprietorship, if you will be running (not including employees) this business on your own or with your spouse.\nA general partnership, if you will be running this business with a partner.\nA limited partnership, which is composed of a few general partners, who are liable for problems with the business, and a few limited partners, who are only liable for the amount in which they invest in the business. All share profits and losses.\nA limited liability partnership (LLP), where no partner is liable for another’s negligence.",
                "Get a website. If you're selling online, get your ecommerce in gear and either build a website, or have one built for you. It's your storefront, so anything and everything you can do to make people want to visit, and want to stay, do it.\n\n\nAlternatively, if your business is more oriented toward the \"in person\" experience, traditional marketing may be just as important. For example, if you're starting a landscaping business, focus on getting the word out to neighbors before starting a website\nWhen making a website keep in mind that simplicity and clarity are key. A simple design that clearly states what you do, how you do it, and what you charge is most effective. When making your website, remember to emphasize why your business is the best solution to a clients problem.",
                "Hire professional designers. If you do decide to get a website, make sure it looks professional. Designers may cost more initially, but a well presented and trustworthy site is essential. It needs to look professional and work with ease. If you are including money transactions, invest in security encryption and check that your money transfer companies are sound and reliable.",
                "Discover your inner publicist. You might truly believe in your product or service, but in order for it to be successful, everyone else must believe in it too. If you're new to advertising and marketing or you dislike doing the sales pitch, now is the time to overcome such feelings and put on the publicist persona. You need to develop an excellent short pitch to convince people they need your product or service, one that reflects the value, purpose and potential of what your business is offering. Write down this pitch in many ways until you find one that you feel satisfied says it all and is something you can say readily. Then practice it like crazy!\n\n\nDepending on your business, it could be appropriate to have interesting, eye-catching business cards printed.",
                "Spend time developing an excellent social media presence. This can be done well before the business is ready, increasing anticipation. Use Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, and any other social media you participate in to build excitement and spread the word. You want to build a buzz so that people will begin following your progress. (Be sure to choose business accounts for your business and keep your personal accounts separate. The messages you send should be tailored differently, depending on which account you're sending from.)",
                "Implement your marketing and distribution plans. With your product being built or services developed, and a reasonable expectation on when either is ready for selling, begin marketing.\n\n\nIf you will be advertising in periodicals, they will need copy or images at least two months in advance of publication.\nIf you will be selling in stores, get pre-orders sold, and shelf space allocated. If you will be selling online, get that e-commerce site ready to sell.\nIf you're offering a service, advertise in appropriate trade and professional journals, newspapers and online.",
                "Secure space. Whether it's an office, or a warehouse, if you need more space than your garage or your spare bedroom, now's the time to get that.\n\n\nIf you don't generally need an office beyond your home, but may occasionally need meeting space, there are often places that can address those needs. A quick Google search on \"business meeting rentals [your city/state]\" will deliver plenty of rental options in your area.\nBe sure to contact your local municipality about zoning laws. Some types of small businesses cannot be ran out of a home, and it is important to ensure your business is operating within its proper zone.",
                "Launch your product or your service. When the product is all built, packaged, coded, online, and ready to sell, or when your services are fully worked out and ready to go, hold a special event to launch your business. Send out a press release, announce it to the world. Tweet it, Facebook it, let the word resound to all corners of your market—you have a new business!\n\n\nHold a party and invite people who can spread the word for you. It doesn't need to be pricey––purchase the food and drink from bulk discount stores and get family and friends to help with catering (you can give them a product or service in return)."

        "wikiHow to Talk to Spirits": {
            "intro": "Whether you’re trying to contact a particular spirit or just want to speak to the spirit world, you can contact spirits using a dowsing pendulum or a Ouija Board as long as you’re patient, keep an open mind, and follow the safe and correct steps to do so.",
            "steps": [
                "Protect yourself psychically. If you try to contact the spirit world, you may come in contact with malevolent entities. Therefore, it’s important to strengthen your mind against negative energies before attempting to talk to spirits. For example:\n\n\nOffer a prayer to the universe. While praying, ask for protection against malevolent spirits.\nVisualize yourself as a column of white light that spreads throughout the room. This visualization will dissuade negative entities.\nMentally express an interest in communicating with positive spirits to draw them to you.[1]",
                "Find a charm. If you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, such as a deceased loved one, you will need a charm to draw them to you.[2] A charm can be anything that the spirit owned while they were alive. Choose an item that held a lot of meaning for that person. Examples of meaningful items include:\n\n\nJewelry\nNotebooks or journals\nPhotographs\nA beloved book",
                "Avoid using alcohol or drugs. Alcohol and drugs affect your judgement and can make you more vulnerable to negative spirits. Additionally, some people believe that being intoxicated can attract harmful entities.[3]\n\nIf any of your friends are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, don’t let them participate in the session.",
                "Burn sage incense. Sage is an herb that is known for its aura cleansing properties. If you’re worried about the presence of malevolent spirits, burn some sage incense before contacting the spirit world. The sage will remove negative energies from the room and dissuade any unwanted visitors.[4]\n\nSage incense can be bought online or at specialty herbal supply stores.",
                "Purchase or create a dowsing crystal. A dowsing crystal is a crystal that’s hanging on the end of a string or chain. You should feel a sense of attachment to the crystal when you hold it.[5] This indicates that your energy is in tune with the crystal. To find a good dowsing crystal:\n\n\nVisit a specialty herb shop and pick out a crystal. Hold each one to find one that “speaks” to you.\nUse a crystal necklace that was owned by a deceased loved one.\nTie a piece of string around a crystal that you have owned for years.",
                "Dangle the crystal over a flat surface. Hold the end of the chain in your dominant hand.[6] Next, dangle the crystal over a hard surface, such as a table or the floor. The crystal should be near the surface, but not touching it.\n\n\nSome people prefer to dangle the crystal over a circle drawn on a piece of paper. This can help you track the movements of the crystal.",
                "Determine “yes” and “no” answers. Gently swing the crystal once or twice. Holding your hand steady, ask the spirits to show you a “yes” answer. Make a note of the pattern that the crystal follows. Once the crystal is still, repeat the process, asking for a “no” answer.[7]\n\nThis pattern may change from session to session.",
                "Begin asking questions. Ask yes or no questions and take note of the answers. For example, if you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, you might ask: “Is your name Sandra Burdoch?” The spirit will then direct the crystal in a yes or no formation.\n\n\nTake any messages received with a grain of salt. Some spirits may try to trick you or they may even be confused.[8]\n\nBe polite when talking with spirits and treat them with respect.",
                "End the session. Thank the spirit for speaking with you. Politely ask them to return to the spirit world.[9] Next, set the crystal down. Center yourself in the present by eating some food or having a cup of tea.\n\n\nIf you feel a presence lingering after you’ve ended the session, burn some sage incense to cleanse the room.",
                "Purchase or make a Ouija board. Ouija boards can be bought online or from specialized novelty shops. Occasionally, rare and ornate Ouija boards can be found at estate sales or antique shops. To make your own Ouija board, write the alphabet, the numbers 1-9, “yes,” “no,” and “goodbye” on a large sheet of paper. Next, purchase a planchette or make your own.\n\n\nThe term planchette refers to the small wooden arrow used to navigate the Ouija board.\nPlanchettes can be purchased online or from specialized novelty shops.",
                "Gather a few friends. Never use a Ouija board alone. Instead, gather one or two friends to use the board with you.[10] The presence of others will repel any cowardly malevolent spirits and bolster your courage.\n\n\nMake sure your friends will take the process seriously. If they show a lack of respect, it could have bad consequences.",
                "Set up the Ouija board. Lay the board on a table or other flat surface. Next, place the planchette on top of the board. Ask your friends to sit around the table and lightly place their index and middle fingers on the planchette.\n\n\nRelax your arms and fingers while touching the planchette. Otherwise, you may unconsciously move the planchette around on your own.",
                "Summon a spirit. Choose one person to be the medium, or the person who communicates with the spirit. Next, the medium should politely ask a spirit to visit. Wait patiently for the planchette to move. Once it starts moving independently, a spirit has appeared.[11]\n\nThis process can take several minutes.",
                "Ask the spirit questions. Once the spirit appears, the medium can begin asking questions. If you ask yes or no questions, the planchette will hover over the “yes” or “no” words on the board. If you ask more complex questions, the spirit may spell out words or even sentences. Consider asking questions such as:\n\n\n”What’s your name?”\n”Are you a ghost?”\n”Do you have a message for us?”",
                "Learn to recognize bad spirits. If the planchette moves randomly across the board without giving any clear answers, the spirit is not interested in helping you. If the planchette moves in a figure eight, the spirit is attempting to take control of the board. End the session immediately.[12]\n\nIf you begin to feel a lot of fear, end the session. Fear can invite negative spirits into the Ouija board.",
                "Close the connection. Guide the planchette over the word “goodbye” on the board. This will close the Ouija board’s connection to the spirit world. Once the session has ended, wrap the planchette in a piece of cloth and store it separately from the board.[13]\n\nIf you store the planchette and the board together, you risk unintentionally inviting spirits into your home."

            "steps": [
                "Be clean and hygienic. Being clean is all about being fresh and looking your best. If you're clean, you'll look great and feel even better.\n\n\n\nTake a shower every day, preferably in the morning. The shower will wake you up, and there's a chance your body could sweat in the night.\nNOTE: If you have brothers or sisters who take showers in the morning, and there is only one shower, take a shower before you go to bed. If it's hot out, don't sleep with the covers, and sleep with the sheets instead!\nWash your hair every other day. Washing it too often can strip natural oils and cause frizziness.\nFind shampoos and conditioners that suit your hair's texture. If you have a dry scalp, you may consider using a dandruff shampoo.\nDon't use too much of any product. Too much gel or mousse can result in a really bad hair day!",
                "Moisturize your skin. Drink a lot of water and find a lotion that suits your skin. There are different types of lotion for different skin types.\n\n\nIf your face is oily, always use moisturizer. It may seem ironic but it's still important. Use one that's meant for someone who has acne.\nIf your skin is dry, use a thicker cream based moisturizer. It will help your skin stay moisturized longer.",
                "Wash your face daily, once in the morning and once at night. Washing your face will help wash away dirt and layers of skin that build up over the day.\n\n\nTry to find a face wash that is appropriate for your skin. You probably want a \"non-comedogenic\" wash, which simply means that it won't clog your pores.\nIf you're beginning to get pimples, use over the counter acne products. If it's getting worse and you're worried about it, visit your doctor who can prescribe something to help.",
                "Get a nice haircut. Find a length that compliments the shape of your face and that you're happy with. Your hair makes a big impact on your image.\n\n\nAsk your hairstylist what would be suitable for you. Choose a hairstyle that is easy to maintain.",
                "Instead of using perfume, use a nice smelling lotion.\n\n\nNice smelling soap can give off a perfume scent, as can deodorant!",
                "If you have braces, it's not bad. Almost everybody has them at some point.\n\n\nTry to stay clear of getting more than two colors. Even two colors may look a little too harsh for your face. Choose pastel or neutral colors--they look very pretty on braces.\nStay away from yellow and neon blue! They will make your teeth look yellow, and not white.",
                "Wear nice clothes. Wear clothes that properly fit and that you feel good in.\n\n\nDress for the weather. If it's summer, wear something that's light and cool. If it's winter, wear something that will keep you warm.",
                "Wear colors that suit you. Certain colors look better on certain skin tones and with certain hair colors.\n\n\nWear blues, greens, and browns to bring out your eyes, and pinks to bring out the pink in your cheeks.\nRedheads look beautiful in green; however, avoid lime or neon greens. Try to find dark forest greens that make your hair stand out.\nIf your skin has yellow tones, be careful wearing oranges and yellows.",
                "Have at least one cute pair of shoes.\n\n\nGo for different shoes in different seasons. If you live in a place that gets cold during the winter, you obviously wouldn't wear flip-flops in December.",
                "Smile a lot. A smile is a great accessory! Brush your teeth twice or more every day to get a beautiful white smile.\n\n\nIf you can't brush your teeth after every meal, chew on a piece of sugar-free gum. It'll make your breath smell nice and keep your teeth clean.",
                "Build self-confidence. Confidence is attractive, so be proud of who you are.\n\n\nThrow your shoulders back and your chin up high.\nKeep your hair out of your face and smile.",
                "Be proud of yourself, and never criticize your looks. Everyone is unique. Your \"flaws\" aren't something to be ashamed of—they're what make you distinctly YOU.\n\n\nDon't try to be someone you're not.\nRemind yourself everyday of the people who love you! Your family, your best friends, your pets, your teachers... it will boost your confidence!"

The lawyer is aggressive, and the witness either folds under the intense questioning or erupts in anger. In real life, cross-examination can be much less dramatic—if you prepare properly. You can survive even an aggressive cross-examination by carefully reviewing your prior testimony and practicing with your attorney. The day of the trial, you should commit to remaining calm and carefully listening to the lawyer’s questions.

Take a notepad with you so you can capture your thoughts as you watch the cross-examination.\n\n\nBe objective and ask yourself which witnesses seem the most credible. Do witnesses who get defensive seem like they are hiding something? Are you more impressed by someone who never gets rattled and takes their time before answering?\nAlso pay attention to the importance of non-visual cues. Do you make assumptions about a witness based on what they are wearing or whether they have tattoos and flashy jewelry?",
                "Review all of your prior statements. You should expect the lawyer to be well prepared for cross-examination. They have read your deposition testimony, any statements given to police, and your testimony from other trials (if any). You should review all of this testimony as well.[1]\n\nYour lawyer should have copies of any deposition testimony and police statements. Call him or her and ask to review that information.\nLook for contradictions in your statements, even if small. You can expect a lawyer to shine a spotlight on these during cross-examination.\nDon’t forget statements you made to third parties, even if not written down. Did you talk about the case with your mother? What did you say? If you told a different story to third parties, then the other side could call them to testify at trial depending on how important a witness you are.",
                "Practice your testimony on cross-examination. Ideally, your lawyer will do a dry run practice session. Your lawyer can pretend to be the attorney cross-examining you. After the practice session, you and your lawyer can review your testimony.\n\n\nPractice with a friend or family member if your lawyer won’t do a practice session. Think of what questions the other side might have.\nYou obviously can’t anticipate every question you will be asked. Nevertheless, you will be asked about contradictions in your statements and general questions about your ability to see or hear whatever you are testifying about.\nPractice your answers. You don’t want to sound rehearsed. But you want to feel comfortable and confident. Look at yourself in a mirror and judge how you appear as you talk.",
                "Inform your lawyer of any problems with your testimony. Your lawyer can defuse any bad fact by addressing it first on direct testimony. For example, if you’ve been convicted of a felony, then your lawyer can bring that up. It will take some of the sting out of the negative information.\n\n\nIf you made misstatements in prior testimony (such as a deposition), let your lawyer know. They will give you a chance to correct it on direct testimony.\nIf you have criminal convictions or convictions for perjury (lying), let your lawyer know. You can be sure the other side’s attorney will raise these issues on cross-examination.\nLet your lawyer know if you have a personal relationship with either party in the case. For example, you might testify on behalf of someone who is also your business partner. Your lawyer needs to know this fact. You can expect the other side will argue you are biased because of your personal relationship.",
                "Realize your attorney can clarify confusion. Lawyers are skilled at asking “yes or no” questions. These aren’t really questions at all. Instead, they are assertions of fact to which you respond by agreeing or disagreeing. You might be tempted to answer one of these questions with, “Yes, but can I explain?” However, you should realize that the attorney cross-examining you probably won’t let you explain your answer.[2]\n\nNevertheless, when you answer at trial, you should still say, “May I explain?”[3]\n\nYour lawyer will have a chance to question you again after the other side’s lawyer.[4] This is called “redirect.” On redirect, your lawyer can then let you add context or detail to more fully explain your answer.",
                "Eat a good breakfast the day of trial. Cross-examination can be emotionally draining. You’ll want to be mentally sharp, so eat a solid breakfast on the morning of the trial. You don’t want to crash because of low blood sugar or hunger.[5]",
                "Remain calm. Avoid taking anything the attorney says personally. You should realize that they have a job to do and one of their jobs is to rattle you on the witness stand. Accordingly, you should always try to remain calm during cross-examination.[6]\n\nNo matter how the lawyer acts, pretend that they are not being hostile or obnoxious.[7] Just imagine this is how they always act.\nIf you feel your heart rate pick up, then take a deep breath.",
                "Listen carefully to the question. You want to only answer the question asked and never volunteer anything. If you don’t understand the question, ask the attorney to repeat or rephrase the question. Remember to listen to the words the lawyer asks, not their tone.[8] To test whether you understood the question, repeat it to yourself in your mind.[9] If you can’t repeat it, you didn’t hear it.\n\n\nSay, “I’m sorry, I don’t understand the question.” The attorney should then rephrase the question.\nDon’t ask for clarification simply to stall for time. Eventually, you will have to answer a legitimate question, so you don’t benefit from delay.",
                "Pause before answering. Don’t cut off the attorney before they complete their question. Jurors will consider that behavior rude.[10] Instead, take a breath and pause before answering.\n\n\nPausing also gives your attorney a chance to object. If the judge sustains the objection, you don’t have to answer. For this reason, don’t rush to answer after the question is asked.\nYou should wait three to five seconds before responding. During this time you can repeat the question in your mind and think about your answer.",
                "Don’t guess. On cross-examination, a lawyer might ask questions you don’t know the answer to. Instead of guessing, say “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember.”[11] It’s more important to be accurate than to come across as someone who has all of the answers.\n\n\nAt the same time, be positive about the details you do remember. If you are asked what the weather was like on a certain day, say, “It was sunny” if you remember that fact. Don’t hedge every answer with, “I think” or “If I remember correctly.”[12]",
                "Answer honestly. Truth is the best defense. It’s also illegal to lie while under oath. You could be prosecuted for perjury, and could be sentenced to jail or forced to pay a heavy fine.\n\n\nDon’t worry whether or not the truth helps or hurts your side’s case.[13] That’s for the lawyer to handle, not you.\nSome questions may be embarrassing. For example, expert witnesses sometimes get embarrassed when asked about their hourly rate. You shouldn’t be.[14]\n\nYou also shouldn’t be embarrassed if you were the victim of a crime. Some people think they are to blame for being cheated or attacked. You aren’t.",
                "Choose your words carefully. There is no contradiction between being careful and honest. Avoid just blurting out whatever comes to mind. Instead, think carefully before answering. It’s important not to provide misleading information.[15]\n\nYou also don’t want to exaggerate.[16] Try to avoid overly broad statements, particularly those that include the words “always” and “never.”",
                "Speak confidently. A confident witness testifies loudly and slowly enough so they are audible.[17] If you feel nervous, then you might begin breathing from your throat. As a result, you might lose your voice. It is important that jurors and the judge hear you.\n\n\nBreathe from your diaphragm. Reach down and place a hand on your stomach. You should feel your stomach go in and out as you breathe.\nAlso make eye contact with the lawyer. Don’t get into a staring contest, but be sure to make eye contact as you are being questioned. When answering, turn to the jury and look at the jurors.\nAvoid looking toward the judge or your own side’s lawyer during cross-examination. They can’t answer for you.[18]",
                "Avoid humor. Your instincts might be to defuse a tense situation by making a joke. You should avoid that.[19] People have different tastes in humor, and your joke could be offensive to someone. Furthermore, jurors might think you aren’t treating the trial seriously.\n\n\nIf you feel tense, then take a deep breath instead.",
                "Ask to read a document if you are testifying about it. Sometimes, you will be asked about a document you wrote or signed. You should always ask the lawyer to review the document before testifying about it.[20] You probably don’t remember exactly what was written and should refresh your memory.\n\n\nSay, “Can I review it before answering to refresh my memory?”\nSometimes lawyers might pretend to quote from a document when the language doesn’t appear in the document. Don’t accept the lawyer’s version. Instead, confirm for yourself what the document says.",
                "Correct mistakes immediately. If you misspoke or weren’t clear, then clarify what you said. Say, “Can I correct something I said?”[21] Look at the attorney and then up at the judge. It’s ultimately up to the judge whether you can speak.\n\n\nDon’t be flustered. A lawyer might blow small errors out of proportion, but that doesn’t mean the jury will assume it is a big deal.\nProvide the correct information and, if possible, give a short explanation for why you misstated the truth earlier.",
                "Dress professionally. You don’t get to control the questions the other side’s lawyer asks you on cross-examination. However, you can convey a lot of important information to juries and the judge based on how you look. Generally, you should look professional and dress in clean, neat clothes.\n\n\nAvoid being too casual and also too dressy.[22] You don’t have to wear a suit unless you normally would for your job.\nGenerally, business casual clothing is almost always acceptable. This means dress pants and a dress shirt. Women can also wear a skirt with a blouse or a conservative dress.",
                "Sit still. Jurors will assume you are nervous if you fidget or tap your feet while on the witness stand. Furthermore, jurors will assume you are nervous because you have something to hide. Accordingly, you should remain as calm as possible.\n\n\nDon’t chew gum while on the witness stand.[23] That is disrespectful.\nIf you begin fidgeting, consciously clasp your hands together and rest them in your lap.",
                "Sit up straight. You will appear more confident if you sit up straight with your shoulders back than if you are hunched over.[24] You should actually practice sitting in front of a mirror to make sure you know what it feels like to sit up straight.\n\n\nHowever, if you are the victim of a crime, then sitting up straight might not work to your advantage. Jurors assume you are afraid of the defendant. If you appear too confident, juries might think you are lying.",
                "Do not show emotion when others testify. Depending on the court, you might be able to sit in the courtroom after you testify. If so, you must remain poker-faced.[25] Remember that jurors can still see you, even after you’ve finished your testimony. How you act will impact how much credibility they give your testimony in the jury room.\n\n\nSit without showing emotion. Don’t shake your head if you hear another witness lie on the witness stand.\nIf you can’t keep your emotions in check, then leave the courtroom (unless you are the defendant). You can come back when the jury delivers its verdict."

        "How to Paint PVC": {
            "intro": "Because of its slick outer surface, most people think PVC pipe is difficult or impossible to paint. But with the right tools and preparation, it’s actually quite easy. While it’s true that PVC contains certain compounds that makes the plastic water-resistant and keeps foreign substances from sticking to it, some light scouring and a coat of primer will allow you to change the color of your PVC installation to any shade you please.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather your materials. For a basic PVC paint job, you’ll need a large sheet of high-grit sandpaper, a small container of acetone, a clean washcloth, one or more cans of spray paint in your chosen color and the PVC you wish to paint. Make sure you have everything you need before you begin painting.\n\n\nPractice proper workshop safety. Wear gloves, protective eyewear and a ventilated facemask to filter out dust and chemicals.[1]\n\nChoose a spray paint that’s specially formulated for use on plastics, such as Krylon Fusion or Rust-Oleum Plastic.",
                "Prepare your work area. Lay down a large dropcloth or plastic tarp where you plan to do your painting. Keep all furniture and nearby appliances and electronics covered. Remember to work in a space that permits proper airflow, like a garage or workshop with the doors and windows open.[2]\n\nWork in a well-ventilated, open space. This will not only help the paint dry faster but keep you from being exposed to harmful acetone and paint fumes.[3]\n\nSpray paint tends to disperse when it’s applied, so a dropcloth will be useful for protecting floors, countertops and other work surfaces.\nIf you don’t have access to a dropcloth, you could also use a few overlapping sheets of newspaper.",
                "Measure and cut the PVC for its intended use. The PVC should already be the right size and shape for the project you have planned. Take care of any necessary measuring, cutting and assembling in advance. That way, all you’ll have to do is add a custom color and install.[4]\n\nIf the PVC you’re painting needs to be fitted with elbow corners, for instance, they should be in place prior to sanding and painting.",
                "Sand the outside of the PVC. Go over the outer surface of the PVC with a high-grit sandpaper. The most efficient way to do this is to place the sheet of sandpaper in your palm and wrap your whole hand around the pipe. You can then scour the PVC from one end to the other with a wrapping motion to achieve a uniform finish.[5]\n\nAvoid over-sanding the PVC, as this can result in walls of inconsistent thicknesses that may wear out at a faster rate.\nA fine sandpaper with a grit of 220 or higher is recommended.[6]",
                "Treat the PVC with acetone. Place the corner of a clean, dry cloth over the mouth of an upturned bottle of acetone to dampen it. Then, wipe the acetone over the sanded PVC. You don’t need to use a lot—just enough to prepare the surface of the PVC for painting.[7]\n\nWiping the PVC will help remove any loose grit left over from sanding.\nThe acetone will also cause the plastic to expand and become more porous, allowing it to hold paint better.[8]",
                "Apply multiple coats of spray paint. Using slow, steady strokes, spray a light mist of paint down the length of the PVC pipe, making each pass as light as possible to prevent drips or runs. After you’ve painted one edge of the PVC, rotate it to paint the other side. Aim for a smooth, even finish free of bald spots and defects.[9]\n\nContinue applying additional coats until you reach the desired depth of color.\nLet the paint dry for 20 to 30 minutes between coats.[10]",
                "Allow the painted PVC to dry. Once you’ve achieved the color and coverage you want, set the PVC aside and let it begin to set. Painted PVC will require 24 hours or more to dry to the touch. The paint should be sufficiently cured to withstand heat, pressure and scratches before being used in household or construction projects.[11]\n\nIf you plan on using the PVC for especially messy or heavy-duty jobs, it may need to cure for as long as one 20-30 days.[12]",
                "Sand the PVC to prepare it for painting. Scour the entire area of the PVC pipe to roughen up the slick exterior. This will help color settle into the plastic more easily. Use a consistent pressure and stroke length to get an even finish.[13]\n\nThink twice before using an electric sander. This can shave away too much of the PVC.",
                "Wipe the PVC down with acetone. Clear away as much dust and grit as you can. Let the acetone dry for 20-30 minutes. Be sure to wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated space during this part.\n\nRewet the cloth as needed to cover the area you sanded.\nTry not to oversaturate the PVC. Too much acetone may eat away at the plastic, weakening its structure.[14]",
                "Apply a base coat of primer. Brush on a light layer of primer, working lengthwise from end to end. Primer is indispensable for encouraging paint to stick to surfaces that are otherwise too smooth to hold it. A single coat should be enough to do the trick.[15]\n\nLook for primer in a basic matte white. This will be versatile enough to make any shade of paint show up clearly and vividly.",
                "Brush on the first coat of paint. Once again, apply the paint in long, smooth strokes from one end to the other, the same way you did the primer. Turn the PVC as you go, painting overlapping stripes until you you’ve covered every edge.[16]\n\nUse a small, soft-bristled brush not much wider than the pipe.\nLook for paints that will mimic the waterproofing effect of PVC, like a semigloss satin, latex or acrylic.[17]",
                "Use additional coats as needed. You may need to layer on multiple coats before the color really starts to show. The color will darken and deepen with each subsequent coat. When you’re done, leave the PVC to dry for 24-48 hours. Afterwards, you’ll have a vibrant, resilient section of plastic piping to put to use in just about any project imaginable![18]\n\nMost paint jobs will require an average of 2-3 separate coats.\nBe careful not to apply the paint so heavily that it creates visible drips."

        "How to Recognize Head Lice": {
            "intro": "You might recognise whether you have head lice. Head lice are greyish brown insects that live on your scalp and feed on blood. Seek medical help for an examination if you feel itchiness very often and may also see little bugs come out of your hair as you itch.",
            "steps": [
                "Use a fine-toothed louse comb to help identify living head lice. Head lice move quickly and avoid light, so a fine-toothed comb will be handy in a thorough examination.\n\n\nYou can check for lice with both dry or wet hair. If you're checking with wet hair, wash and condition your hair before going over you hair with a comb.\nIn order to check your hair with a fine-toothed comb, use these steps:\nUse an ordinary brush to detangle hair\nSwitch to the fine-toothed comb and start combing at the front middle of the scalp\nComb the hair from the roots to the ends, examining the comb after each stroke\nDo this over your entire head\n\n\nPeople with thicker hair may want to look for lice after washing their hair. In this case, using conditioner, or one tablespoon of olive oil, may make running the nit comb through your hair easier.",
                "Look for nits (head louse eggs) at the base of the hair shaft using the same technique. Nits don't move, so they'll be easier to spot. Pay careful attention to the areas behind the ears and near the base of the neck when checking for nits.",
                "Use a magnifying glass to make identification of head lice easier. Dandruff and dirt can sometimes be mistaken for head lice.",
                "If you find lice or nits, be sure to treat the person showing signs of head lice. You can treat them in the following way:\n\n\nTry a non-prescription lotion or shampoo. Their main ingredient is often 1% permethrin. Apply the lotion of shampoo as directed, waiting 8 to 12 hours and then checking for active lice again.\nTry a prescription strength lotion or shampoo. Malathion 0.5% may be prescribed in cases where non-prescription lotions or shampoos do not have the desired efficacy. It is supposed to be left in the hair for a period of 12 hours.\nMake sure the lice don't spread:\nWash all clothing and bedding in hot water immediately\nRemove any lice and eggs you comb out of the person's hair\nDo not share clothing, especially articles like hats that are worn on the head",
                "Look for the following symptoms a tickling feeling or an itching sensation in your hair. It's pretty much what it sounds like. Humans are allergic to the (very small) amounts of saliva that lice inject into the skin in order to retrieve blood.[1] If you have intense itchiness in your scalp area, check for head lice.",
                "Look for sores on the head caused by scratching. These sores can sometimes become infected with bacteria normally found on a person’s skin.",
                "Look for small red bumps on the scalp. These bumps are caused when the lice farm blood from your scalp. They may ooze or become crusty.[2]"

        "How to Remove Caulking Stains from Clothes": {
            "intro": "Caulk can be one of the most stubborn materials to remove from clothing. True to its nature, it seeps into the fibers of the clothing and seals itself there. With patience and persistence, however, you can use in-home methods to remove this stubborn goop from your garments.",
            "steps": [
                "Put the clothing in the freezer. If you don't notice the stain for several days, place the garment in the freezer for a few hours. This will cause the caulk to harden. After a few days, you should be able to easily \"peel\" most of the goop off with your fingernails or a butter knife. Once the caulk is solid, carefully peel it off the article of clothing. The biggest chunk should come off in a glob.[1]\n\nAlternately, use an ice cube. Hold an ice cube in place over the stain until it freezes. Once frozen, the caulk will loosen and can be pulled off more easily.",
                "Scrape the stain from the clothing with scissors. Chip away at the caulk, bit by bit – this may be easier once the stain is frozen. You can also use a butter knife, a file, or another scraping tool. Be careful not to cut yourself or the clothing!",
                "Finish the job. After the excess is removed, clean any remaining stain with rubbing alcohol or another cleaning agent. You should be able to scrape or peel off the bulk, but some stain might remain.",
                "Tackle the caulk stain as quickly as possible. If you notice the stains before it has a chance to dry, you might be more likely to remove it all. Try running your clothing through a regular washing cycle in your washing machine with standard detergent. If the clothing is white, add bleach for extra washing power. New caulk stains or ones that have not completely dried may come off with a normal wash.[2]",
                "Blot the stain with water. Wet a rag or a paper towel. Press the towel firmly against the caulk, and let the moisture sink in. Dab the area again and again, and gently rub the stain out of the fabric. Try to blot as much of the caulk as possible off of the garment.",
                "Dab the caulk with rubbing alcohol. After you have removed as much excess caulk as you can, wet a piece of folded paper towel with some rubbing alcohol. Blot the stain, firmly, and let the alcohol soak deep into the fabric. Dab the stain as many times as needed to remove the stain.\n\n\nYou may need to reapply several times to remove the stain. Add more alcohol each time.\nAlways use a clean section of the towel. If the towel becomes overly stained and saturated with caulk, you may need to switch to another rag.[3]",
                "Wash the clothing. Once the stain is removed, launder the garment in cold or warm water. When you remove the garment from the washer, examine the stain to make sure it's completely removed. You may have to wash it a few times to get the stain completely out. Don't place it in a dryer with any stain remaining, since the heat will set it.",
                "Use a chemical cleaner. Purchase a commercial cleaner, such as Goof Off Stain Remover, to finish the job. Look for specific caulk removers. Follow all instructions and warnings supplied by the manufacturer to ensure proper cleaning.[4]\n\nWarning: Always pretest new cleaners on old clothing before applying it to important or favorite garments.",
                "Try using hand sanitizer. Antibacterial sanitizing products can remove some stains from clothing, and they may be effective on caulk. First, squeeze the sanitizer onto the stained area. Rub the spot gently with a tissue or a damp rag. You may need to use several applications of sanitizer if the stain is especially bad.",
                "Rub with baking soda. Wet the stain with water. Pour baking soda onto the fabric while it's still wet. Massage the baking soda into the fabric with a rag or towel until the caulk comes out.\n\n\nIf the stain does not come out completely, keep trying. Put the clothing in the wash afterward, and results will improve even more."

        "wikiHow to Grow Tomatoes Indoors": {
            "intro": "Growing tomatoes indoors will allow you to produce fresh, flavorful tomatoes throughout the winter months. Instead of consuming flavorless grocery store tomatoes, you will be able to feast on a fresh, homegrown harvest of tomatoes. Growing indoors is also useful if you live in a multi-unit building and do not have access to an outdoor space for growing vegetables.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a suitable variety. You have some choice when it comes to tomatoes, especially between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. Both will have advantages for indoor gardens, so think about which kind is best for your purposes.[1][2]\n\nIndeterminate tomatoes can be ideal for indoor gardens. Unlike determinate varieties, they will naturally climb and need a cage, trellis, or stake. But they’ll continue to grow and produce fruit all season long. If you are looking for a variety of tomato that will bear a lot of fruit and ripen quickly, choose a plum or cherry indeterminate.\nIndeterminate tomatoes aren’t compact and need more space than determinates, though. If your space is limited, try smaller, dwarf determinate varieties. These should fruit over a 4-6 week period.\nHeirloom indeterminates include Pink Ping Pong, Siberia, Silvery Fir Tree, Tommy Toe, and Yellow Pear. Hybrid indeterminates include Micro Tom, Orange Pixie Tomato, Patio, Red Robin, Small Fry, Tiny Tim, and Totem.[3]\n\nDeterminate cherry tomatoes include Washington Cherry and Gold Nugget. Hybrid determinates include Cherries Jubilee and Terenzo Hybrid.",
                "Plant your tomato seeds in a starting mix. Wet your seed starter mix or potting soil with fresh water until it is moist. Fill a seedling starter tray with a moist mix or soil. Poke one hole in the soil of each cell—the hole should be ¼ inch deep. Insert up to 3 seeds into each hole with a tweezers or your fingers. Cover the holes with moist soil or mix.\n\nSow the seeds 60-80 days before you intend to harvest your tomatoes.\nIf you don’t have seed trays, you can use plastic yogurt containers or cans.\nIf you are planting the seeds in a used container, clean the container with a 1:10 bleach:water solution.[4]",
                "Promote germination with consistent heat and water. Germination is the process of transformation from a seed to a seedling. Tomato seeds will germinate within five to ten days. There are several actions you can take to speed up this process and to ensure its success.\n\n\nImmediately after planting the seeds, cover your seedlings with a lid or a sheet of plastic wrap—this will prevent the soil from drying out.\nMove the cells to a warm location. Throughout the germination, maintain a daytime soil temperature between 70 to 80℉. If you can not heat the space to at least 70℉, consider purchasing a heat mat or placing the plant cells in a sunny location.\nEveryday, lift up the lid and water the seeds as needed.[5]",
                "Move your sprouted seedlings to a sunny or artificially lit location. Tomato seedlings and plants require at least 8 hours of light each day. Without adequate light, tomato plants will become weak. As soon as the seeds have sprouted, discard of the cover and provide your seedlings with ample light. If you have a south-facing window, place the cells directly in front of the window. If you do not have a south-facing window, shine a grow-light or a fluorescent light on the seedlings.\n\n\nArtificial light sources should be placed a few inches from the tops of the seedlings. As the plants grow, you will need to adjust the height of the lamps.\nIf you are keeping your plants on a windowsill or in front of a window, rotate them frequently to ensure that every side is exposed to light.[6]",
                "Transplant your seedlings into large pots. As soon as your seedlings grow one to two sets of leaves, they are on the verge of outgrowing their cells. At this time, transplant the seedlings into a pot that is large enough to hold a mature plant—a five to ten gallon container is ideal.\n\nRemove the seedlings from their cells without breaking the roots. Hold the seedling between two fingers and place your palm over the soil. Flip the cell upside down and gently tap the bottom of the cell until the seedling emerges.\nLoosen up the roots by “tickling” the outer roots.\nBury the seedling up to the little fuzzy hairs at the base of the plant. These fuzzy hairs will become roots.\nWater the seedling generously after transplant.[7]",
                "Water your plants when dry. After you transplant your seedlings, it is imperative that you continue to water the plants regularly. Assess the soil everyday for dryness by sticking your finger into the soil. If the soil is dry, water the the plant. If the topsoil is dry but the rest is moist, water at a later time.\n\n\nAllowing the soil to dry out completely will yield rough-bottom tomatoes.[8]",
                "Create day and night time light conditions. While tomato plants require plenty of light, they also need a period of darkness. If you are using artificial lights, you need to mimic the natural rising and setting of the sun. Turn on your lights in the morning. After twelve to sixteen hours, turn off the lights and allow the plants to rest in the dark.\n\n\nYou can set your lights on a timer.[9]",
                "Fertilize the seedlings. Indeterminate tomato varieties continue to grow and produce all season. To sustain this intense cycle, you must provide your tomato plants with adequate nutrients. Within two weeks of transplanting, apply your first fertilizer treatment. Following the initial application, continue to fertilize your plants every few weeks until it is mature.\n\n\nUse a fertilizer that is high in phosphorous.\nFollow the instructions on the product.[10]",
                "Train your plant to grow up. Indeterminate tomato plants require support from a stake or trellis for their vines. It is possible to “train” your tomatoes to grow up a trellis, stake, or cage. You can begin to train your tomato plants approximately one month after transplanting.\n\n\nIf you are using a single stake or a single-string trellis, you will train the main stem. Attach the stem to the support device with twine every six to eight inches. Tie the twine in a loose knot to avoid damaging the plant. As suckers grow (vines that appear between the main stem and branches) prune them by snapping them off with your fingers at the joint.\nIf you are using a cage or multi-string trellis, you will begin by training the main stem. Place a cage over the plant while it is small – it is harder to get cages over mature plants. Tie the main stem to the support device with twine every six to eight inches. Allow the first three or four suckers that appear to remain on the plant. Train these suckers in the same manner—tie the suckers to the trellis or cage every six to eight inches as they grow. As new suckers appear, prune them.[11]",
                "Assist in the pollination process. When tomatoes are grown outdoors, bees, birds, and the wind distribute their pollen and develop fruit. When you grow tomatoes indoors, you must simulate this process. You may achieve this by:\n\n\nDirecting a fan towards your plants to mimic the wind.\nTapping or shake the main stem of each plant gently with your finger.\nPollinating the plants by hand with a paintbrush or cotton swab. You can gently rub these on the flowers, distributing pollen to each. [12]",
                "Gather your harvest. Indeterminate tomatoes produce fruit within sixty to eighty days after planting. They will continue to produce fruit all season long. You will know that your tomatoes are ripe when they have turned a vibrant and even red, yellow, or pink. The tomatoes should be slightly soft when squeezed.\n\n\nTo pick the tomato, grasp it near its stem and twist it until it snaps off.[13]"

        "How to Do Physical Therapy Exercises for the Feet": {
            "intro": "The human foot is made of 26 bones and approximately 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It is also the part of the body that bears the most weight, so it is not uncommon to suffer from foot pain or diagnosed foot problems at some point in your life. Painful foot problems include bunions, pronation, fallen arches, hammertoes, plantar fasciitis and tight, cramping muscles. You can fix many of these problems by performing foot exercises to stretch the muscles and reduce tension.",
            "steps": [
                "Seek advice. If you are experiencing foot or ankle pain, you need to get advice from your doctor or podiatrist. If the pain does not go away, even with rest, ice, and elevation, you may have a fracture. This is even more likely if there is swelling, bruising, or discoloration. You will need to seek medical treatment and get an X-ray to confirm or rule out this possibility.\n\n\nIf you do have a fracture or other injury such as the ones mentioned above, ask your doctor if there are prescribed physical therapy exercises that you can do.[1]",
                "Try toe lifts. Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Lift your big toe up off the floor slightly while leaving the other four down. Practice this to the point where you can eventually raise up all five toes, one at the time, beginning with the big toe and ending with the fifth toe. Then practice lowering each toe one at a time, beginning with the fifth toe and ending with the big toe. Do two sets of 15.\n\n\nIf you find this difficult at first, just raise your big toe up and down until you get the hang of it. Move slowly through your toes, working up to where you can do all five.\nThis exercise is meant to strengthen the extenders, one of the groups of muscles which move the toes up and down. Strong extenders and flexors can help greatly with gait and balance and thus help prevent foot injuries from accidents, according to the Summit Medical Group.[2][3][4]",
                "Do toe curls. Place a towel on the ground under your right foot. Stretch your toes out and pull them back in to grip the material with your toes. Lift the cloth one to two inches off the ground and hold for five seconds. Lower it to the ground. Repeat five times. Then repeat on the left side.\n\n\nRelax your muscles between each grip.\nWork up to holding the grip for 10 seconds at a time.\nToe curls focus primarily on strengthening the toe flexors.",
                "Pick up marbles. Place 20 marbles and a small bowl on the ground. Sit on the couch or in a chair, relaxed all the way back. With one foot, pick up one marble at a time and place it in the bowl. Then empty the marbles out and do the same thing with your other foot. This exercise will strengthen the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles in the feet. It is also helpful for plantar fasciitis but also for injuries like turf toe, a term use for injury to the great toe caused by hyperextension.[5]\n[6]",
                "Write the alphabet. Sit on the couch, relaxed against the back. Extend one of your legs and raise one foot several inches off the ground. Trace the alphabet in the air using your big toe as a “pencil.” Then switch legs and do the same with the opposite big toe. This exercise helps to strengthen the extensor and flexor muscles in the foot.\n\n\nIt can also help with plantar fasciitis and turf toe, among other foot conditions. It is especially effective in ankle rehabilitation.\nKeep your movements small. Just use your ankle, foot, and toe.[7]",
                "Do a toe extension. Wrap a rubber band around the middle of all five of your toes on your right foot. It should have medium resistance so that it will give slightly. Stretch all of your toes apart. This will cause the band to stretch as far as it will go. Hold the stretch for five seconds and then relax your toes. Perform this stretch five times on each foot.\n\n\nMake sure to relax for approximately five seconds.\nThis strengthens the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the foot and is used in the treatment of both plantar fasciitis and turf toe.[8]",
                "Try a big toe pull. Loop the rubber band between the big toe on your right foot and the big toe on your left. Place your feet together. Pull your toes apart while trying to keep your ankles together. Stretch the rubber band as far as you can, then relax. Relax for five seconds in between stretches and repeat five times.\n\n\nThis exercise strengthens the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles in the feet.",
                "Do resistant ankle inversion. Sit on the floor with legs stretched out in front of you. Attach one end of a therapy band to a stationary object, such as the leg of a heavy table. The table should be beside you, down at your feet. Loop the other end of the band around the ball of your foot. The table leg will be off to the side. The loop of the band will wrap around the ball of your foot and extend out beside you toward the table. Using the band for resistance, move your ankle away from the table, pulling against the band to stretch it out.\n\n\nDo two sets of 15.\nThis exercise can help to strengthen the malleolus and tibialis muscles on either side of the ankle. It can also help prevent or treat sprains.[9]",
                "Perform resistant ankle eversion. This exercise is very similar to the inversion. Sit on the floor with legs stretched out in front of you. With the band in the same position as with the inversion, move the loop of the resistance band down so that it is against the arch of the foot instead of the ball. Move your foot up and out against the therapy band.\n\n\nDo two sets of 15.\nThis exercise can help to strengthen the peroneal and tibialis muscles on both sides of your ankle. It can also help treat or prevent sprains.[10]",
                "Do calf raises. Stand straight in front of a wall, counter, or other stable object. Place your hands gently on the wall in front of you. Raise yourself onto your toes in a calf raise exercise. From this raised-toe position, lower your feet to the ground again while keeping yourself balanced with your hands against the wall. Repeat 10 times, making sure to lower yourself slowly to the ground.\n\n\nFor an extra challenge, try raising yourself on 1 foot at a time, and doing 10 reps with each foot.[11][12][13]",
                "Test your ankle range of motion. Sit with your legs stretched straight out in front of you. Without moving legs, point your feet backward towards your body as far as they will comfortably go. Hold for 10 seconds. Then, point your toes down away from your body. Hold for 10 more seconds. Next, point toes towards the opposite foot and hold for 10 seconds. Then, point your toes away from the opposite foot and hold for 10 more seconds. Lastly, move the ankles 10 times clockwise and 10 times counterclockwise.\n\n\nThis exercise was developed by the Summit Medical Group, a rehabilitation center, to help increase the range of motion or flexibility of the ankles.\nAccording to Summit, increased flexibility and strength in the ankle muscles, especially the tibialis muscles, can help to greatly reduce injuries such as sprains.\nUse this series as a warm-up for the remaining stretching exercises.[14]",
                "Do plantar flexion. This stretch is similar to the warm up, but it is a more targeted stretch. Sit against the couch with your feet straight out in front of you, so that they are perpendicular to your legs. Flex your feet back towards you as far as they will go while keeping your legs flat on the ground. Try to keep your feet extended, so your toes and heels move in a straight line. Hold for five seconds. Relax and then push your toes away from the body as far as they will go.\n\n\nRepeat 15 times, moving both feet at the same time. You can also do this exercise while you are lying down.\nTo get a deeper stretch, you can use an elastic band.\nPointing the toes away from the body helps to strengthen the muscles in the calves.",
                "Try dorsiflexion. Sit in a chair and flex your right foot. Loop a large towel under your foot. Pull on the ends of the towel and pull it toward you. Stretch your toes towards you as far as you can while remaining comfortable. Hold stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times with each foot.\n\n\nThis stretches the muscles in the shins. Flexible shins, like calves, are important for full recovery from plantar fasciitis.\nYou can also do this with a resistance band on the floor. Hook the band around a table leg. Walk away from the table and loop your foot in the band. Bring your toes toward you, pulling against the band.[15]",
                "Do an Achilles stretch. Stand on a stair. Move until you are only standing on the stair with the balls of your feet. Hold onto the railings or wall on both sides for balance. Slowly lower your heel towards the step below you until you feel the stretching in the calf muscles. Hold this pose for 15-30 seconds, then relax. Do three reps.\n\n\nThis exercise helps stretch out the muscles of the calf. Calf muscle stretching, according to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society, is integral to the treatment of plantar fasciitis. This is because excessively tight calf muscles make it more difficult to properly flex and stretch the heel. This is necessary to help recover from this painful condition. [16][17]",
                "Perform a standing calf stretch. Stand facing the wall with hands resting on the wall for balance. Step forward with one leg and bend the knee slightly. Stretch the other leg behind you so that your heel is resting on the floor. Then, lean slowly into the wall until you feel the stretching in your calf. Hold for 15–30 seconds and do three reps.\n\n\nThis exercise stretches the soleus, one of the major muscles in the calf.[18].",
                "Stretch your toe flexors. Stand facing the wall, placing your hands on the wall for balance. Stretch your leg out behind you and point your foot, placing the top of your foot on the ground. Relax and feel the stretching in the ankle. Hold this pose for 15–30 seconds, stopping to rest for a moment if you feel any cramping in the toes. Do three reps on each foot.\n\n\nWork yourself up to holding the stance for one minute.\nThis is designed to stretch out the flexors muscles in the foot, which help you move the feet in relation to the leg.[19]",
                "Know the importance of massage. Doctors and clinics such as the Sports Injuries Clinic endorse foot massage. They are relaxing, but massages also increase circulation to the feet. They also help prevent injuries such as muscle strains or sprains.",
                "Perform a ball roll. Sit on a chair and place a tennis, lacrosse, or golf ball under the ball of your right foot (a tennis ball is probably the most comfortable for your foot). Roll the ball with your feet, moving the ball along the bottom of your foot from ball to heel. Continue the movement for two minutes. You should feel the massage throughout your foot.\n\n\nTry moving the ball up and down and in circles to increase the efficacy of the massage. Repeat on left foot for 2 minutes.[20]",
                "Give yourself a plantar fascia massage. While sitting on the chair, place your right foot on top of your left thigh. Use your thumb to gently work circles into your arch. Run your hands up and down your foot, releasing the muscles through the whole foot. Place your fingers between your toes as if you were holding hands with your feet. Keep this position with your toes spread for 30 seconds. Massage each toe to release extra tension.[21]"

        "wikiHow to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream": {
            "intro": "While dreaming, most people are not aware they are dreaming, and instead experience the dream as if it were real. However in a lucid dream, you can become aware that you are dreaming. Once you have this \"aha moment,\" you can learn to control the course of the dream and everything in it. There are infinite possibilities to what you can experience while dreaming, including flying, teleporting, shape-shifting, and anything else you can imagine. While some people can just jump into flight, for others it takes practice to master their new powers.",
            "steps": [
                "Practice awareness. To become aware that you are dreaming, you have to notice your environment and realize, \"This is just a dream.\" Some experts say that practicing awareness of your environment while awake can help you do to the same while sleeping.[1]\n\nDuring the day, look around and notice details like the heat of the sun or the feeling of pain when you stub your toe. With practice and attention, when you are dreaming you should be able to notice the absence or difference in these details, and realize you're dreaming. An additional perk to practicing mindfulness during the day, is it can make your dreams more realistic and easier to remember.",
                "Try meditation at night. Since lucid dreaming typically occurs during the REM sleep cycle, which happens toward the end of sleep or just before waking in the morning, some lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 4 hours after you go to bed at night, and then when you wake up, practicing meditation to enter a lucid dream state.[2]\n\nTurn off your alarm but try to stay as asleep as possible. Concentrate on the darkness on the back of your eyelids and on your intent to enter a dream state in which you are in control. Think about what you might want to dream about.[3]",
                "Try safe supplements. Some lucid dreamers use herbal supplements like choline or galantamine to induce a lucid dreaming state. These don't work for everyone, and sometimes can have adverse reactions like sleep paralysis, which is a state in which you are awake, but cannot move. (If this happens, stay calm and relax. If you are frightened, it only gets worse.) [4]\n\nIf you want to try choline or galantamine, try a small amount once a week. These herbs are available from health food stores in pill form. Some experienced lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 3 or 4 hours after you go to bed at night and taking the supplement then, to reduce the chances that you will experience sleep paralysis or nightmares.[5]\n\nAlthough some books and websites will encourage the use of off-label uses of prescription drugs or even illegal drugs to bring on lucid dreams, these are actually hallucinations and not lucid dreams, and can be dangerous. Some people have harmed themselves or others while using drugs.[6]",
                "Be careful as you learn. The definition of lucid dreaming is knowing that you are dreaming, but since lucid dreams typically feel very real, it is a good idea to test whether you are dreaming before trying anything dangerous like eating fire or jumping off of buildings.[7]\n\nTo test whether you are dreaming, do what is known as a \"reality check.\"[8] A reality check helps you ensure that you are actually dreaming. To perform a reality check while lucid dreaming, attempt to do something impossible but not dangerous like floating in the air. If you can do that, then you can advance to harder things that would be dangerous in real life.[9]",
                "Choose what you want to be. You have to clearly have a goal in mind so that you can focus on it. Concentrating on your goal in a sort of meditative practice helps you control your dream.\n\n\nYou can be anything, but many people enjoy becoming something that will allow you to experience the universe differently, like an alien, bird, or fish. You can also use shape-shifting to confront your fears: for instance, if you have a phobia of spiders, you can shape-shift into one and experience life from its point of view.[10]",
                "Use a mirror to shape-shift. A clear pond, window, or anything else that gives you a good reflection will also work.\n\n\nStare at yourself and will your skin to change and form into the shape you desire. You can also start at one end of your body (for instance, your feet) and consciously think of each part changing.\nSome lucid dreamers like to walk through the mirror at this point, fully embracing the alternate persona.[11]",
                "Act out your new shape. This is another method if you don't prefer to use a mirror or if you find it hard to visualize a mirror. Simply behave as if you were the thing you want to become. .\n\n\nFor example, if you want to shape-shift into a dog, go down onto your hands and knees. Start barking, and wag your tail. Pretty soon you'll feel your hands turn into paws and your face change.[12]",
                "Perform a reality check. This is to ensure your safety before you attempt flying. Even if you are confident you are dreaming, other conditions (like being high on drugs or sick with a very high fever) can induce a lucid dream-like state, so you need to be sure you're dreaming. [13]\n\nFloat up in the air or put one hand through a solid object before proceeding. As long as you can do this, you know you're dreaming and can move on.\nReality checks also have the added benefit of increasing your lucidity. The more you are able to control smaller behaviors, the more likely you will be to do bigger things like flying, which takes more mental focus.[14]",
                "Bounce around. Before flying, enjoy the landscape of the dream by bounce around, increasing your height with each bound. This gives you a safety net because your height is not that great.[15]\n\nDon't focus on the feeling of landing when you come down, just on the feelings of going up. Keep increasing the height and distance that you bounce.[16]",
                "Find a high place to jump off. While experienced lucid dreamers can often just float up into the air and start flying, one easy way for the beginner is to jump off something high. This will force your mind to decide that you can fly rather than fall.\n\n\nIf you have the ability and control, you can design your dreamscape with mountains or cliffs. Otherwise, you will have to explore your dreamscape to find a suitable place.",
                "Start running. If you're on a cliff, run towards the edge. If you're on a flat surface, you can still make it work; start running in a straight line, like an airplane taking off.\n\n\nWhen you reach the edge or decide you are ready, jump into flight like Superman. It helps to make it seem as realistic as possible, so put your arms out and point your toes behind you.",
                "Focus on details. Lucid dreaming is a lot like meditation and requires concentration and focus to keep it up. To keep yourself in flight, focus on the feeling of the air in your hair and the sensations of flying.\n\n\nIf you start to lose altitude, aim your body up and surge upwards, imagining a rocket propulsion coming from your toes.",
                "Don't look down until you feel comfortable with flying. Once you are steady, looking down at how high you are and how tiny everything below you is can be very enjoyable as long as you're not afraid of heights!\n\n\nIf you are afraid of heights, you have a couple of options: you can try to construct a version of yourself who is not afraid of heights (which can be helpful in overcoming your fear in real life[17]), or you can fly just above the ground, sort of like hovering.",
                "Remember that you're dreaming. If you do begin to fall, remind yourself that nothing you are seeing is real. It doesn't matter if you fall.\n\n\nSometimes, having this conscious thought is enough to steady your flight and help you stop falling.",
                "Fly like a bird. Some people find it easiest to fly by flapping their arms like a bird. Combine this with a jumping takeoff for the best results.\n\n\nYou can use each flap of your arms to propel you higher into the air. Change directions by shifting your whole body.",
                "Shape-shift into a flying creature. Another way to fly is by changing your physical body into a creature, made up or real, that can fly. Then you can use whatever method they use to fly. For example, shape-shift into a bird, and then simply flap your wings to go soaring through the air.\n\n\nYou can use a mirror method, discussed above, or simply envision yourself as a bird, bat, pterodactyl, airplane, or flying insect.",
                "Swim through the air. This is another method for flying and has the advantage of allowing you to dive into any bodies of water and swim.\n\n\nYou can use any swim stroke you are most comfortable with, and simply pick up your feet and begin the stroke to lift off.",
                "Use a flying aid. You can use a broomstick, flying carpet, or, if you prefer something more realistic, try a jetpack or helicopter.\n\n\nImagine yourself in or on the object that will help you fly, then allow it to lift off on its own and fly.[18]",
                "Use a gateway or portal. This technique involves using a door, mirror, or anything else as a gateway to a different location, planet, or universe.[19]\n\nConcentrate on the place you want to reach. Your dream is technically a land in your imagination, so imagine it as well as you can. Then simply open the door or walk through the mirror.\nIf you don't find yourself in the right place, try again or just explore where you are. The place you wanted might be right around the corner.",
                "Teleport without a gateway. Imagine in as much detail as possible, the place you want to go. Then, will your surroundings to blur and fade, and your new location to fill in the blanks.\n\n\nYou can also try spinning in place, knowing that when you stop, you will be in your desired location.",
                "Use other tricks to ease the teleportation. Close your eyes and decide that when you open them you will be in the right place (be wary of closing your eyes all the way because sometimes the dream will fade away and you will wake up).\n\n\nIf you can't teleport without a gateway, don't worry. It takes more time and practice without a gateway but you'll get it in time."

        "How to Make Moroccan Tea": {
            "intro": "Mint tea isn't just a drink in Morocco--it is a sign of hospitality, friendship, and tradition. Since this drink is so popular, it is served all day long, after every meal, and with every conversation. Moroccans take great pride in their tea and will often ask a visitor who among their group of friends makes the best cup of mint tea, and a minimum of two to three cups needs to be drunk so as not to offend the host.[1] Moroccan mint tea is a favorite among many people outside of Morocco, too, because of its smooth and sweet taste. It's served very sweet and made the old-fashioned way with gunpowder green tea.",
            "steps": [
                "Boil 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with 1 cup of water, and bring it to a boil on the stove over medium-high heat.[2]\n\nYou can prepare the full amount of water during this step, but you'll only use 1 cup (240 ml) when activating the tea leaves. The rest of the water may need to be reheated before use.\nNote that the water should be between 158°F and 176°F (70°c and 80°c).",
                "Warm the teapot. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of boiled water into the clean teapot. Swirl the water around slightly to rinse and warm the pot.[3]\n\nIf possible, try to use a Moroccan teapot. Moroccan teapots vary in size, but a small pot typically holds about a half liter (six glasses) of tea, while a larger pot holds approximately a liter (12 glasses); you can also use an ordinary teapot if you don't have a Moroccan one. Flameproof teapots are ideal when available.",
                "Add the loose gunpowder tea. Place the tea leaves in the tea pot. You'll need about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of loose gunpowder tea for every 6 oz (177ml) of hot water. If following the quantities noted in this recipe, add the full amount of leaves.\n\n\nChinese gunpowder tea is the most conventional, but if you are unable to find this tea, you could prepare a similar version of this drink using other loose green tea leaves or green tea bags. Use at least 2 tea bags for every 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of loose tea if choosing this option.[4]",
                "Pour in the remaining 3/4 cup (200 ml) of water. Add boiling water to the tea pot, directly over the tea leaves currently in the pot. Swirl the pot gently to warm, rinse, and activate the tea leaves.[5]",
                "Steep briefly. Allow the tea to steep in the hot water for about 30 seconds.[6] For a stronger flavor, you might consider letting it steep for as long as 1 or 2 minutes.",
                "Strain the water. Swirl the pot to wash and rinse the tea leaves, then carefully strain the water out through the spout of the tea pot, keeping the leaves in the pot.\n\n\nThe drained liquid is not Moroccan tea. This initial portion of water only rinses the leaves.\nSome tea pots have strainers in them; others do not. If your pot does not have its own strainer, make sure that you pour the contents through a separate strainer to collect the leaves and return them to the pot.",
                "Add the next ingredients to the teapot. This includes mint leaves and the sugar. Add them directly to the wet tea leaves in the pot.\n\n\nTry to find a Middle Eastern grocery store. Moroccan mint has a different taste than most other mints. If you are unable to find Moroccan mint, use any spearmint or peppermint.\nCane sugar is best. Dextrose will also work if you don't wish to use cane sugar, but you'll need to double the quantities of sugar to ensure sweetness.",
                "Fill the pot with the remaining water. If you boiled the water previously and it still feels hot enough, you can add it immediately. If not, boil the remaining 4 cups (1 L) before adding it to the pot.\n\n\nLeave the tea to steep for about 5 minutes.[7]\n\nIf you have a Moroccan teapot or a heatproof teapot, rather than steeping, set the teapot over low heat and bring the tea to a low simmer. Then, immediately remove from the heat, and allow to steep several minutes more.",
                "Pour one glass of tea. Pour it back into the teapot. Do this three or more times. This helps dissolve the sugar.[8]",
                "Pour the tea from a high distance. Doing this will help to create a thin layer of foam on the top. When pouring, make sure the tea pellets stay with the tea inside the pot. Only fill the cup two-thirds full; this enables the aroma to develop fully.",
                "Enjoy! After pouring the remaining tea, garnish the tea with extra mint (if available). This is an optional step but makes it look fantastic, especially if you have proper Moroccan glasses.[9]"

        "How to Wrap a Dog's Tail": {
            "intro": "There may come a time when your dog suffers from an injury known as “happy tail”. Contrary to the name, “happy tail” is anything but “happy”. Some dogs, especially large breeds with short hair, can injure his tail when wagging it.[1] Injury is sustained when the dog hits his tail against a hard surface or simply wags with such force that the tail ruptures. Follow these steps to help heal and protect your dog's tail after an injury.",
            "steps": [
                "Assess the tail. Before you wrap your dog's tail, look it over to make sure it actually needs a wrap. \"Happy tail\" will result in obvious blood loss from your dog's tail and you should be able to see where the site of the wound is.\n\n\nTry to contact your veterinarian. They will be able to wrap the tail and check for any other damage.\nIf you are unable to contact your veterinarian, you may have to wrap your dog's tail yourself.\nWrapping a dog's tail can help it to heal faster and prevent further injury.",
                "Learn the overview of wrapping your dogs tail. The wrap will be done in three basic stages, applying ointment and gauze, wrapping in cotton for padding, and then taping the bandage to secure everything in place.\n\n\nOintment goes directly on the wounded area. Clean the area first and then make sure you cover the entire injury with ointment.\nGauze and cotton should cover the injury as well. These layers help add protection and keep the ointment where it needs to be.\nTape will be applied in two ways. First, apply the tape lengthwise, down the dogs tail and over the gauze and cotton. Then apply rings around those first pieces of tape, starting at the tip and working down the tail.",
                "Gather the necessary materials. You will need a few key items to properly wrap your dog's tail. Getting items together before you begin will allow you to work faster when you apply the bandage and minimize discomfort for your dog.[2]\n\nAdhesive medical tape with a width of about one inch.\nAntibiotic ointment (Mycitracin/lidocaine).[3]\n\nCotton. Larger pieces of cotton will be easier to work with.\nOne non-stick gauze pad.",
                "Cut the adhesive tape into smaller pieces. You will want to pre-cut the tape in order to allow you to work quickly. The size of your dog's tail injury will vary, so you may need more or less tape to wrap the tail. However, you can cut about ten strips of the adhesive tape to the following sizes:[4]\n\nTwo long pieces (eight inches)\nSix short pieces (four inches)\nTwo half pieces (four inches in length, one half inch in width)",
                "Place the ointment. The ointment will help to prevent infection as well as promote healing. Ointment will need to be reapplied every time you change the bandage.\n\n\nPut ointment on the wound. Make sure you use enough to cover the injured area.\nYou may also want to put some ointment on the gauze bandage as well to ensure that it will come in contact with the wound.",
                "Cut and place a piece of the gauze bandage. Take the gauze bandage and cut out a piece that will be big enough to cover the size of the wound. Gently wrap the bandage around the wound and secure it with the narrow pieces of tape.[5]\n\nDon't tape or wrap anything too tightly.\nTry wrapping the tape down the tail in a spiral.\nYou can also try wrapping the adhesive tape around the tail, at each end of the bandage.\nMake sure the gauze covers the wound fully.",
                "Add the cotton. Take the cotton and place it around the wounded area of the tail. Make sure there is enough cotton to fully cover the area and provide enough padding to keep it from further injury.[6]\n\nIf you have a large piece of cotton, try wrapping it around the tail just like you would a bandage.\nWrap the cotton around the tail entirely at the site of the injury. The cotton should fully cover the gauze and provide padding to the injured area.\nCarefully compress the cotton, making it conform to the shape of the tail. Be careful not to compress the cotton too forcefully as you may cause further injury to the tail.",
                "Finish taping the tail. After you have the gauze bandage and cotton in place, you can start to tape them to the tail. The tape you are now adding will form the outside of the bandage as well as help to securely hold the gauze pad in place. These next pieces of tape will run lengthwise, down the dogs tail.[7]\n\nPlace an eight inch piece of tape lengthwise, parallel to the tail, over the cotton. The tape will start and end on the dog's fur.\nPlace a six inch piece of tape slightly askew of the first eight inch piece. It should start and end in the same places; however, it will be angled off to the right somewhat, covering the first piece only slightly.\nAdd another six inch piece of tape in the same way, expect this time angle it to the left.\nYou should have three pieces of tape now, covering the wound, lengthwise down the dog's tail. They should start and end in the fur, just past the ends of the gauze bandage.",
                "Add more tape. Now that you have the bandage anchored to the tail, it's time to add even more stability and protection. These next few pieces of tape will encircle the tail in rings, similar to the way a mummy is wrapped. Add the last few pieces of tape in the following way:[8]\n\nPut a piece of tape around the first three pieces and your dog's tail. Start towards the tip of your dog's tail and work down.\nAdd the next piece of tape, just below this one. It should go all the way around the dog's tail and cover the bandages and tape already affixed.\nKeep adding tape in this way until you have covered the length of the bandage.\nMake the last piece of tape overlaps the bandage, sticking to the fur of your dog's tail.",
                "Finish the bandage. Once you have covered the bandage with tape, you are almost done. These last few actions will fully affix the bandage to the tail and keep it secure.[9]\n\nPull a few bunches of hair out from underneath the last tape wrap.\nPlace these bunches of hair flat against the surface of the bandage.\nWrap one final piece of tape around these bunches of hair and the tail.",
                "Visit your vet. After you have applied the first bandage, you should visit your veterinarian as soon as you can. You will want to check to see the extent of the damage and how best to treat it.\n\n\nThere may be broken bones in the tail that need advanced treatment.\nYour vet may prescribe certain ointments or have alternative techniques for you to follow.\nThe dog may need stitches if the bleeding too profuse.",
                "Change the bandage as needed. The bandage will need changing as it will either become soiled, wet, fall off, or be destroyed by the dog chewing it. Apply new bandages as you did before to keep the wound healing, protected, and safe from infection or further damage.[10]\n\nDo not leave the bandage in place for more than a day.\nWet bandages will trap infections.\nMost tail problems will heal in two weeks\nVisit your veterinarian if the wound doesn't seem to be healing.",
                "Keep things calm. Happy tail results from your dog either wagging his tail so hard that it bleeds or hitting his tail on a hard surface. If you are able to lower the level of excitement in your dog, you will lower the chances of continued injury to your dog's tail.[11]\n\nIf your dog gets overly excited when you return home, ignore them, until you get to a larger room that he can wag his tail in without worry of them striking a hard surface.\nIf your dog gets excited about going on a walk, prepare for the walk in a larger room, giving them more space and avoiding any injury to his tail.\nTry to act calmly around your dog as this can result in calm behavior from them as well.\nTry using the “sit” command. By having your dog sit, it will reduce the amount of force that he can wag his tail with.[12]",
                "Remove the bandage. If the bandage needs to be on for more than a day, you will have to remove and change the bandage. Leaving a bandage on will increase the chances of infection and won't allow the tail to heal as well as it could. Remove the old bandage by using the following methods:[13]\n\nFor any areas of the bandage where the fur is stuck to the adhesive, try soaking them in vegetable or olive oil for a few minutes. These oils will help break down the adhesive and allow for easy removal.\nIf your dogs wound is healed, you can also try using shampoo to remove the adhesive and painlessly take the bandage off.\nFor small amounts of fur that are stuck to the bandage, you may simply cut the fur away with a pair of scissors. Exercise caution when cutting the bandage away as it is easy to accidentally cut the dogs tail. If you are not confident doing this, you could take your dog to the groomer.\nPulling the bandage off will also pull your dogs hair out and cause it pain. Avoid this method of removal as your dog will come to fear bandages.\nDo not use any harsh chemicals such as nail polish or rubbing alcohol as these can be harmful to your dog."

        "How to Build an Outdoor Turtle Enclosure": {
            "intro": "Building an outdoor enclosure for your turtle will take some time and planning. Once your enclosure is finished, your turtles will have a whole new area to explore and enjoy. An outdoor enclosure mimics a turtle’s environment more naturally and gives them access to the sunlight and vitamin D that they need to be healthy.",
            "steps": [
                "Keep the weather in mind. You should only build an outdoor enclosure for your turtle if you live in an area that is relatively warm year round. A good rule of thumb is to see whether your turtle breed is native to similar climates. For instance, if you have a box turtle it’s a good idea to make sure that box turtles are native to your area before you plan an outdoor enclosure.[1]",
                "Balance size with functionality. When it comes to outdoor enclosures, bigger is usually better though a larger size will generally require more maintenance.[2] The size of your yard, and the portion of your yard you’re willing to devote to the enclosure, will determine the size of your enclosure. Turtles do not grow to the size of their enclosure; their adult sizes are independent from the habitat they live in. You need to build a large enough enclosure for an adult turtle when you have a baby turtle.[3]\n\nYou will need to build a larger enclosure if you intend to house multiple turtles there. A suitable size enclosure for three or four relatively small turtles, like box turtles, should be five feet by five feet in size.[4]",
                "Choose a semi-shaded area. Turtles need direct sunlight both for their health and well-being. They also need a shaded area that they can retreat to whenever they feel the need to be out of the sun. Many people choose to build the enclosure next to their home or a shed, since this creates a shaded area for a portion of the day and acts as a fourth wall for the enclosure.[5]\n\nIf you do choose to build along the side of your home, east and south facing walls are ideal locations since they receive sunlight early in the morning. This way, turtles can warm up after the night and it will mimic the daylight they’d receive in the wild.",
                "Gather materials. This enclosure will be 8 feet by 8 feet in size. You can choose to enlarge this pen, or change the specifications to fit your needs. This will be an enclosure that will comfortably house three or four small to medium size turtles. Use pressure treated wood since it will last longer. You should not use wood that has been treated with arsenic. Timber that is treated with ACQ (Ammoniacal Copper Quat) is good, while CCA (Chromated Copper Arsenate) should be avoided. You can find what the wood has been treated with on a tag that should be stapled to each piece of timber.[6] For this portion of the project, you will need:\n\n\n8-foot-long landscaping timbers\n8-foot-long two-by-fours\n3-foot-tall stakes.\n2-foot-long two-by-two lumber\nA box of nails for wood\nHammer\nMeasuring tape\nShovel\n8 foot by 8 foot section of wire mesh",
                "Clear and mark the area. Clear any debris out of the area so you have a clean space to work. Use a measuring tape and some wooden stakes to mark out the area. This will be a square shaped pen.",
                "Dig a trench at least one foot deep around the perimeter. You need to dig a trench so you can put the walls down into the ground. Turtles are skilled diggers and can easily escape the enclosure if the walls are not deep enough.[7]",
                "Lay out the base timbers and attach corner supports. With your trench dug, you will place one 8-foot-long landscaping timber into the each eight-foot long ditch. This will create a square shape, and the first part of your support wall. You will use the 2-foot-long two-by-two pieces of lumber to attach the walls at the corners.\n\n\nUse the hammer to nail each corner together. The four corners should meet and be secure.",
                "Add height to the walls. Now that you have the corner supports attached, they will be significantly taller than the 8-foot-long landscaping timbers which are only a few inches tall when they are laid in the trenches. Using the 8-foot-long two-by-fours you will add height to the walls by nailing a two-by-four along each side to the two-by-two stakes. This will stack the timbers on top of each other and give height to the wall.\n\n\nYou can make the wall as tall as you’d like. The minimum height should be twice as high as the adult length of a turtle. So if you have turtles that reach 10” once they are mature, your wall should be at least 20” high. This ensures that your turtles can’t crawl over the walls and escape.\nTurtles don’t fully grasp the concept of walls and when they are able to see out of the enclosure, like through wire mesh, they may spend their time pushing against the barrier, hoping to escape. A wooden barrier, at least as tall as the turtle’s height, prevents this problem.[8]",
                "Use wire mesh to cover the enclosure. An outdoor enclosure needs to let sunlight in but not any predators hoping to grab your turtle. Wire mesh is a good barrier since it allows sunlight and rain to fall through while still offering protection.[9] nail the wire mesh directly to the top of the enclosure, but be sure to leave a corner accessible so you can put food and water into the enclosure.\n\n\nYou can also build a removable top to the enclosure, but this will take more time and additional materials.",
                "Plan a habitat. The ideal enclosure replicates their natural environment as closely as possible. However, the goal of the enclosure is to keep your turtles in and predators out so it won’t be able to completely mimic their natural habitat. Keep in mind that both aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles need a water and a land area.[10]",
                "Plant turtle friendly plants. Plants are a great way to add hiding and sleeping areas for your turtles. It will also help to mimic their natural habitat, and make the enclosure more aesthetically pleasing. The types of plants you decide to add will depend on your climate, but make sure every plant is safe and non-toxic for turtles.[11] You can keep the ground covered in grass, or you can add a substrate like mulch.\n\n\nSome edible plants for your turtles include hibiscus, roses, geraniums, dandelions, mulberry trees, and pansies.[12]\n\nDo not use pesticides in your turtle enclosure.[13]",
                "Add rocks and logs. Turtles are cold blooded, so they need a place where they can bask in the sun and soak up its rays. They enjoy having logs, sticks, and rocks to climb over and then flatter stones or logs to rest and bask on. You can collect a variety of logs and stones to help your turtles feel at home.",
                "Determine the size of your water feature. All land and semi-aquatic turtles need a supply of clean, fresh water in their habitat. By creating a small pond, you provide your turtles with the water they need to swim, bathe, and drink. The size of your pond will depend on the number of turtles you want to have in the enclosure, and the space available. Pools should be large enough for turtles to exercise and move about freely. Take their adult length and multiple that number by 2.5; this is the minimum depth you’ll want the water to be. The length of the pool should be at least five times as large as their adult length. This gives them room to swim around and bask.[14]\n\nFor ponds with multiple turtles, you need a larger pond. Smaller ponds accumulate waste and cannot be properly cleaned.[15]\n\nFor land turtles, you want to create a shallow pond that is no deeper than a foot in the middle. The pond should have gently sloping sides so turtles can enter and exit the water easily.",
                "Choose a semi-shaded area. Direct sunlight can cause a small pond to heat to an unsafe temperature, and causes unwanted algae growth.[16] Ideally, you want an area that is has both shade and sun coverage during all times of day. Putting the pond alongside your house or a shed will provide sun coverage for several hours a day as well.",
                "Dig a shallow pool. When you’ve decided where you’d like the water feature to go, you can start to dig. It can be whatever shape you’d like, and the depth will depend on the sort of turtle you have. Red-eared sliders do better in deeper ponds, while others prefer shallower water. Research the type of water your turtle species inhabits in the wild to get a good idea of how deep your pond should be.[17]\n\nIf you intend to have your aquatic turtles hibernate outdoors during the winter, the pool will need at least a foot of water below the ice to hibernate. Check your local area’s weather to see how thick the ice is in local ponds.",
                "Lay down a pool liner. You can purchase a pool liner online, from a large retailer, or from an outdoor good store. The liner will keep the water from seeping into the ground, which would become a big muddy mess. You will need to follow the manufacturer’s directions for the pool liner.\n\n\nA concrete pool will last longer, but is a more complicated process to undergo. If you prefer to use a waterproof tarp, choose tan or canvas colored tarps instead of black. Black tarps absorb the sunlight and can overheat small pools.[18]",
                "Fill the pond with water. Using a hose, you can now fill the pond with water.",
                "Place logs around the pond. Logs should be placed around the pond so that some can extend into the water. These help the turtles get in and out of the water, and it also provides them with a place to bask. Logs help to mimic the turtle’s natural habitats, and it also serves a decorative function.[19]"

            "intro": "Perhaps it's always been your lifelong dream, or you just recently discovered your love for this country. Either way, you want to move to England. Unless you are a citizen of a European country, the requirements can be quite strict. This article will help you through the visa process, housing search, and more.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn about visas. The UK Government website has an easy online form that will tell you what type of visa you need. Check it out here. Most immigrants will need a visa of some kind, allowing them to live and possibly work in the UK for a certain amount of time. Once you know which type to apply for, get started at visa4uk.fco.gov.uk. It's best to allow several months for your visa to get approved.\n\n\nIf you need more information, the rest of this section explains the immigration and travel requirements in detail. Otherwise, skip ahead to the next section.\nThe United Kingdom is the state made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. You do not need a visa specific to England or any other jurisdiction of the UK.",
                "Know the rights of European citizens. If you are a citizen of any country in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom. This includes all countries in the European Union, plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway. Citizens of Switzerland also have this right. However, the referendum held on continuing EU membership on 23 June 2016, which resulted in the British electorate voting to leave the European Union (51.8% in favour) could lead to the EU freedom of movement rules being no longer valid in the next few years.[1]\n\nAll you need is a passport to prove your citizenship. While not required, you may also want to apply for a registration certificate. This may help you prove your rights when applying for various benefits.[2]\n\nFamily members of European citizens who are not themselves citizens must still apply for a visa. They can apply for permanent residency after the citizen family member has worked in the UK for five years.[3]",
                "Apply for UK jobs. Search at monster.co.uk, fish4.co.uk, reed.co.uk, or indeed.co.uk. If a UK company wants to hire you, you can apply for a visa. How long this lets you stay depends on your job:[4]\n\nTier 2 visas are available for high-demand fields, listed in detail here. You may also have a chance if you are transferring within a multinational company, or if your employer can demonstrate that your job cannot be filled by a local worker. These usually allow three years of residency, extendable to six.\nTier 5 visas are temporary work permits good for 6 months to 2 years. If you are not qualified for a Tier 2 position, look for work in a charity organization, or work as an athlete, entertainer, or religious worker.\nTier 1 visas are only available to people starting a business, making multimillion pound investments, or recognized as leaders in their field. They're typically good for five years and can be extended to ten.",
                "Enroll as a student at a UK institution. You must be able to speak the English language and have enough money to support yourself.[5] You can stay until you complete the course, plus a few months. You will only be able to work in jobs required by your coursework.[6]",
                "Apply for other visas. There are a few other ways to enter the UK for more than a short tourist visit. These require special circumstances, most commonly the following:\n\n\nFamily (variable length and work status): Available if joining a spouse, fiancé(e), partner of two+ years, or child. Also available if you need to be cared for by a family member in the UK.[7][8]\n\nUK ancestry visa (5 years, can work): Must be a Commonwealth citizen with a grandparent born in the UK.[9]\n\nTier 5 Youth Mobility (2 years, can work): citizen of certain countries, between 18 and 30.[10]\n\nVisitor visa (usually 6 months, can't work): A last resort. If you have the money to support yourself while waiting, you can arrive on a visitor visa, then try to get hired and apply for a work permit. The odds are slim, but you get a holiday if it doesn't work out.",
                "Find a place to live. Look for a hostel or hotel you can stay in temporarily when you arrive, and for potential living situations. You may need to wait until you arrive to sign a contract, but start looking a few weeks in advance for rentals, or a few months if buying. Try sites such as Gumtree, RightMove, Zoopla, or RoomMatesUK. Make sure you know how the property search may differ from your country:\n\n\nLondon property prices are very expensive, averaging £1,900/month for a two-bedroom flat (apartment).[11] Consider other cities, or country towns within an hour of a city.\nLook closely — the listed rental price may be either weekly or monthly. Feel free to negotiate over the price.[12]\n\nIf you plan to buy a house, hire a real estate solicitor in the UK first.[13]",
                "Check for housing-related fees. Before you sign a rental contract, ask which additional fees you will be paying. The cost varies greatly depending on your region and property, but here are some estimates:[14]\n\nUtilities: Expect to pay about £120 a month for water and electricity, plus £70 for heating. This is the average cost over a year; heating costs are much higher during winter, and lower during the summer months.\nCouncil tax: at least £100 per month, but could potentially be higher.\nTelevision licence: In order to watch live BBC channels (even online), you need to pay a colour TV licence fee of £145.50 each year. This can be paid in a full lump sum, or in smaller amounts throughout the year. Though rarer nowadays, a licence for a black and white TV costs £49. It is a criminal offence to view TV programming without paying the licence fee, and you could be fined up to £1,000.[15]\n\nTelevision, mobile, and Internet plans vary widely. This is in addition to the licence fee.",
                "Practice your English. If English is not your native language, start studying before you arrive. Life will be much easier if you can speak, read, and write in English. If you come from the United States, learn British English, as American English and British English have different words for many things. For example, the hood of a car is a \"bonnet\". It may also be a requirement for some jobs, or for applying to become a permanent resident.",
                "Plan to move your pet. First, check here to find out whether your country is \"listed\" or \"unlisted,\" and for special requirements by country and species. For cats, dogs, and ferrets coming from most areas, you need the following:[16]\n\nmicrochip\nrabies vaccination (21+ days in advance)\nEU pet passport or third country veterinary certificate (a veterinarian can help with this)\nDogs only: tapeworm treatment\nUnlisted countries only: Blood test (3+ months in advance, 30 days+ after rabies vaccine)\nApproved travel route and transport agency, listed here. If traveling from a hot climate, you may need to wait for cooler weather.",
                "Budget your expenses. Cost of living varies depending on your location. Use expatistan.com to compare your current location to your new home.\n\n\nIf you stay in the UK more than 183 days, you will owe taxes on your income.[17]",
                "Figure out transportation. Public transportation is reliable in London and most other large cities, while parking and petrol prices are challenging. If you do decide to drive, click here to find out whether you can use your current licence.\n\n\nRail travel is common for longer journeys, with price and speed ranging from convenient to absurd depending on the route. If you plan on traveling and are aged over 60 or under-25, buy a discount railcard.\nIn London, buy an Oyster Card from a Underground (tube) station. These give discounted prices on tube, bus, and city rail fares.",
                "Open a new bank account. A bank account and associated debit/credit card are usually free. A few of the largest English banks are: Lloyds, HSBC, Barclay's, and NatWest.\n\n\nAsk your current bank whether it has a \"sister bank\" program you can use while in the UK.\nYou can try opening a bank account from overseas, but you may need to provide a UK address.",
                "Apply for documents. There are a couple useful documents a visitor to the UK should have:\n\n\nNational Insurance Number. This is used for tax purposes, and required for employment and to claim any benefits. Call Jobcentre at 0345 600 0643 to apply.[18]\n\nPassport photo (with UK specifications). These can be taken at photo booths for £6 or less.",
                "Learn about the UK healthcare system. Emergency medical care is free at-point-of-use for all visitors. Hospital visits are free to most visitors, including anyone who paid a one-time healthcare surcharge when applying.[19] For other health-related issues, it's up to the doctor whether to charge you or not.[20] You may want to ask several doctors in your area about prices before you choose one.",
                "You may want to also learn some of the differences between English culture and the culture you came from so you don't get confused! Although this may seem like something you can just get used to, it's good to figure out the English version of some words, or you might end up saying the wrong word and getting in trouble! For example: in England, \"fanny\" is much more vulgar and socially unacceptable word in England than it is in the USA; as it means something else."

            "intro": "Sleeping on hair all night tends to create a bit of a mess by morning, especially if you've tossed and turned. And for those who have hair that tangles and knots with great ease, the overnight sleep can truly cause hair disaster. Never fear, taming messy morning hair is definitely doable, both before sleep and after.",
            "steps": [
                "Try taming your hair before sleeping. For those with medium to long hair, this might mean braiding your hair or tying it back so that it doesn't have a chance to travel around your head during sleep. You could also consider adding some leave-in conditioner for keeping the hair in better shape.\n\n\nHair can be be braided damp or dry. If you braid it when damp, you will have wavy hair in the morning.",
                "Sleep on satin pillowcases. These can help to keep your hair smooth and less frizzed up. It's not essential but a nice touch if you like satin.",
                "Wrap the head before sleeping. If you don't like braiding or wearing the hair in a ponytail, wrapping is another option. Use a thin summer weight scarf or a bandanna to wind your hair into place. Ensure that the hair does not move before tying a knot at the front of your head. Don't tie the knot on the back or side, as you don't want to lie on the knot.\n\n\nUsing a toweling cap is another option in place of a scarf. The cap should have firm but not tight elastic.",
                "Select a sleeping position that is most comfortable. With some luck, this can help to minimize overnight movement but there are no guarantees, as moving about during the night is normal.",
                "Brush or comb your hair when you get up in the morning. While self-evident, it's an important start to taming the mess. If you have problems getting the hair brushed or combed, use spray-in conditioner to ease the knots and tangles out.\n\n\nGive each section of hair five to ten brushstrokes.\nIf you plan on wearing your hair down, finish up with a little hair gel or a touch of hairspray. That will keep the flyaways at bay.",
                "Avoid using heat where possible. It's a vicious cycle––you add heat to try to get the hair into good condition, only to find it dries and gets flyaway, then add more heat to tame that, and so on. If you must use heat, always use heat protectant on your hair as well.",
                "Go with the flow. If the hair likes messy, then use messy updos to keep things looking fashionable while staying natural to your hair's preferred appearance. Some possibilities include:\n\n\n\nMessy braids or plaits\nMessy buns\nBeach waves\nHipster bedhead look plus glasses (with the added bonus you don't need to try, it already is messy)\n\nMessy updos.",

        "How to Use an Abacus": {
            "intro": "The abacus (the suanpan is the most useful variety) is a deceptively simple calculating tool still used all over the world. It's a useful learning device for the visually impaired, as well as for anyone who wants to learn the roots of the modern calculator. After learning the basics of counting on the abacus, you can quickly perform arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
            "steps": [
                "Orient your abacus properly. Each column in the top row should have one or two beads per row, while each column in the bottom row should have four. When you start, all of the beads should be up in the top row, and down in the bottom row. The beads in the top row represent the number value 5 and each bead in the bottom row represents the number value 1.[1]",
                "Assign each column a place value. As on a modern calculator, each column of beads represents a \"place\" value from which you build a numeral. So, the farthest column on the right would be the \"ones\" place (1-9), the second farthest the \"tens\" place (10-99), the third farthest the hundreds (100-999), and so on.[2]\n\nYou can also assign some columns to be decimal places if necessary.\nFor example, if you are representing a number like 10.5, then the furthest right column would be the tenths place (the first decimal place), the second column would be the ones place, and the third column the tens place.\nLikewise, to represent a number like 10.25, the furthest right column would be the hundredths place, the second column would be the tenths place, the third the ones place, and the fourth the tens place.",
                "Start counting with the beads in the lower row. To count a digit, push one bead to the \"up\" position. \"One\" would be represented by pushing a single bead from the bottom row in the farthest column on the right to the \"up\" position, \"two\" by pushing two, etc.[3]\n\nYou'll find it easiest to use your thumb to move the beads in the top row, and your index finger to move the beads in the bottom row.",
                "Complete the \"4/5 exchange.” Since there are only four beads on the bottom row, to go from \"four\" to \"five,\" you push the bead on the top row to the \"down\" position and push all four beads from the bottom row down. The abacus at this position is correctly read \"five.\" To count \"six,\" push one bead from the bottom row up, so the bead in the top row is down (representing a value of 5) and one bead from the bottom row is up.[4]",
                "Repeat the pattern for higher numbers. The process is essentially the same across the abacus. Go from \"nine,\" in which all the beads in the ones place are pushed up and the bead in the top row is pushed down, to \"ten,\" in which a single bead from the bottom row of the tens place is pushed up (while the beads in the ones place are pushed back to their starting or \"0\" position).\n\n\nFor example, 11 would have one bead in the second column pushed up, and another in the first column pushed up, all on the bottom row. Twelve would have one in the second column and two in the first column, all pushed up, and all on the bottom row.\nTwo hundred and twenty six would have two in the third column pushed up in the bottom row, and two in the second column pushed up in the bottom row. In the first column, one bead on the bottom row would be pushed up, and the bead on the top row would be pushed down.",
                "Input your first number. Say you've got to add 1234 and 5678. Enter 1234 on the abacus by pushing up four beads in the ones place, three in the tens place, two in the hundreds place, and one in the thousands place.[5]",
                "Start adding from the left. The first numbers you'll add are the 1 and the 5 from the thousands place, in this case moving the single bead from the top row of that column down to add the 5, and leaving the lower bead up for a total of 6. Likewise, to add 6 in the hundreds place, move the top bead in the hundreds place down and one bead from the bottom row up to get a total of 8.",
                "Complete an exchange. Since adding the two numbers in the tens place will result in 10, you'll carry over a 1 to the hundred place, making it a 9 in that column. Next, put all the beads down in the tens place, leaving it zero.\n\n\nIn the ones column, you'll do essentially the same thing. Eight plus 4 equals 12, so you'll carry the one over to the tens place, making it 1. This leaves you with 2 in the ones place.",
                "Count your beads to get the answer. You're left with a 6 in the thousands column, a 9 in the hundreds, a 1 in the tens, and a 2 in the ones: 1,234 + 5,678 = 6,912.",
                "Subtract by doing the addition process in reverse. Borrow digits from the previous column instead of carrying them over. Say you're subtracting 867 from 932. After entering 932 into the abacus, start subtracting column-by-column starting on your left.\n\n\nEight from nine is one, so you'll leave a single bead up in the hundreds place.\nIn the tens place, you can't subtract 6 from 3, so you'll borrow the 1 in the hundreds place (leaving it zero) and subtract 6 from 13, making it 7 in the tens place (the upper bead up and two lower beads).\nDo the same thing in the ones place, \"borrowing\" a bead from the tens place (making it 6) to subtract 7 from 12 instead of 2.\nThere should be a 5 in the ones column: 932 - 867 = 65.",
                "Record the problem on the abacus. Start at the farthest left column of the abacus. Say you're multiplying 34 and 12. You need to assign columns to \"3\", \"4\", \"X\", \"1\", \"2\", and \"=\". Leave the rest of the columns to the right open for your product.[6]\n\nThe “X” and “=” will be represented by blank columns.\nThe abacus should have 3 beads up in the farthest column left, four up in the next farthest, a blank column, a column with one bead up, two beads up in the next, and another blank column. The rest of the columns are open.",
                "Multiply by alternating columns. The order here is critical. You need to multiply the first column by the first column after the break, then the first column by the second column after the break. Next, you'll multiply the second column before the break by the first column after the break, then the second column before the break by the second column after the break.[7]\n\nIf you are multiplying larger numbers, keep the same pattern: start with the leftmost digits, and work to the right.",
                "Record the products in the correct order. Start recording in the first answer column, after the blank one for the “=” sign. You will keep moving beads on the right hand portion of the abacus as you multiply the individual digits. For the problem 34 x 12:[8]\n\nFirst, multiply 3 and 1, recording their product in the first answer column. Push three beads up in that seventh column.\nNext, multiply the 3 and the 2, recording their product in the eighth column. Push one bead from the upper section down, and one bead from the lower section up.\nWhen you multiply the 4 and the 1, add that product (4) to the eighth column, the second of the answer columns. Since you're adding a 4 to a 6 in that column, carry one bead over to the first answer column, making a 4 in the seventh column (four beads from the bottom section pushed up to center bar) and a 0 in the eighth (all beads in their original starting position: the top section bead pushed up, bottom section beads pushed down).\nRecord the product of the last two digits 4 and 2 (8), in the last of the answer columns. They should now read 4, blank, and 8, making your answer 408.",
                "Leave space for your answer to the right of the divisor and the dividend. When dividing on an abacus, you will put the divisor in the left-most column(s). Leave a couple blank columns to the right, then put the dividend in the columns next to those. The remaining columns to the right will be used to do the work leading to the answer. Leave those blank for now.[9]\n\nFor example, to divide 34 by 2, count 2 in the left-most column, leave two blank columns, then put 34 over to the right. Leave the other columns blank for the answer section.\nTo do this, push two lower beads from the bottom portion up in the left-most column. Leave the next two columns alone. In the fourth column, push three beads from the bottom portion up. In the fifth column from the left, push four beads from the bottom portion up.\nThe blank columns between the divisor and the dividend are just to visually separate the numbers so you don't lose track of what's what.",
                "Record the quotient. Divide the first number in the dividend (3) by the divisor (2), and put it in the first blank column in the answer section. Two goes into 3 once, so record a 1 there.\n\nTo do this, push one bead from the bottom portion up in the first column of the answer section.\nIf you like, you can skip a column (leave it blank) between the dividend and the columns you want to use for the answer section. This can help you distinguish between the dividend and the work you do as you calculate.",
                "Determine the remainder. Next, you need to multiply the quotient in the first answer section column (1) by the dividend in column one (2) to determine the remainder. This product (2) needs to be subtracted from the first column of the dividend. The dividend should now read 14.\n\nTo make the dividend read 14, push two of the bottom portion beads currently pushed up to the center bar at the fifth column back down to their starting position. Only one bead in the lower portion of the fifth column should remain pushed up to the center bar.",
                "Repeat the process. Record the next digit of the quotient in the next blank column of the answer section, subtracting the product from the dividend (here, eliminating it). Your board should now read 2, followed by blank columns, then 1, 7, showing your divisor and the quotient, 17.\n\nTwo beads from the bottom portion of the left most column will be pushed up to the center bar.\nThis will be followed by several blank columns.\nOne bead from the bottom portion of the first answer section column will be pushed to the center bar.\nIn the next answer section column, two beads from the bottom portion will be pushed up to the center bar, and the bead from the top portion will be pushed down to it."

From this point, it will continue to grow until it's strong enough to plant in the garden.",

Ensure that you will live in the same place for a long enough time to make the tree old enough and beautiful enough that no new buyers of the house will chop down the tree or think it's a weed and pull it out. If you must move, make sure the tree is at least healthy before the buyer sees it, as an inherited diseased tree is often not worth the trouble for whoever gets it and will be cut.\n\n\nBy the way, when the seedlings are in large pots, place them outside in the pots as the seedlings grow to strengthen the plants and acclimate them to the outdoor weather. This allows you to bring inside the young trees and care for them extra/overwinter them whenever you think they need it, and then move them outside again.",

        "wikiHow to Write a Dissertation": {
            "intro": "A document that presents the author's research and findings and is submitted in support of candidature for a degree or professional qualification is called dissertation or thesis. The term \"thesis\" is usually used for Ph.D. (doctoral) or M.Phil. level degree in UK.",
            "steps": [
                "Build academic and language skills. Before you can start writing a dissertation, you will need to have developed your skills to a point where you will be able to write a dissertation. This high level of academic work requires exquisitely honed language skills, as well as the ability to analyze and process information at a level appropriate for original research. Make sure that your skills are up to the task before beginning, otherwise you may not be able to complete the dissertation and you will certainly cause yourself a great deal of stress.\n\n\nMany programs require that you are not only very capable of speaking your own language but another or several others as well. This can span from other modern spoken languages (like French, German, or Mandarin) to dead spoken languages (such as Latin or Greek) to non-spoken languages (such as programming languages).\nYou will need to be excellent at tracking down information, processing it, understanding where information is missing, and finding solutions to the problems that those holes present. This is often much more difficult than it sounds.\nYou will also need to have developed writing skills which will be conducive to producing a dissertation. These documents are often as long as books, being anywhere between 30,000-100,000 words. It is difficult to write something so long, in-depth, and descriptive.",
                "Build time management skills. Writing such a complex document while often still taking classes, working as a teacher’s or lab assistant or teaching undergraduate classes can be challenging at best. There is a reason that there are so many jokes about how grad students never get to sleep. You should relax and sleep every now and again, because the stress is not good for you or your work, but in order to fit everything in you’ll need to be very good at knowing how to balance all of these activities.\n\n\nTry to set aside time when it is impossible or incredibly difficult to work in order to relax. For example, listen to audiobooks or podcasts while you drive to school. You can catch up on your favorite websites using your phone, laptop, or tablet while you eat lunch and dinner. Exercise while waiting for search or test results (you’d be surprised how much energy you’ll get from doing a few squats!).\nSleep on a regular schedule. This will be incredibly challenging at times, but sleeping on a regular schedule (even if it’s a little less sleep than you might normally get) will make you feel more energized and focused than sleeping longer hours irregularly.\nUse browser add-ons like StayFocused. You’ll be thankful later.",
                "Learn to cope with stress. If you can’t cope well with stress, you will have a very difficult time with graduate school in general and an even harder time with writing a dissertation. Learn to manage your stress and release it in a healthy and effective manner before starting on a dissertation.\n\n\nGood ways for grad students to ease stress are to exercise, listen to music, or watch a funny video. All of these are easily fit into complex schedules. What you’ll want to avoid as a grad student, however, are stress-reducing activities like watching TV (which will suck up large blocks of time and stress you out more) or eating (which will likely make you gain a great deal of weight).",
                "Understand the purpose of a dissertation. When you begin your dissertation, it is important to understand the purpose it is meant to serve. In understanding the larger goal of the exercise, you can more carefully craft your paper to demonstrate that you have achieved said goal and are deserving of those coveted post or pre-name letters.\n\n\nA dissertation will prove your ability to produce original research with original, impactful ideas. One of the main things you will be expected to do after getting your advanced degree is furthering your field by producing new ideas which solve the problems previously present in the discipline. You will need to prove that you are capable of making these significant contributions and your dissertation will be your first major step.\nA dissertation will demonstrate your knowledge of research design. You will need to show that you can perform research in a way that is acceptable for your discipline. This means coming up with tests that properly correspond with your hypothesis, accounting for variables, and accurate methods of collecting data, among other things.",
                "Consider if this is right for you. A life of serious academic work is not for everybody. While for some people it will bring great joy, others will feel unfilled. Because of the amount of work involved and the stress that comes with it, you will want to be sure that this is really what you want for your life.\n\n\nPeople are often goaded into pursuing higher degrees by their parents, who generally just want what they feel is best for their child. However, this may not be what’s best. If your parents have pushed you into this, you will need to seriously consider if your parent’s wishes should guide your life decisions. It is your choice, in the end. Not theirs.\nThere is no shame in choosing not to pursue this degree. As already discussed, not everyone is suited to the life it will bring. It also should not be considered a waste of time or money, as the additional training is often not only useful but still looks good to many employers.",
                "Decide your topic. Before you begin, you will need to decide on a topic that is right for you. Remember, you will be working on this for a very long time. It needs to be something that you find interesting or you will have a very unpleasant time. Your thesis for the topic must also be a significant contribution to the scholarship, so try to avoid topics that are well researched already. It also needs to be something that you feel you have enough ability to prove and support.\n\n\nFor example, you will not be able to write a historical dissertation on aliens building the pyramids. Or at least, not one that you’ll get past your committee. A dissertation on guano curing cancer is going to end similarly. Try to choose something that won’t lead your university to disown you.",
                "Get funding. Before you begin, try to find sources of funding. You will need to be able to support yourself (just in terms of living conditions), because working while writing a dissertation is at the very least extremely challenging, if not outright barred by your program. You may also need funds in order to pursue research, either for traveling to collect or view materials, for purchasing rare or expensive texts, or to pay for materials necessary to conduct experiments.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to get this funding. Asking your department for advice will probably be best, since funding is often specific to discipline. Generally, seek grants rather than loans. Fellowships from your university are also extremely helpful. Many schools will have scholarships and grants specifically set aside for those beginning work on their dissertation.",
                "Create a space where you can work. You will need to be able to focus while writing your dissertation. This means having a space where you can have quiet and will not be constantly bombarded by distractions. You will need to also have easy access to everything that you need for writing: books, a computer, internet connection, power sources, etc. Be sure that you've secured this before beginning work.",
                "Understand your adviser. Your adviser will be your guide along this perilous journey, the Virgil to your Dante. Be sure that you get along with and understand your adviser, preferably before starting work. Being unable to communicate complex ideas with this person will make it very difficult to proceed. You should both have a thorough understanding of what you’re trying to do and what your advisor expects from you.",
                "Prepare for your committee. Understand the people who will be on your committee. Know what their areas of expertise are, as well as areas where their knowledge is lacking. This will influence how you write your content. You will also want to know what types of research and evidence they value vs. which they hate. If there are particular methods that they do not approve of but that you intend to use, you will need to be prepared to defend yourself and your choices.",
                "Think about your colleagues. Since this work is intended as your first foray into the academic world, you will need to think of your future colleagues as you write it. Is the topic you have chosen something which is largely disapproved of in your discipline? This will make it hard to integrate into the community once you graduate and you will need your peers to think well of you if you want to get a job.",
                "Consider general readers. Dissertations, since they are legitimate research, will hopefully be used by future scholars in their own research and learning process. With this in mind, try to write your dissertation in a way that will be as accessible and understandable as possible.",
                "Plan your structure. Plan the structure of your dissertation according to the standards of your discipline. You will definitely want to outline your paper before beginning. The more detailed it is, the easier it will be for you later on. This outline will be an invaluable road-map and should not be ignored or discounted.\n\n\nGenerally, it will follow the same basic form as shorter research papers, beginning with an introduction to the topic, giving some background, presenting research by previous scholars, presenting your own evidence, combating evidence which does not fit or contradicts you, and then wrapping up. There will usually be a discussion of your methods, but where that goes and to what extent it is integrated into other sections will depend heavily on your discipline.",
                "Get feedback. Before beginning too much writing, you will want to get feedback from your peers and advisers. Show them the structure you have planned and give them an overview of your research and evidence. Their feedback will allow you to see where you have neglected information or made too many logical leaps. They will help you to ensure that your evidence is presented in the best way and that your conclusions make sense.",
                "Minimize unnecessary depth and breadth. Before getting too deep into your dissertation, analyze your topic and thesis to see if there are any ways in which you can limit the scope of your paper. Is there information or discussions which are unnecessary to proving your thesis? Remove anything from your research that does not serve a purpose, as such extras can result in having to write pages upon pages of unnecessary text. Keep it reasonable and you’ll save yourself a lot of time and stress.\n\n\nThis is another area where you can make use of feedback, especially from your adviser.\nTo consider the problem yourself, run down a list of your evidence and every point in your outline. If it doesn't directly tie back to your thesis, or if another section or point proves the same thing, consider cutting it.",
                "Set aside specific time for writing. Developing a set schedule will go a long way towards helping you get your dissertation done. Set aside time each day for writing and do not use that time for anything else. This will get you in the habit of focusing and will also deal with motivation issues.\n\n\nBe sure to choose a time of day that is good for you. If you are too tired to write at night, write in the morning. If your brain takes half the day to boot up properly, write in the evening. When you write will entirely depend upon what is best for you.",
                "Pay attention to voice and tense. Be sure to use the correct voice and tense for papers in your discipline while working on your dissertation. It is incredibly difficult and time consuming to go back through your text and edit for tense and voice, so try to get it right the first time through. Ask your adviser what is the correct method and then make sure you pay attention to those details while writing. Also be sure not to switch voice in the text, unless there is a very good reason.",
                "Avoid certain types of language. Certain types of language do not serve you in high level academic work like this. Avoid these types of language from the start and you will save yourself some editing later on, since your adviser will undoubtedly tell you to change or remove it.\n\n\nColloquial language, slang, overly informal language and regionalized language are all extremely poor choices for inclusion in a dissertation. Do not include them under any circumstance.\nThe use of contractions are also frowned on in high level works. This tends to make language sound regionalized and informal, as discussed above. However, it also makes it very easy to slip in grammatical errors, so it is best to avoid them just in general.\nIndecisive or overly-open language is also very bad for a dissertation. You do not want to say that your thesis is “probably” right or that this evidence is “maybe” significant. Stand by your assertions, even if they may not be as solid as you’d like. You can always discuss problems with the theory later on.",
                "Cite, cite, cite. Seriously, not citing can get you accused of plagiarism. That’s a whole headache you want to avoid, so cite absolutely all of the information you present that is not yours. Citing will also serve to make your work seem more credible, since it proves that other scholars have come to similar conclusions.\n\n\nIf you want to emphasize that an idea is coming from you, rather than constantly stating that A said this or B said that, you can phrase your sentence like this, “String cheese is delicious and fun because it cheese and you can play with it. Further evidence of this can be seen in the research of Dr.’s A and B, in their earlier paper on the topic.” The idea is to present your view and evidence first and follow it with the research of others. This makes it seem like they support you, rather than you supporting them.\nParticularly bold claims or ideas which go against the common knowledge will especially need to be cited. These stand-out statements are usually the first for which others will look for evidence. Not citing will make you look incapable or incompetent.\nIf there is any doubt about whether you should cite something, just cite it. The answer is probably yes.",
                "Do a first read-through. Once you have completed your work, do a read-though. On this first read-through you will want to look for spelling and grammar mistakes. These will be distracting and stop the flow of thought as you read through to analyze the content, so deal with these and only these first so that you can focus on the content of the text later.\n\n\nMake a list of words you know you have a tendency to misspell or misuse. Most people have at least a few. When you are done writing, you can do a search through the document to find the incorrect versions and correct them.\nRemember that some words may technically be spelled correctly but be incorrect for the place in which you've used them. Their, there, and they’re are the most common examples. Even if you know the spelling and grammar rules, it’s easy to make mistakes like this, especially if you’re tired. Pay attention.",
                "Do a second read-through. Once you've completed your first read-through, do at least one more to check the content. Be sure that the transitions between paragraphs make sense, that your arguments are logical and easy to follow, that everything ties back to your thesis, that you don’t randomly start rambling, and other content considerations.",
                "Practice presentation. Around the time of completion is when you will want to begin practicing your presentation skills. A presentation before your committee is usually required, and audiences are often allowed. Most people do not have experience speaking in front of groups and it can be extremely nerve-racking, especially considering the context. Practicing how you will present your information, first in front of a mirror and then in front of friends and family, preferably well in advance of your presentation date."

        "How to Get Sober with a 12 Step Program": {
            "intro": "Alcohol, narcotics, and other addictions can be very tough to break. Such a monumental and brave task is often more easily handled when you have a clear path to follow and people to support you. Joining a twelve step program to get sober is a successful way of moving forward on your journey to recovery.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for a twelve step program. You can find lists of programs on the web, in doctors’ or public health offices, and even and in libraries. These resources will point you to lists of meetings in your area.[1]\n\nThere are also online meetings through many of these organizations’ websites.",
                "Attend a variety of meetings in different locations. Some meetings will meet your needs better than others and each group will have its own identity, cohesion, approach, and unique feeling reflecting the members participating.[2]",
                "Get a sponsor. A sponsor is someone who is also journeying through recovery and is a bit further along than you in this process. Your sponsor is also someone with whom you feel comfortable and can talk freely.[3]\n\nYou and your sponsor meet informally as equals and are there to help each other out and call each other in times of need.\nAlcoholics Anonymous, for one, suggests choosing someone of your gender identity and sexual orientation to decrease involvement in unrelated matters other than sobriety.",
                "Work the 12 steps with your sponsor. The steps are nearly the same in all programs and are a recipe for recovery. In addition to attending meetings, your sponsor may ask you to read program literature, pray, or meditate.[4]\n\nIt's okay to change sponsors if you need a different approach.\nIf you can’t reach your sponsor when you need help, call someone else from the program, attend a meeting, go to the nearest program office, or read some program literature until you get over your tough spot.",
                "Do the steps in order. Though they are just suggestions, you’re more likely to successfully recover if you follow through the whole program, in the purposeful order intended, and not skip any steps. Each step presents a challenge that pushes you to think and move forward.[5]\n\nAvoid “two-stepping,” or admitting you have a problem then jumping right to taking on membership responsibilities, such as becoming a sponsor to someone else. Take the time to truly journey through the steps at the pace you need before you can be a support to someone else.\nEmotional growth, maturity, personal awareness, and recovery take time.\nThe structure and function of the steps often gives meaning to a life that is struggling to find meaning.",
                "Identify with a \"home group.\" In a home group, you attend regularly enough to vote on issues that affect that group, feel especially comfortable enough to build and sustain friendships, and partake in group responsibilities, such as introducing new members or chairing a meeting.[6]\n\nHaving a home group increases your sense of belonging, often missing in the lives of people living with addictions, and allows you to have a secure and strong support system.\nHaving a home group does not mean that you cannot attend other meetings.",
                "Stick with the group. You may feel a number of reasons to leave or have doubts about the program’s effectiveness, but there are good reasons to keep going. Researchers have found that the longer you attend a group, the more likely you are to call on a sponsor when you need help and then you’re less likely to relapse.[7]\n\nThe longer you attend group and the more meetings you attend, the more likely you are to be abstinent.",
                "Don’t stress religion. Although there is talk of God in many twelve step programs, you do not have to be religious to recover. You and your sponsor can talk about ways to relate to the program that are non-religious. There are twelve step mantras rewritten for agnostics, Buddhists, humanists, Native American traditions, and many other belief systems.[8]\n\nMany of the basic principles are the same, dealing with perseverance, justice, power, and so on. The main goal for any twelve step program is recovery and self-awareness.",
                "Stay anonymous. Though you may want to develop a feeling of camaraderie, understanding, and fellowship, you don’t have to divulge too many personally identifying details. The success of the group often depends on being able to talk freely without worrying that people know who you are in your work or family life.[9]\n\nOnly give as many details in group as you feel comfortable giving.",
                "Keep realistic. Many of these programs are designed to work in concert with any other treatment you are currently undergoing with a professional in the relevant area. These are peer groups to support you, not cure your addiction.[10]\n\nMany of these programs can offer information but do not offer other services such as nursing care, legal advice, housing, or other social services.",
                "Attend no matter where you are. Even when you are travelling, there are 12 step meetings available around the world.[11]",
                "Know your fellow member types. While this may be the most ultimately diverse group you’ve ever attended and people have nothing in common but their addictions, there are certain personality types that tend to emerge. Some people get derailed in meetings by other members with ulterior motives and agendas so knowing what to watch out for will help you stay on track.[12]\n\nSometimes, romantic relationships happen quite innocently but there is also a term for someone who purposefully tries to date the ‘weaker’ new members – ‘the 13th stepper.’ This person takes advantage of members at their most vulnerable.\nInevitably, there will be tears. Don’t let yourself get too emotionally drained by the ‘crier’ in the group.\nThe old-timer is the ‘know-it-all’ in the group that has been in recovery for years. Some may find him intimidating but don’t be afraid to call on him for help. He’s seen it all and can likely be a very valuable support person.\nThe ‘dry drunk’ in AA is the one who cannot see how the program applies to him, still thinks of alcohol in a romanticized way, is over-confident in his abilities to stay sober, and tends to blame others for his problems.[13]",
                "Accept that you need help. This first step is admitting that your addiction has power over you and that you need assistance in breaking the cycle. This, some say, is the most important step.[14]\n\nPeople with addictions spend years believing that the substance they are addicted to is helping, not hindering them. That is why this first step is so important – it represents a monumental shift in thinking. This step is about being honest with yourself that you have a problem.\nStep 1 is humbling but also empowering, because now you have opened up to the possibility of healing.",
                "Have an open mind. Although many 12 step programs talk about believing in a higher power in order to help restore your sanity, what this step is really all about is having an open mind to all the possibilities now being presented to you as you explore your journey towards recovery.[15]\n\nIf it helps, think of the 12 step program itself as the “higher power.”\nThis step is about having hope that there is something out there to help guide you in recovering.",
                "Give yourself over to the journey of recovery and those helping you. This step traditionally talks about giving yourself over to God for help, but what can apply from this situation to all 12 step programs is having faith that others, such as your sponsor, can help you.[16]\n\nThis step is about relying on the goodness and experiences of others.",
                "Have courage. Step 4 is usually about putting yourself under a microscope, looking closely at the situations in which you find yourself drinking. You need to make a list of the situations that cause you to relapse or use alcohol.[17]\n\nThis step can be a really scary and intimate look at yourself, but can be very enlightening and empowering once you truly understand yourself.",
                "Ask for and accept help. Steps 5, 6, and 7 are generally about asking your friends, family, sponsors, and others for help, but you also have to be really open to accepting their help, even when that means you get tough love.[18]\n\nThese steps may involve sharing secrets you’ve not shared with someone else before, and you may feel ashamed of some of the things you’ve done, but this is a natural progression.\nAsk your friends to help you avoid places that trigger your addiction.\nBe open, honest, and willing to change.",
                "Make amends. Perhaps the second most difficult set of steps after accepting that you have a problem is accepting that you have wronged people with whom you now need to make amends. Steps 8, 9, and 10 are often about making lists of people you have hurt, intentionally or unintentionally, directly, or indirectly, and asking their forgiveness.[19]\n\nThese lists will likely be fluid documents, changing as new realizations come to you.\nFor example, if your alcoholism led you to drive drunk and you injured another driver, you need to acknowledge your wrongdoing and ask for that person's forgiveness.",
                "Carry on. Steps 11 and 12 are often about dedicating yourself to the healing journey, continuing down the healthy path you’re on, and sharing that knowledge and experience with others.[20]\n\nHere, you not only strive to increase your own potential, but often take on a service role of sponsoring or helping others to do the same.",
                "Take it slowly. Take it one second, one minute, one hour, and one day at a time. Easy does it. Addiction recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. Alcoholism is a chronic disorder with a danger of relapse.[21]\n\nIn case you feel the urge to buy something that feeds your drinking problem, put a \"no relapse\" reminder note in your wallet so you will see it whenever you dig in there to get money.",
                "Be confident. Remember that you are in control. The more confident you are in your ability to abstain and recover, the more likely you are to succeed.[22]\n\nUnderstanding your role in your own behavior can help you stop making excuses and increase your self-confidence. Internal locus of control is the extent to which you assume responsibility for your actions and believe you can control your life. Having an internal locus of control better focuses you for future success.[23]",
                "Don’t give up. If you are not immediately successful, keep trying. You can find a way to make this work for you. It can take a long time to successfully recover from alcohol abuse.[24]\n\nIt may encourage you to know that about a third of people who are treated for alcohol abuse problems show no further symptoms one year later.[25]\n\nTry visualization. A very successful technique in facing fears and overcoming challenges, visualization involves sitting quietly and focusing mentally on what you hope to achieve, watching the scene of you succeeding playing out in your mind.\nRecite positive affirmations to yourself. These little mantras, such as “I am taking back control of my life and my health” and “I will succeed in my effort to get sober,” help you focus on what is positive about what you’re doing and reaffirm that you’re making the right choice.[26]",
                "Get additional help. Alcohol abuse often occurs alongside another issue. You may have concurrent depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns requiring additional professional treatment such as counselling or psychotherapy.[27]\n\nThese additional resources will help you deal with the underlying psychological and emotional problems that may have lead to the very real physiological problem you now have. Treating the underlying issue will help prevent relapse.\nYou may require a period of inpatient treatment if your alcoholism or withdrawal is putting your immediate health and safety at risk. Twelve step programs are also available in residential treatment facility and hospital settings.\nStick to whatever medical routine your doctor orders. You may be put on Antabuse to making drinking alcohol seem repulsive to you, for example.\nSpiritual help often plays a role in recovery as many people find that getting in touch with their spiritual side strengthens their resolve.\nTeens with higher religious service attendance are more likely to abstain from substance abuse.[28]",
                "Examine your hobbies and social activities. You will likely find that many of your social activities and hobbies involve your addiction, such as drinking at a pool hall. You will need to find other social outings and places to go to that don’t involve your addiction in order to reduce temptation and the association between your addiction and having fun.[29]\n\nGo to different places that don’t serve alcohol, such as coffee shops, or invite your friends to play paintball instead of shooting pool at the pub.[30]\n\nAsk friends to help you by not drinking around you.\nGo to a park to socialize instead of a bar.\nSay \"No\" clearly and directly if someone offers you a drink. You can say, \"No, thank you\" or you can go into more detail, such as \"I'm not drinking because my doctor said to. I'd appreciate it if you could help me out by not asking me to have a drink.\"[31]",
                "Examine your friendships. You may need to distance yourself from friends and social activities that hinder your recovery.[32]\n\nAddiction is a very socially debilitating ailment. You will most likely find yourself feeling very uncomfortable in social situations during early sobriety. This is quite normal. An enormous part of the healing process is regaining the ability to create, maintain, and enhance healthy relationships\n\nThis may be daunting at first, but will become less so with each healthy relationship you form and foster.\nContinuing with healthy support networks is one of the key factors found in making your journey through the twelve step program a success.[33]\n\nTeens with strong social support networks are more likely to abstain from substance abuse.[34]",
                "Get your family into a support group. Support for family members is available through various programs such as Al-Anon and Alateen. Having your family members in a support group will help them to help you, by educating them on your illness and offering them ways of coping while you are in recovery.[35]\n\nIf you have a family member who abuses alcohol, get them into a support and treatment program as well to increase the chances of both of you recovering.",
                "Clean out your home. Reduce any temptation that lingers in the house or at work. Don't keep alcohol at home, even if you don't drink any more. Don't even keep cooking wine around. Remove barware, corkscrews, pub glasses -- anything that would remind you of drinking.[36]"

        "wikiHow to File a Case in Small Claims Court": {
            "intro": "In small claims courts, individuals can file lawsuits quickly and inexpensively. You can file suits against individuals, corporations, partnerships and other entities. Each state sets the maximum amount that you can sue for in these courts. The dollar amounts range from $2,500 to $25,000.[1] Rules for filing a case in small claims court vary between states and even counties. Before filing your case, be sure to check with your county clerk or an attorney to find out the rules in your state.",
            "steps": [
                "Review the facts of your case to be certain you have grounds for a lawsuit. The first step in the small claims process is to evaluate your potential case. The question to ask here is whether someone owes you money and is refusing to pay.\n\n\nGenerally, you can bring civil cases for disputes that don’t involve a large amount of money.\nIf you do end up suing someone, you become the plaintiff and the person you are suing is the defendant.\nMany types of cases can be heard in small claims court. For example, the return of security deposit or a payment dispute over broken or damaged property. Other cases involve breach of a written or verbal contract. In your case, figure out how much money you are owed and by whom. Also consider why they owe you that money.[2]\n\nIn some counties, small claims courts review evictions and other landlord-tenant matters.[3] If you're dealing with such issues, you'll have to find out what the laws in your area are if you are trying to evict a tenant.",
                "Consider consulting a lawyer. Depending on the complexity of your case, you may want to consider contacting an attorney.\n\n\nIn some states, you can't have a lawyer in small claims court. You may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to small claims court, though.\nIf you need more guidance, you may contact a lawyer through your state bar association.[4] State and county bar associations often offer free referral services to qualified local attorneys, and may also offer free consultations with attorneys that specialize in the legal issues relevant to your case.",
                "Mail a letter via certified mail demanding payment. A “demand letter” is a formal letter demanding monetary payment or some other action from another party. Send a demand letter to the person who owes you money. This will cost a little more, but will create a legal record of the fact that your letter was delivered.\n\n\nA demand letter should explain what payment or action you are seeking. It should make it clear why you are seeking the payment or particular action. It should also specify a time limit for payment or performing the particular action.[5]\n\nAlthough not required, a demand letter is an attempt to settle that matter without taking formal legal action. In some cases, just the threat of a lawsuit can cause the person you are considering suing to pay you.[6]\n\nBecause of the financial and emotional costs of filing a lawsuit, try to use small claims court as a last resort, not as your first option.",
                "Consider mediation. Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). ADR is a tool you can consider to get the money the other party owes you without a lawsuit. You can suggest to the other party that a third party mediate your conflict. You can do so in the demand letter or at any point during the process:[7]\n\nMediation is a process of negotiation where all sides state their case to an impartial third party. This mediator then issues a judgment about who owes what to whom.[8]\n\nIn some states, courts offer mediation as a free or low-cost service. Mediation is also quicker than bringing a suit in court.\nParties often share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator, which will vary based on the mediator and complexity of the case. This person will assist them in working out a mutually agreeable outcome. The process includes an evaluation by a neutral third-party, negotiation, and mediation.[9]\n\nADR is often less adversarial, more efficient and less expensive than formal legal processes. [10]",
                "Consider arbitration. Arbitration is another form of ADR. Arbitration allows parties to litigate the dispute without going to court.[11]\n\nArbitration may be binding or non-binding. If the parties agree to binding arbitration, they waive their right to a trial. In doing so, they agree to accept the arbitrator’s decision as final. Non-binding arbitration means the parties may request a trial if they do not accept the arbitrator’s decision.[12]\n\nYour local county court may have more information about both mediation and arbitration.",
                "Familiarize yourself with your state’s laws governing small claims cases. If you decide to take your claim to court, you should spend some time studying several important topics.\n\n\nLearn how much money you can ask for in small claims court. State law determines the amount. The rule of thumb is that you should be asking for less than $10,000 in small claims court.\nSome states, such as Alabama, offer you a maximum of $3,000 in small claims. Other states, such as Tennessee, offer up to $25,000.[13]\n\nIf you believe you are owed more than your state’s laws permit, you can't file your case in small claims court. In that case, you have two options. You could lower the amount of money you're asking for to have your case fit into small claims guidelines. Or you could pursue the case in a higher court. Pursuing the case in a higher court requires legal advice. It will also result in more fees and could take up to several years for a hearing.",
                "Determine the right venue for the suit. Figuring out where to file the claim can be tricky. For assistance, visit the local superior court in the county where you live. Or you can use the Internet to find out which court handles small claims in your county. The place where you’ll file suit will most likely depend on the following:[14]\n\nWhere the defendant lives.\nWhere the contract was signed or carried out.\nWhere the business involved is located.\nWhere the damage happened.\nWhere the goods involved are permanently kept.",
                "Gather information about how to file suit. After locating the appropriate court, call or visit the court website to find out if it operates a self-help center. If the court offers this service, ask the self-help center staff for more guidance on how to file a case in small claims court.\n\n\nSome counties, such as the County of San Diego, provide detailed guidebooks on how to file a small claims court case.[15]\n\nCertain professional organizations, such as the Texas Young Lawyers Association, also provide guidebooks.[16]",
                "Determine the exact name(s) of the person(s) you want to sue. It's important that you use the exact legal name of the person you want to bring to small claims court.[17] Use the country clerk's computers to track down the legal name(s) of anyone you wish to name in your suit.\n\n\nIf you are suing a business, corporation or partnership, you can identify the legal name of the business entity by visiting your Secretary of State’s website. For example, the California Secretary of State’s website allows Internet users to search for the legal name of a particular business entity. This will allow you to locate the identity of the business owner.\nYour local County Clerk/Assessor or Recorder may be able to help. Some offer an online option that allows you to access the Fictitious Business Name Index from your own computer. This allows you to track down the identity of a business owner. Ask the county clerk for permission to access the Fictitious Business Name Index if you can't search for it online.",
                "Determine how you can pay court costs. Before heading to the courthouse to file your small claims complaint, contact the clerk of courts office. The clerk will tell you how you can pay your court costs.\n\n\nThe cost of filing a claim in small claims court ranges from around $15 to $200, depending on the state you live in.[18]\n\nSome courts will only accept cash or credit cards. Others will also accept personal checks.\nIf you are worried about the cost, note that some states have waivers available for people with lower incomes. Ask if you are eligible.",
                "File the claim. Visit your county courthouse to fill out the necessary paperwork.[19] In some counties, you can find the required paperwork online.\n\n\nDepending on your state, the online forms may include a “Plaintiff’s Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court” form as well as a “Proof of Service (Small Claims)” form.[20]\n\nWhen you file your claim, you must provide a succinct and informative explanation of why you believe you're owed money.\nIf you have any evidence to support your claim for money owed, such as a signed contract, be certain to attach it to your complaint.\nThe county clerk should be able to give you a court date right away. You'll need this date when you're serving the papers.\nIf you don’t understand something, be sure to ask one of the clerks. They are knowledgeable and usually helpful.\nIf you must file in person, bring your ID. Some states require you to show it.",
                "Serve the defendant. The process of notifying the other party of the lawsuit is called \"serving\" the defendant.[21] You can use several different ways to serve the defendant the papers.\n\n\nOne way is to enlist someone who's not in any way a party to the lawsuit and who is over 18 years old to serve the papers.[22]\n\nAnother way is to hire a professional process server (also called \"due process server\") to serve the papers. This is a good idea if you think the defendant might try to avoid the service.[23]\n\nA third way is to let the county sheriff, marshal or constable serve the papers. This is another good choice for defendants that might try to avoid service. This option is not available everywhere, and does typically require a fee.[24]\n\nA final option is to have the county clerk serve the papers via certified mail.[25]\n\nYou must have the papers served on the defendant a certain number of days before your court date. For example, in California, you must serve the court papers at least 15 days in advance of the court date. If the defendant is a person, business, or public entity outside of the county, you have 20 days.[26]\n\nThe service rules will vary depending on your state and can be confusing. Be sure to clarify the rules with the county clerk or an attorney.\nAll defendants in the lawsuit must be served; it's not enough to serve just one of the defendants if there is more than one.[27]\n\nCorporations and limited liability companies (LLC’s) have specific assigned agents for service. You can locate a corporation's or LLC’s registered agent by visiting your Secretary of State’s website. You may also check the company’s website or call the company and ask who can accept service on behalf of the company.",
                "Sit in on a small claims court hearing. Before your hearing, go sit in the audience of a small claims hearing. It can be helpful to know what to expect when the judge calls your name and asks you to present your case.[28]\n\nBeing prepared is an easy way to increase your chances of winning. Don't underestimate the value of preparedness.",
                "Enlist witnesses and evidence. You don't want to show up to court with an entourage of friends and followers. But having a few witnesses who can convince the judge of your reliability can be helpful. Whenever possible, use direct or circumstantial evidence. Either is better than making unsubstantiated claims.\n\n\nDirect evidence is evidence that proves a fact without any guesswork. You might be able to provide many types of direct evidence. One example might be the damaged or broken piece of property you are seeking payment for; testimony from someone who saw the defendant damage the property would also be direct evidence; and a third example might be a receipt displaying the total value of the damaged property.[29]\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests something occurred, but you can't prove it directly. For example, you might have a witness who says she saw the defendant take the piece of property and enter a building. She might go on to say that she saw the defendant leave the building with the damaged or broken property. This doesn't prove the defendant damaged the property. It would, however, suggest that this is a likely possibility.[30]\n\nWhenever possible, avoid relying on hearsay. Hearsay is testimony or documents which quote a person who is not in court.[31]",
                "Get your point across effectively. Your judge will likely be hearing many cases and will appreciate a clear, efficient explanation of your case. When preparing for your hearing, be sure to consider the following:\n\n\nWhat happened?\nHow has it affected you?\nHow much does the other party owe you?\nWhy is the defendant at fault?\nPrepare concise answers to all these questions.",
                "Understand the law. Hopefully, you'll win your case. But just because you win a decision in small claims court doesn't mean you'll get the money owed to you. The defendant, also known as the “judgment debtor,” has 30 days to either pay you or ask for a new trial by appeal.[32]\n\nIf the debtor does not pay within 30 days, consider the steps below. Note that some of these options may not be available in your state. Check with the county clerk or an attorney to determine which options are available to you.",
                "Levy the debtor’s wages. In some states, such as California, you can garnish the defendant’s wages until the debt is paid. This means a portion of any pay checks the debtor earns will go directly to you.\n\n\nTo garnish wages you’ll need to complete a “Writ of Execution” form. It must be approved by the court and served to the defendant.[33]",
                "Levy the debtor’s bank account. In some states, you can request a bank levy. This means that the money will be taken out of the defendant’s bank account to satisfy the judgment.\n\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to know the name and branch address of the bank or other financial institution used by the defendant.\nTo perform a bank levy, you’ll also need to complete a “Writ of Execution” form.[34]",
                "Record an Abstract of Judgment. Another option that may be available in your state is to record an \"Abstract of Judgment for Civil and Small Claims.\" This puts a lien on any land, house or other building the debtor owns.[35]\n\nTo record an Abstract of Judgment for Civil and Small Claims, you’ll need to complete another court form.[36]",
                "Ask the police to do a “till tap” or place a “keeper” in the debtor’s business. If the debtor is a business with a cash register, a law enforcement official can go to the business and take enough money to satisfy your judgment and associated fees.[37]\n\nAnother option is for law enforcement to remain in the defendant’s business establishment. The officer who does this is called a \"keeper.\" The keeper will take all funds that come in until the judgment is satisfied.\nTo request a “till tap” or a “keeper,” you must complete another court form. In some states, such as California, you must complete a “Writ of Execution” form.[38] In some states, you must pay significant fees in advance. A till tap, for example, typically costs $60 to $100. The cost of a keeper will vary depending on how long you want them to remain at the business.",
                "Conduct a judgment debtor’s examination. A judgement debtor’s examination is a procedure in which the judgment debtor must go back to court. In court, the debtor must answer questions about his/her finances.[39]\n\nThe judgment debtor will be asked about the existence, location and amount of income he/she earns. As part of the examination, you can subpoena bank books and other similar financial documents. You can also request the judge to order the defendant to turn over any assets in his/her possession.\nTo request a judgment debtor’s examination you must complete another court form. In some states, such as California, you must complete a “Judgment Debtor’s Examination” form.[40]",
                "Suspend the judgment debtor’s driver’s license. In some states, if you win a small claims case over an auto accident and the defendant doesn't pay, you can have the defendant's license suspended.[41]\n\nIn California, you can request a 90-day suspension if the judgement is under $750. To use this option, you must complete DMV Form DL17.[42]\n\nIf the judgment is over $750, you can request suspension until the defendant satisfies the judgment. To use this option, you must complete DMV Form DL30.[43]"
