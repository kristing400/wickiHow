            "intro": "The \"department store method\" is the industry standard for folding shirts neatly. Perhaps you want to reorganize your dresser. Maybe you want to refold the shirts that you try on at the department store. The process is easy if you know the steps![1]",
            "steps": [
                "Lay out the shirt. Spread the shirt face-down on a flat, clean surface. Smooth out any wrinkles. Let the arms of the shirt lay naturally extended. If the shirt features buttons or a zipper: button all buttons, and zip the zipper shut completely before you begin folding. [2]\n\nIf the shirt has a hood: fold this bit down first. Lay the hood down flat against the back of the shirt before folding the sleeves inward.\nTry placing a clean, crisp magazine on the back of the shirt as a guide for a neater fold. Squarely center the magazine right below the collar. Then, make your folds in line with the edges of the magazine.[3]",
                "Fold one sleeve of the shirt. First, pinch the top of the shirt on either side of the collar. Hold the fabric tight so that you don't create any unwanted creases. Then, take the sleeve on the same side that you're holding the collar. Fold the sleeve and any extra fabric across the center crease of the shirt. Make a straight line from top to bottom on the folded side.",
                "Fold the other sleeve. Repeat the fold for the sleeve that you haven't creased yet. For the sake of presentation, try to make the second fold symmetrical with the first. Don't be afraid to adjust the sleeves a bit so that they match one another.[4]",
                "Fold one side of the shirt to the center. The edge of the shirt should extend almost exactly halfway across the back of the shirt. Firmly crease the edge so that it forms a perfect vertical line down the back of the garment.\n\nIf the shirt has long sleeves: fold them back in on themselves so that they run lengthwise down the back of the shirt.\nIf the shirt has short sleeves: fold them so that they fit neatly and symmetrically into the back of the shirt.",
                "Bring the other side to the center. Fold the other edge of the shirt over to meet the first edge in the middle of the back. Make sure that the two edges run parallel, and that they do not overlap.\n\nIf you are using a magazine to make the fold more precise: fold each side of the shirt until it hits the magazine. Simply fold the shirt to the width of a magazine.",
                "Crease the shirt in half. Fold up the bottom edge of the shirt so that it meets the top of the shoulders. Let the edge rest just below the collar. Smooth out any creases, and make sure that the fold is symmetrically all the way across the width of the shirt.",
                "Flip the shirt over to finish. Make sure that all the edges are straight and crisp. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles in the fabric, and check that the shirt is ready for sale. In department stores, the shirt is always displayed with the front facing up. [5]\n\nIf you are folding your shirt for convenient home storage, then it is doesn't matter so much which way you display the garment. It may still be convenient to keep your shirts front-side up so that you can easily tell which is which."

        "wikiHow to Have a Relaxing Day": {
            "intro": "Stress is an unavoidable part of life brought on by both good and bad events. Although stress can't be avoided you can manage your response to it. By taking a day to yourself and making it as relaxing as you can the harmful effects of stress can be reduced, improving your health and sense of well being.",
            "steps": [
                "Take your time. You may have a rough idea of what you want to do with your relaxing day. Since it is your day to relax you will want to plan things according to your own schedule without worrying about the usual pressure to get things done. Unwind and do things at your own pace during your relaxing day.[1]\n\nYou may find not having anything planned at all is the most relaxing way to spend your day.\nConsider sleeping in, waking up whenever you feel like it.\nRelax and enjoy whatever activities you end up doing, taking your time and fully enjoying it.",
                "Do what you want. It's your relaxing day. Plan on doing whatever you find most enjoyable and restful. Everyone will have different ideas on what might be relaxing so take a moment to plan a few things that you know you would find calming.[2]\n\nYou might want to lay on the couch and watch some of your favorite movies or shows.\nListening to your favorite music while you cook a delicious meal might be relaxing.\nSpending the day reading a new and exciting book can be a great way to relax and enjoy your day.",
                "Catch up on lost sleep. Sleep is an extremely important aspect of maintaining health and often times it is neglected. Busy schedules and feelings of stress can cause you to lose sleep, resulting in feeling tired during the day. Consider going to bed early on your relaxing day and getting a good night's rest, recovering lost hours of sleep and waking up feeling invigorated.[3][4]\n\nThe amount of sleep required will change over a person's life, largely based on how old they are.\nMost adults need around seven to eight hours of sleep per night to feel rested.\nLack of sleep can affect health negatively, causing you to feel tired more often and even lowering your immune system's response.",
                "Focus on what you are grateful for. It can be easy to focus on things that aren't going our way. This will cause feelings of stress and worry to increase. Instead, use your relaxing day to focus on positive aspects or accomplishments in your life. Take some time to make a list of the things you are most grateful for in your life to diminish the stress of negative thinking.[5]\n\nConsider taking up a journal. Everyday you can write about the things that went well or that you are happy for.\nThink about your friends and family, writing down your favorite moments you've shared with them.\nTry to write at least three things that made your happy during your day.",
                "Go for a walk. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress and have a positive effect on the mood. Getting in some light exercise by going for a walk can be a good way to get rid of stress in your body and make your day a relaxing one.\n\n\nTry walking to somewhere new to you, exploring and enjoying your neighborhood.\nWalk around your favorite local park.\nTake your time and enjoy the sights and sounds as you go for your stroll.",
                "Do some stretching. Stress can build up tension and tightness in the body. You can use your relaxing day to get in some stretching practice. Stretching the body, joints, and muscles can restore mobility and reduce built up tension in the body, bringing about a sense of relaxation.\n\n\nA simple stretch is a toe touch. Stand up straight and then bend down, trying to bring your hands to your feet. You should feel this stretch most strongly in your hamstrings.\nYou can stretch the front of your legs by standing up straight, grabbing your ankle and pulling it up towards your back.\nNever bounce the body part you are stretching as this could cause injury. Gently stretch and hold the stretch for a few seconds instead of any jerky or bouncy motions.\nWhen you stretch an area imagine the tension leaving it and that it is becoming more and more relaxed.\nInhale slowly and deeply as you stretch. Exhale fully and gently as you relax the stretch.\nClosing your eyes can help you focus on the stretch.",
                "Use the progressive muscle relaxation method. Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple and easy method to reduce tension in the body. It allows you to fully feel all areas of the body by deliberately increasing tension and then fully relaxing them. Using this method will allow you to loosen up your muscles on your relaxing day.[6]\n\nStart by focusing on your feet. Tense your feet as much as you can for about five seconds and then relax them for thirty.\nDo the same technique on each body part as you work your way up to your head and neck.\nIf any area still feels tight you can repeat the technique to relax it further.",
                "Take a hot bath. Taking a hot bath is a great way to relax the body, relieving tension and soreness in your muscles. Think about adding some of your favorite scents, bath salts or decorating the room with candles or other relaxing items. Once you've prepared your bath all that's left to do is soak and enjoy.",
                "Give yourself a massage. You can go out to a spa and get a massage which can be an excellent way to relax. However, if you want to stay home and enjoy a day to yourself you can give yourself a massage, working out tension in your muscles and bringing about a sense of relaxation.[7]\n\nMassage your scalp by gently rubbing the sides of your head near the temples.\nMassage your face by using your fingertips, rubbing your jawline, hairline, cheekbones, and earlobes.\nMassage your arm by laying it flat on your leg and using your opposite palm to rub down your forearm towards your wrist.\nMassage your thighs using your palm or elbows, applying gentle pressure as you move down towards your knee.",
                "Pick a type of meditation that appeals to you. The term meditation describes the general practice of working with your mental life to reduce stress there. Although the term itself is general there are specific forms of meditation that you can engage in. Examine the following overview to get you started in finding a form of meditation that feels right for you:[8]\n\nYou can create a safe and wonderful space in your mind and explore it, imagining it with all your senses.\nRepeating a phrase or word can help keep your focus on the phrase instead of bothersome or distracting thoughts.\nTry simply watching your thoughts and feelings, allowing them to pass by without judgment or attachment.",
                "Get comfortable. The first step in meditating will be to manage your environment, making it calm and distraction free. The focus during meditation will be on your inner mental life and outside distractions can cause you to lose that focus. Make your space stress free and get your body relaxed and comfortable before you start to meditate.[9]\n\nYou might find that laying down or comfortably sitting are good postures for meditation.\nMake sure your clothes are lose fitting and comfortable.\nTurn your phone off before getting started.",
                "Try mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation allows the stream of noise that your mind produces to pass by you, allowing you to relax and simply observe. You will need to quiet your mind and focus, relaxing into the meditation and allowing any distracting thoughts or stress to pass you by without attachment to them.[10][11]\n\nSit down and close your eyes.\nTake note of your mental activity. Chances are you will be talking or thinking to yourself.\nCalmly watch your inner thoughts, images, or feelings that your mind produces.\nYour goal is to simply observe these thoughts without attaching or engaging with them.\nIf you find yourself engaging with your thoughts, gently return your focus and resume passively watching them.\nYou will find that over time you mental chatter will fade and grow quiet, affording you a calm and relaxed mind.",
                "Consider visualization techniques. Your imagination has a great amount of power over how you feel mentally. The human mind doesn't make distinctions between your imagined experiences and reality. Take advantage of this fact and create a wonderful and relaxing experience using your imagination.[12]\n\nGet comfortable and close your eyes.\nThink of a place that you find calming and safe, somewhere that you love being.\nTry to see this space in great detail. Think of what the colors look like here or what items or people appear as. Try to see this calming space as clearly as you can.\nImagine the sounds of this space. What noises can you hear? Take your time and really imagine that you can hear the sounds of your visualized space.\nAsk yourself what smells are in your calm and relaxing space. Inhale and imagine the scents as your breathe them in.\nPay attention to how your space feels. Ask yourself what the temperature is, what some items feel like to touch, or what a breeze might feel like.\nTake your time and enjoy the space you have created, exploring and relaxing there for as long as you like.",
                "Slowly return to normal activity. After you have finished meditating you will want to slowly refocus your attention on the “outside” world again. Notice any feelings of inner calm or peace as you engage once again with the world, knowing that you can find these relaxed feelings again when you start to feel stress in the future."

        "How to Make Quick and Tasty Moonshine Whiskey": {
            "intro": "Whiskey has been warming the hearts of cowboys, billionaires, and everyone in between for hundreds of years. From the stuff of moonshine legends to the finest of scotches, whiskey is a definite crowd pleaser. However, before you embark on your whiskey-making journey, you should be aware that making whiskey at home is regarded as illegal by federal law.",
            "steps": [
                "Place 10 pounds of whole kernel corn into a burlap sack. This may sound like an odd thing to do, but your corn needs to sprout and putting it in a burlap sack will help the sprouting process along. Once all of your corn is contained in the burlap sack, cover the sack with warm water. You can do this by placing the bag in a tub or large (super large) bucket.[1]",
                "Put the burlap sack somewhere dark and warm. You will need to keep the corn moist for roughly 10 days. Check your corn for sprouts. When the sprouts have grown so that they are ¼ of an inch long, your corn is ready for the next step in the recipe.[2]",
                "Remove your corn from the burlap sack. Wash your corn in a tub, making sure to scrub away any dirt along with the corn sprouts. If your corn has roots, scrub these away too. Move the washed corn to your primary fermenter.",
                "Use a pole or other similar object to crush all of the corn. This is called making the mash. Make sure that each kernel gets thoroughly cracked. When you are sure all of the kernels are cracked, add five gallons of boiling water to your mash.",
                "Stir the boiling water and the mashed corn together. When the water has cooled down to 86º F (30º C) add one cup of champagne yeast starter. Mix the ingredients together.[3]",
                "Heat six gallons of water to 70ºF (21.1ºC). When the water has reached the desired temperature, add seven pounds of rye grain, two pounds of barley, and one pound of malt. Stir all of the ingredients together.[4]",
                "Raise the temperature while you stir. You will have to constantly stir the mixture. While stirring, increase the temperature of the mash by five degrees every two minutes. When the temperature reaches 160 ºF (71.1ºC), do not raise the temperature anymore.[5]",
                "Stir the mixture for two to three hours. You will need to keep the temperature at 160ºF (71.1ºC) so that the starch turns into fermentable sugar and dextrin. This can only be achieved by continuing to stir for two to three hours.",
                "Filter off the water and then place your mash into your fermenter. Let your mash cool down to 70ºF (21.1ºC). Add three grams of yeast and stir the mixture well.",
                "Transfer your mash to a fermenter. You can use a funnel to pour your mash into the fermenter of your choice. Many home brewers use glass carboys, which are essentially large glass bottles. You can often buy them with an air lock (which you will definitely need).[6]\n\nYou can also make your own air lock. To do this, drill a hole in your carboy cork or lid that exactly the size of surgical tubing (which you will also need for this method to work). Once you have drilled the hole, run the surgical tubing into the hole, letting the other end of the tubing hang down into a glass or jar of water.",
                "Seal your fermenter. Once you have added all of the mash and yeast, you will need to seal your fermenter with an airlock so that absolutely no air can get in or out of your fermentation device. The process of fermentation involves the sugars in your mash, like glucose or fructose, getting converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide.[7]",
                "Let your mash ferment. The length of time you should let your mash ferment will depend on the recipe you used. It could anywhere from a couple of days to longer than a week. For the corn whiskey recipe listed above, let your mash ferment for seven to ten days. For the rye whiskey recipe, let the mash ferment for five to seven days.[8]",
                "Know how to tell when your mash is done fermenting. There are several ways to tell you can safely take your whiskey out of your fermenter. The best and most accurate way to tell if the fermentation process has ended is by using a hydrometer, though you can also do a visual inspection.[9]\n\n\nUsing a Hydrometer: Hydrometers measure the density of a liquid compared to the density of water. When the mash is done fermenting, the number reading on the hydrometer should stay the same. You should take a reading one time each day, for three days around the time when your recipe says your mash should be done fermenting. A good way to use the hydrometer is to take a sample of your mash by using a wine thief or turkey baster. Put this small sample into a graduated cylinder. Lower the hydrometer into the cylinder and gently swirl it around to release any bubbles. Take a reading right at the level of the liquid. This reading should be the same for three days in a row.",
                "Try a visual inspection. It is recommended that you use a hydrometer to determine whether or not your mash is done fermenting, however if you really don’t want to buy one, you can try to do a visual inspection of your fermenter. Inspect the top outer edge of the fermenter. Are there any bubbles being formed? The day that you notice there are no bubbles forming, give your mash one more day to ferment and then move on to the distillation process.",
                "Know what it means to distill your whiskey. The process of distillation focuses on separating the ethanol (alcohol) created in the fermentation process from the wort (or used mash). The goal is to get 80% ethanol and 20% flavors and water from the mash.[10]",
                "Buy or build your still. For safety reasons, it is generally in your best interest to buy a copper or stainless steel still from a still making company. There are plenty of websites that have quality stills for purchase. If, however, you would prefer to take on the project of building your own still, you can learn how to do so here.",
                "Transfer your fermented wort to your still. Fermented wort is referred to as ‘wash’. To transfer your wash, you will need to strain or siphon your wash through a cheesecloth and then into your still. The cheesecloth is necessary because you want to allow as few of the larger chunks of mash into the still as possible. If you choose to siphon your wash rather than strain in, try to leave as much of the solid chunks in the bottom of the fermenter.[11]\n\nIf you do end up with some of the larger chunks in your still, its not the end of the world. You can leave them in there.",
                "Assemble the rest of your still and heat your wash. You will have to assemble the rest of the still according the instructions that came with it. Again, if you have made your own still and want to refer back to the wikiHow instructions, click here. Once the rest of the still is assembled, slowly heat your wash. If you heat your wash too quickly, you may burn it. Over the course of 30 to 60 minutes, bring your wash to a boil.",
                "Read the thermometer near the cooling condenser. On your still, there should be a thermometer placed right before the cooling condenser. As the wash boils, keep on an eye on this thermometer. When it reads 120º F- 140º F (50º C-60º C), start the cooling water for the condenser tube. Doing this will begin your distillation process.[12]",
                "Throw the ‘head’ out. Once you have added the cooling water, the condenser will begin to drip. For a wash that is five gallons in size, you will want to throw out the first 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) (¼ cup) that comes out of the condenser. This first bit is called the ‘head’ and is the methanol boiling out of the wash. The head has a nasty flavor that you will not want mixing with the rest of your whiskey.",
                "Move on to the ‘body’. Once you have thrown out the head, read the thermometer again. It should read 175º F-185º F (80º C-85º C). At this time, the distillate coming out of the distiller is the ethanol boiling off, or the “body”. This is the liquid gold you’ve been waiting for. You will want to collect the body in 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) containers so that you can keep track of your product.[13]",
                "Throw out the ‘tails’. When the temperature has reached roughly 205º F (96º C), you will want to stop collecting the distillate. The liquid now coming out of the distiller is call the ‘tails’. This will also give your whiskey a bad flavor, so keep it separate from the body.",
                "Let your still cool and then clean it thoroughly. After you have collected all of your distillate, you will need to let each part of the still cool (be careful--it is very hot). Once it has cooled, clean it well.",
                "Select your aging process. Most whiskeys are aged in oak barrels. However, if you don’t have any oak barrels on hand, you can also add oak chips to your whiskey while it ages in another jar or container. Allowing the whiskey to age will give it that beautiful whiskey flavor that we all love. You can buy both charred oak barrels and oak chips online.[14]\n\nIf you choose to age your whiskey in a jar or other closed container, you will need to regularly open the jar to let the alcohol vapors escape as they would do if being aged in a wooden barrel (this escaped vapor is called the “angels share”). Let your jars breath once a week at a minimum.\nIf you choose to use a barrel, fill your barrel with warm water first. Doing this will cause the wood to swell, effectively sealing off any cracks the wood might have. This is important to do or else your whiskey might leak out of your barrel.",
                "Let your whiskey age. When making whiskey at home, the aging process takes a lot less time than commercial distillers take, as you are no doubt making a much smaller batch of whiskey. Because of this, your whiskey is more exposed to the wood of the barrel or chips, because there is less liquid vying for a spot up against the wood. Your whiskey will be aged in a matter of months.",
                "Sample your whiskey every few weeks. When aging whiskey at home, there is a chance that you might ‘over oak’ your liquor. To avoid this, sample your whiskey once every three or so weeks.[15]",
                "Determine your whiskey’s alcohol content and dilute as necessary. To determine your whiskey’s alcohol content (ABV) you can use your distiller’s hydrometer. Keep in mind that a whiskey with 75 to 80% alcohol is going to be a relatively unpleasant thing to drink. In general, whiskey gets diluted to 80 proof, or 40% alcohol. To dilute, add water.",
                "Bottle your whiskey immediately after you dilute it. Once your whiskey has reached the taste and color you prefer, its time to bottle it. Store your bottled whiskey or enjoy it immediately, the choice is yours. Enjoy!"

        "How to Do an Underhand Serve": {
            "intro": "In the sport of volleyball, performing an underhand serve is one of the most basic skills you will need. Serving is the only time in a volleyball match when you have the opportunity to be in control of a stationary ball, and you can also score a lot of points this way, so it’s important to develop good technique. An underhand serve doesn't take as much strength as an overhand serve or as much practice as a jump serve, so it's great for beginners.",
            "steps": [
                "Get your feet into position. Stand with your non-dominant foot in front with your toes facing forward. Your dominant foot should be in the back with toes pointed slightly out.\n\n\nShift your weight to your dominant foot.\nMake sure your hips are facing straight forward, not angled to the side.[1]",
                "Ready the ball. Cup your non-dominant hand slightly and place the ball in it. Make sure the ball securely balanced so it won't wobble or fall out of your hand. [2]\n\nKeep your fingers slightly loose to distribute the weight of the ball. This will help it stay balanced.\nDon’t grip the ball with your fingers. You want it to be stable, but it still has to be able to fly out of your hand when you hit it.",
                "Lower the ball. Bring the arm holding the ball across to the side of your body in front of your hitting arm. The ball should be at the height of your mid-thigh. [3]\n\nStraighten the arm with the ball in it, and move it to the side by shifting your arm at the shoulder, not the elbow.\nYou want the ball to be low so that you can put more power into it as you move your whole body forward and up.",
                "Lean your shoulders forward. Move your hips back and keep your upper back straight as you bring your shoulders towards the ball. This brings your a little closer to the ball so that you have more control.\n\n\nDon’t hunch over but make sure you aren’t standing up straight.\nAs your hips move back, you can raise the toes on your front foot so your heel is touching the ground and your toes are pointing up.",
                "Choose a strategic place for the ball to land. You want to confuse the opposition as much as possible. If you are practicing on your own it might not seem as important, but when you’re playing on a team you will want the ball to go where you aim it-- so practice aiming!\n\n\nFirst, practice aiming for the deep right or deep left of the court. This will force passers to move out of formation.\nAfter you practice that, begin aiming for places between players. This will cause players to be confused about who should get the ball, which will improve your strategic advantage. [4]",
                "Adjust your angle to the net. If you are aiming for the deep left, your shoulders will point left and your back foot will move slightly right, and vice versa. [5]\n\nTrace a straight line with your eyes across the court. Bring your eyes from your chosen landing spot to the point on the bottom of the ball where you will hit it.\nIf you have to move your head to the side to trace a line from your landing point to your contact point, you should adjust your feet and shoulders so that you are facing your chosen landing point.",
                "Squeeze your hitting hand into a fist. Then, rotate your arm so that your closed fingers and the inside of your wrist are facing up.\n\n\nPicture your fist hitting the contact point on the ball, and following a line to the point where you want it to land.\nIt is also possible to have your fist facing the side, with your wrist turned inside and your thumb facing up.",
                "Determine the arc of the ball. The desired arc of the ball depends on whether you want the ball to land in deep on the opposing side, or closer to you. Hitting the ball with more force forward will mean that the ball will fly lower and faster to the back of the court, while hitting the ball upward will mean that the ball will fly higher and land closer to you.\n\n\nUsually, low arcs that end deep are desirable in volleyball. They are hard to pass and control, and so it is more likely that you can score points on them.\nIf you know that two people closer to the front will be confused by a serve landing between them, you can aim for a higher arc that ends there.\nIf you are looking for more speed and control, you may want to try an overhand serve.",
                "Draw your hitting arm straight back. It should move quickly, like a pendulum. Then swing it forward firmly, hitting the bottom of the ball with your closed fist.\n\n\nYou should hit the ball just below the center so it will follow an upward trajectory over the net.[6]\n\nSpeed up your swing just before you make contact with the bottom of the ball.",
                "As you swing your arm, step forward. You should shift your weight onto your non-dominant foot, which should be in front. Move your whole body forward and up, propelling the ball over the net.",
                "Follow through with your arm. Your arm should continue in an upward arc after you hit the ball. Bringing your arm all the way up will better guarantee a straight and true flight path over the net. [7]\n\nKeep your arm straight. It should swing straight up like a pendulum, to a height equal to or just above your head.\nRecall the imaginary line you traced from your landing point to your contact point. Your fist should trace over that line as it follows through.",
                "Get into a ready position. After you serve the ball, get ready immediately. Stand facing forward with your feet shoulder width apart, legs bent, and arms straight down in front of you with hands clasped together.\n\n\nAllow your arms to linger on the follow-through before clasping them together to get ready.\nYou can briefly check to see how your ball lands, but don’t get too distracted to do your part when the ball comes back over the net."

        "wikiHow to Smoke Ribs": {
            "intro": "Ribs. Just like baseball and the 4th of July, smoked ribs are an American institution. Nothing beats a backyard barbecuing session with smoked ribs amongst friends and family. Thankfully, smoking ribs is an easy task, even if you don't have an expensive smoker. With a beautifully-smoked rack of ribs, you'll have your guests begging for seconds and your secret recipe.",
            "steps": [
                "Select your cut of meat. Food safety is important when cooking raw meat, so find a fresh pink rack of ribs at your local grocery store. Many people choose to smoke with St. Louis style (spare) ribs, which come from near the belly on the pig.[1] They are substantial and tasty — very easy to cook. If you like, you can also select baby-back ribs, which come from the back side, near the loin.\n\n\nSince baby back ribs are a little less substantial, they're harder to smoke while still keeping them juicy and tender. Adjust this recipe if you do decide to use baby back ribs; the cooking time will lower significantly.",
                "Remove the thick, sinewy membrane on the back of the ribs. With a fingernail or a knife, work your way under the light membrane on the back of the ribs. Grab a hold of the loosened membrane with a paper towel and pry it from the ribs. Much of it should come off in one fell swoop. Discard.",
                "Spot-check the ribs for any substantial bits of fat and remove. With a sharp knife, remove any excess fat that's still clinging to your ribs. Although a little fat is fine and will probably render off during the cooking process, eating a chewy hunk of fat when you're expecting a tender morsel of meat is not the most pleasant experience. A little bit of extra preparation during this step will make the eating experience a lot nicer in the end.",
                "Make your rub. A dry rub is a spice mix that coats the rack of ribs and provides complementary flavor to the meat's natural taste. Dry rubs can be made any number of ways (dehydration, spice-mixing, etc.) and using any number of recipes.[2] Explore different recipes and variations to suit your own tastes, or use this very basic dry rub[3] as a springboard for your own invention:\n\n\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup paprika\n3 tablespoons black pepper\n3 tablespoons coarse salt\n2 teaspoons garlic powder\n2 teaspoons onion powder\n2 teaspoon celery seeds\n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
                "Apply your rub generously over the entire rack of ribs, coating it evenly. Don't be stingy with your dry rub. Even if you're planning on smothering your ribs with a wet sauce later on in the cooking process, it helps to have the ribs nice and coated early on in the process, when the bulk of the cooking happens. Use 1-2 tablespoons of dry rub at least per pound of meat.",
                "Let your ribs come to room temperature while you set up. After applying the rub, let the meat start to soak up some of the delicious spices you've acquainted it with. (Meat, meet spice; spice, meet meat.) This does two things in particular:\n\n\nIt allows the dry rub to start penetrating the meat, permeating it with flavor.\nIt allows for a juicier rack of ribs. When salt hits meat, it brings moisture out to the surface. If you apply your rub and cook right away, the moisture brought out to the surface will leave your precious pork. If you apply your rub and let the meat rest, however, the moisture journeys back into the meat through a process called osmosis.[4] This process produces consistently juicier meat.",
                "Start your smoker. If you have a smoker, heat it to about 225° F (107° C) along the cooking surface, and validate it with a standard cooking thermometer. It may be hotter in the core of the fire, but ensure that the surface is set as close to 225° as possible.\n\n\nTo get your fire going, you may use charcoal and any sort of a variety of wood. Some people prefer different types of wood for different types of flavor, so find what works for you.",
                "If you don't have a smoker, improvise. Use a gas grill set on 225° F as your improvised smoker. First, set a pan of water 3/4 full underneath the grate on which you'll be cooking your ribs. This helps with cooking and helps keep the temperature down.[5] Next, make a smoker pouch by wrapping wood chips in aluminum foil and then puncturing the foil several times with a knife to let the smoke escape. Place this at the bottom of the grill but not directly underneath the ribs.\n\n\nRemember to soak your wood chips for at least 30 minutes prior to creating your smoker pouch. Wet chips will release their signature smoke better and longer than dried-out chips.\nChoose from any number of wood chips for smoking. Choose from among applewood, cedar, hickory, maple, mesquite, oak, pecan, and many more.[6]",
                "Smoke your ribs at 225° F for 3 hours. It normally takes about 6 hours to fully smoke a rack of ribs, so if you want to just smoke them, leave them in there for about 6 hours, giving them a liquid spray (apple juice, beer, even water) about every hour. Otherwise, this is only the first step of the process. During these first 3 hours, what you're really trying to do is imbue your meat with some smoky flavor and get the cooking process started.",
                "Remove the ribs from your smoker or grill and baste generously with barbecue sauce. You can use any store-bough barbecue sauce you'd like, or you can decide to make your own. Whatever you decide, slather the barbecue sauce onto the meat-side of your ribs generously.",
                "Wrap your rack in aluminum foil and add some liquid. Many people choose to add beer to their ribs — flavorful beer, not light or watery beer — but if you don't want to use beer, you can also add a bit of apple juice instead.\n\n\nSeal up the ribs and the accompanying liquid as airtight as possible while still leaving room for the meat to breathe. Ideally, you don't want moisture leaking out of your aluminum foil enclosure, so make sure it's wrapped securely.",
                "Cook your ribs at 225° F for approximately 2 hours. This part of the cooking process begins to break down the collagen present in the ribs, leaving you with ribs that are fall-off-the-bone delicious.",
                "Remove the aluminum foil, baste the ribs (if necessary) with barbecue sauce, and cook uncovered for 30 minutes to an hour. Check on the ribs after 30 minutes, though they may need longer. (Remember though, you can always cook meat longer, but you can't take doneness away.) This final stint in the oven will firm your ribs up and should leave them ready to be devoured.",
                "Enjoy. Enjoy your ribs next to some corn on the cob and coleslaw for a heart dish that screams summer."

Realize that in radio electronics, you get what you pay for. A scanner from one of the aforementioned brands will outperform a no-name brand that claims airline coverage. Most scanners pick up the entirety of the aircraft band. You can also listen to air traffic control facilities from around the world at websites including liveatc.net, globalair.com, airnav.com and radioreference.com",
                "Memorize some of the basic frequencies.\n\n\n121.5 is the emergency frequency. If there is some sort of emergency, pilots will transmit on it. You could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes.\n122.750 MHz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications\n123.025 MHz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications\n123.450 MHz is the \"unofficial\" frequency for air to air communications\nSearch 122.0-123.65 for Unicom (uncontrolled airports) and air to air communications.\nSearch 128.825-132.000 MHz for ARINC frequencies (airlines, corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel, parking, and other requests).",
                "Find an aeronautical sectional chart. You most likely want to be looking for a chart of your local area from the closest airport. Older versions of these charts will usually work just fine. Online sectional charts for your local area are available on www.skyvector.com",
                "Find the closest airport on the chart. Airports are denoted by blue or magenta circles, with lines inside representing runways. Next to the circle is a block of text with the airport name and information about that airport. The control tower frequency is denoted by CT - 000.0, where the following numbers indicate the frequency used by ATC. For example, the frequency for Wittman Regional airport in Oshkosh, WI is CT - 118.5.",
                "If the airport is uncontrolled (no tower) or the tower operates part time, a C in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). A star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower. At this type of airport, pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions.",
                "All controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles, while uncontrolled airports are magenta. Airports with runways over 8,000 feet (2,438.4 m) are not enclosed in circles and simply have a diagram depicting the runway layout, which is outlined in blue (controlled) or magenta (uncontrolled).",
                "Some airports have AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System), ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System), or ATIS (Automated Terminal Information Service) frequencies listed on the chart. These are automated or repeating broadcasts that provide pilots with weather and airport information as they prepare to land or depart.",
                "If you have access to an airport/facility directory, you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart. At larger airports, pilots receive their flight plan clearances from a \"clearance delivery\" frequency, communicate on taxiways with a \"ground\" frequency, and get takeoff and landing clearance from the \"tower\" frequency. Once pilots are airborne, they will talk to an \"approach/departure\" frequency, and once in route, they might even talk to a \"center\" frequency. If you are lucky or live close enough to an airport, you might be able to receive several of these frequencies.",
                "If a controller gives a pilot an instruction, he or she will prefix it with the aircraft's identification number. For commercial flights, this will just be the flight number, such as United 2311. A smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail.",
                "After the flight number, the controller will give an instruction such as \"enter downwind.\" This instructs the pilot to enter the traffic pattern at a specific location. The pilot will then read back the instruction, so the controller can verify that it was understood correctly.",
                "Sometimes, controllers will \"hand off\" a pilot to another frequency. An example would be a controller saying, \"November-12345, contact Approach on 124.32, good day.\" Once again, the pilot will read back the instruction.",
                "Operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal. Most of the time, pilots will broadcast blind transmissions to anyone on the frequency, announcing their position or intentions. Words like \"upwind, crosswind, downwind, base, and final\" denote specific positions in the traffic pattern.",
                "Learn the phonetic alphabet. Pilots and controllers use it to communicate letters, since they can often be confused. You might also hear someone use \"niner\" to communicate \"nine,\" \"fife\" to communicate \"five,\" or \"tree\" to communicate \"three.\""

        "wikiHow to Make Money Online Without a Website": {
            "intro": "Building a website and attracting traffic to earn advertising revenue is a proven way to earn money online. However, for those who do not want the trouble of creating or maintaining a website, there are ways to make significant amounts of money online without one. This article covers a few of the more common ways of doing this.",
            "steps": [
                "Teach online classes. Certain websites allow skilled or knowledgable people to record lessons that others can pay to view. The teachers then can participate in forums to help their students through difficult parts of their content. Doing this not only allows you to share your skills with other people, but also earns a steady stream of income if many people participate in your class.[1]",
                "Sell your hand-made goods online. People love buying interesting crafts and hand-made objects. Online stores like Etsy allow creative and crafty people to make money by selling their products. Be sure to enter the marketplace with something that differentiates your product from other offerings already available on the site.",
                "Sell your skills. There are a number of sites that connect skilled individuals with people in need of those skills. Whether you are a graphic designer, lawyer, or translator, you can find someone willing to pay you a reasonable amount for your work. Try searching for \"freelance work online\" and check out the first few results.",
                "Write an eBook. While it may seem like a daunting task to write an entire book, Ebooks do not need to be long to be informative and valuable. You just have to figure out what you know how to do that others would want to know and organize your information in book format. Of course the actual writing process will take time, but with online publishing services, publishing and selling your eBook will be a breeze.[2]\n\nYour eBook can be easily published using a variety of online publishing services, such as those hosted by Google, Amazon, and Barnes and Noble. At each site you can submit your book and, once it is approved, will be listed for sale. Because your book is digital, the copies cost you nothing to sell.\nExcluding time to write and convert to eBook format, you may earn a profit. However, average revenues from an ebook are less than $300. There are lots of competitors, many of whom spend hours promoting their books. So you may earn money from this venture, but don't expect to bring in a huge profit.",
                "Create YouTube Videos. YouTube allows content creators to earn money from advertising based on how many views they receive. The payout isn't much, about $1–$3 per 1000 views, but that can add up quickly with as you post more videos and gain more viewers. An added benefit here is that you can create videos about whatever you want, as long as you think others will want to watch it.\n\n\nBe aware that videos, like eBooks, are unlikely to bring in much money. You face an enormous amount of competition, and it's pretty unlikely your videos will be viewed by anyone other than family and friends.",
                "Complete online surveys. There is a market for people willing to take various types of surveys provided by organizations and corporations. The pay is relatively low per survey, but doing a lot of them will net you a reasonable payout. Be advised that some of these survey sites pay in gift certificates or other non-cash forms of payment.[3]",
                "Become a virtual assistant. Another option is to become an online assistant for someone who lacks the time to complete simple tasks. These tasks could include writing emails, purchasing gifts, or making dinner reservations. This certainly could be among the most interesting ways to make money online. However, many of these assistants work full-time and this would require you to constantly be available for your employer during the day.[4]",
                "Work for Amazon's Mechanical Turk. This program allows you to quickly complete small tasks that Amazon's automated computers are unable to do, such as describing the color of a shirt. Each task only takes a few seconds, but also only earns a few cents for the worker. With practice and focus though, some workers are able to make up to minimum wage.[5]",
                "Sell products on eBay on consignment. Selling on eBay doesn't always mean selling your own stuff or even buying the products at all. Many sellers make a business of selling on consignment and keeping a portion of the sale price. This can be done from home or with a brick and mortar store. Another option is to become an eBay trading assistant and do consignment work directly for eBay. See How to Make Money on eBay Selling Consignment for Others.",
                "Become a wholesaler. A wholesaler buys products in bulk at a low rate and earns money by reselling that product to buyers at a higher rate. While many wholesalers have their own website, others run businesses directly through Amazon or other online retailers. Consider the market for your product, potential earnings, and inventory storage before deciding to become a wholesaler. See How to Buy Wholesale for more information on how to get started.\n\n\nSell products through drop shipping. This process is essentially a simplified version of wholesaling, but instead of taking control of the inventory yourself, you simply sell the products and allow a third party to fulfill your order for you. That is, when your item is purchased from the online retailer where you've registered it (eBay, Amazon, etc.), the manufacturer takes care of shipping your product to the buyer. This reduces the risks of leftover inventory and complicated logistics that are common in wholesaling. [6]",
                "Find an affiliate product to promote. You will act as a middleman between the producer of the product and the consumer without ever touching the product. Be sure to choose a product that you believe is in demand and underrepresented by current advertising.[7] You will need to buy a domain name, but you will not need to set up a website, as your domain name will redirect people to the product's website.\n\n\nGenerally, you will get the biggest commissions on digital products. Digital products are defined as something that is downloaded directly to a customer's computer after purchasing, like electronic books or software. Since there is no extra cost per unit, no inventory and no shipping, the commissions are much greater than on regular \"physical\" goods. The most common commission on digital products is 50%.\nSign up for an affiliate membership site as a reseller. This will allow you to build a residual income and the retention rate is much higher than just selling a product once and getting paid. After you sign up, you will get a unique affiliate link where you need to send people to purchase the product. Your affiliate link will have a special code that will tell the product owner that it's you who referred the customer. The affiliate link code will allow your commissions to be tracked correctly and assigned to you.",
                "Get a domain name to redirect to your affiliate link. These can be purchased cheaply from a hosting website. It's important to note that unlike having your own website you don't have to pay for hosting which is usually more expensive than buying and registering a domain name. [8]\n\nWhen someone types in your domain in their browser, it will go to your affiliate link. The visitor will see the website with the product you promote, and the commissions will be tracked correctly.\nThe reason why you need a domain name is that it's memorable and it makes you look more trustworthy. Affiliate links tend to be too long and arouse suspicion. For example, most people would rather click on the link bestwidgets.com as opposed to abcwidgets.com?reseller=john.",
                "Increase traffic going through your domain. In order to make sales, you need to get visitors to your domain name (which will forward them to the website of the product that you resell). You can pay for advertising and hope that your profit will be greater than advertising cost, or you can use free ways to generate traffic.[9]\n\nThe most effective way to get free targeted visitors to your domain name is by writing and submitting articles. You can write short articles on the topic related to the product that you promote and include your domain name at the end. You will then submit your articles to various websites, and allow them to publish your articles as long as your link is included. Your articles may be published in many places on the Internet (depending upon quality and relevance of the article to the website owner), and will be advertising your affiliate link at no cost to you whatsoever. People will read your articles, like what you have to say and click on your domain name link ready to buy."

While it may seem like a dream job, becoming a professional driver takes years of experience and a good deal of financial investment to climb the ranks to Formula 1. By knowing the steps required to becoming a Formula 1 racer, you can fully assess the risks and rewards to decide if the sport is right for you.",
            "steps": [
                "Take a class at a racing school. This is the quickest way to find out if Formula 1 is right for you. It is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. You will get to get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.[1] These classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge, but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about Formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.\n\n\nYou must have a valid standard driver's license to take these classes, and if you are a minor you will also need parental consent.\nYou must be capable of driving a car with a manual transmission to take racing classes.",
                "Enroll in a racing program. These programs will involve approximately 1-2 weeks of advanced classes to hone your racing skills. Since your goal is to race in Formula One, you likely want to select a school that is approved by the licensing organization.",
                "Get your racing license. Upon completion of the required courses your school will send a letter of recommendation to a racing organization. This will enable you to register and compete in a racing school event.",
                "Enter an amateur school race series. These entry level race events are a great opportunity for amateur drivers to showcase their skills and get the attention of potential sponsors. Some schools hold their own races and will even provide you a car for these race events. You can win scholarships and race points towards getting your next level license.",
                "Try kart racing. This method is the best way for younger racers to get involved in the sport. Most of the top Formula 1 drivers all started off racing carts. Buying a kart can be costly, so you may just want to visit a local kart track and try it out first.",
                "Get a kart racing license. Some organizations will give any beginner that applies a license so they can start entry level races to learn the sport. To get into more serious races, you will need to continue to apply for higher licenses. You may need to pass a test given at an accredited school, or show proficiency at racing at your current level before being allowed to move up.",
                "Buy your kart. If you are going to race you need some wheels. There are different vehicles for different levels of race, and you will probably need to buy or rent several karts before you move up to racing cars.[2]",
                "Enter a race. Placing well in races is a big part in how quickly your racing career advances. The better you perform the sooner you will reach the next level. If you plan on getting to Formula 1, you will need to race as much as you can and always be looking to move up to the next level.",
                "Complete two years in junior single seater racing events. Formula 1 requires drivers to have a good deal of experience driving similar vehicles. While there are many possible race series that can be your path to Formula 1, all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up.[3]",
                "Turn 18 years old. Formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license. Some younger racers are good enough to be considered for Formula 1, but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age. If you are still too young, look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points.",

                "Accept an offer to drive for an F1 team. If you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. These teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. They usually sign their drivers on a season-to-season basis.",
                "Getting sponsorships. Most Formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. To attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. You may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on-track work. Racing is a very expensive sport, so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.",
                "Pay to drive in F1. Pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports, including Formula 1. Instead of being paid by the race team, the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.[4] While this isn't practical for most new racers in Formula 1, it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it."

        "wikiHow to Keep Sliced Bananas from Discoloring": {
            "intro": "As with apples and many other fruits, the flesh of a banana reacts with oxygen to turn brown when the fruit is cut.[1] Though the taste doesn't change, presentation can be affected, especially if you're featuring the bananas prominently in a fruit salad or dessert dish. Luckily, a few easy tricks make it a cinch to keep your bananas looking fresh. The simplest? Lemon juice.",
            "steps": [
                "Buy fruit juice or squeeze your own. There are several fruit juices that can keep banana slices from turning brown. You can use fresh juice or storebought varieties — it doesn't matter. See our juicing guide if you'd like to make your own. Either way, you won't need much — a half cup or so is plenty for one or two bananas.\n\n\n\nLemon juice is the most well-known juice used for keeping fruits from turning brown. It works just as well for bananas as it does for apples.[2] However, there are many other juices that work well, including:\nLime juice\nOrange juice\nTinned pineapple juice\nTinned or fresh grapefruit juice\nApple juice",
                "Coat the sliced bananas in the juice. To do this, you can sprinkle the juice over the slices or dip the slices into the juice. You can also immerse the slices in the juice and leave them there for a few minutes, allowing them to soak up some of the juice. This can be great for keeping them fresh-looking but may affect their taste a little more than normal.\n\n\nAnother quick way to coat the bananas is to put them in a sealed plastic bag with the juice and gently turn it over a few times.\nTo minimize any change to the flavor of the bananas, use the juice sparingly or place it in a spray bottle and spritz it over the slices.",
                "Use or store the bananas. Once they're soaked in fruit juice, the bananas will take much longer to turn brown. Whether you're eating the slices raw or making a pie, fruit kabobs, a parfait, or a fruit salad, you can trust that your bananas will look fresh well through the end of the meal. They should even last without refrigeration in a plastic container for a few hours — perfect for packed lunches.\n\n\nEven with the fruit juice, banana slices are best consumed the same day. The cold temperatures of refrigerators can turn the peels brown, but if you're OK with this, the fruit itself should remain fresh.[3] If you do refrigerate the slices, be sure to put them in an airtight container with as little air in it as possible.",
                "Revive discolored banana slices with pineapple or grapefruit juice. If your banana slices are already brown, all is not lost. You can lighten discolored banana slices by immersing them in tinned pineapple juice or grapefruit juice for 10-15 minutes. They won't quite return to their original pale yellow color, but they will look fresher and more delicious.",
                "Use soda water. Fruit juice isn't the only thing that can keep bananas from turning an unappealing brown. For example, soda water and club soda are known for their ability to keep sliced fruit fresh.[4] Best of all, these liquids have the added benefit that they don't affect the taste of banana. Use them as you would use fruit juices, soaking the slices in the soda water before serving or storing them.\n\n\nBe sure to use soda water or club soda. Tonic water, a beverage that looks the same, has a strong flavor that doesn't go well with bananas.",
                "Use tap water. Tap water doesn't work quite as well as fruit juice or the other solutions in this article, but it's something you'll always have available and it's basically free.[5] This, too, is used the same as the fruit juices: soak the banana slices in the water before using them how you wish.",
                "Use diluted citric acid. Citric acid (the same chemical that makes citrus fruits like lemons sour) is sold in a purified form as a canning additive. In this form, it is specifically used to keep fruit from discoloring as it stores. However, it's often difficult to find pure citric acid. Your best bet will usually be a health food store or a hardware store. Luckily, it is not especially expensive — less than $10 for a small bottle is common.[6]\n\nTo use citric acid, add three teaspoons to a cup of water and mix. Soak the slices in the bath as normal. Don't use undiluted citric acid, as it is far too sour.",
                "Use diluted vinegar. Vinegar can be used similarly to citric acid to keep fruit fresh. However, its strong sourness also makes it necessary to dilute it. As with citric acid, add a few teaspoons to a cup of water to make a bath and soak the banana pieces as normal.",
                "Use dissolved vitamin C. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is another acid that can keep fruit from turning brown. Powdered vitamin C can usually be found in most supermarkets as a cold-fighting supplement. Dissolve this in water (according to the directions on the package) to make a bath and soak the banana slices as normal.\n\n\nIf you're in a pinch, a ground-up vitamin C tablet works as well.",
                "Limit exposure to air. Since banana slices turn brown when they are exposed to the oxygen in the air, keeping the fruit from physically touching the air will prevent the browning reaction from occurring. There are many ways to do this. A few are listed below.\n\n\nOne easy trick involves wax paper. Cut the slices so that they are all about the same slice, then lay them on a tray. Cut a square of wax paper to fit the tray, then lay it down over the slices and gently press it down so it sticks to each. The banana slices will be sandwiched between the paper and the tray without any air exposure.\nIf you have the time, you can also cut small squares of wax paper of plastic wrap and lay them individually over each slice. Be sure to remove them before you eat.[7]\n\nIf you have a vacuum storage device (e.g., Food Saver, etc.), you can also try packing the slices in an air-free container."

        "How to Diagnose Kidney Failure in Cats": {
            "intro": "In cats over the age of 7 years with kidney disease, having the disease is part of the natural aging process. In animals less than 4 years of age, kidney problems are more likely to be the result of a genetic predisposition. The kidney has many jobs to do, but most important of these is filtering natural toxins out of the blood stream and reclaiming water that would otherwise be lost in the urine. Therefore, it is important to be sensitive to the signs of kidney failure so the cat can be diagnosed and treated as efficiently as possible.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the difficulties surrounding early detection. The kidneys have a huge reserve capacity and it isn't until at least 75% of total kidney function is lost that the cat shows clinical signs of a problem.\n\n\nThus, by the time a diagnosis can be reached the cat is coping on a maximum of 25% of the renal capacity when healthy. (This sounds alarming, but remember when people donate a kidney, they automatically lose 50% of their renal capacity and yet do not become ill).\nUnfortunately, as total kidney function declines, the nephrons (the individual filtration units contained in the kidneys) which are still working are asked to work harder and so their demise is hastened. It is therefore important to identify renal disease in the cat are early as possible because early treatment extends the life of the remaining nephrons.\nHowever, early detection is problematic because blood screening is relatively insensitive up to the point where 75% damage has occurred. Many vet clinics offer routine yearly, or six-monthly screening programs for senior (over the age of 7 years) cats.\nMany cats’ kidneys can compensate even if as many as 90% of the nephrons in their kidneys are destroyed. This will delay a diagnosis if the owner is not looking for signs of kidney failure or it may seem like the symptoms are just a part of the cat getting older",
                "Watch your cat carefully for symptoms. Kidney failure is usually accompanied by a range of symptoms. The symptoms occur as the body adapts in order to minimize the effects of kidney disease.\n\n\nAs an owner you may notice little changes in your cat early on, such as the need to fill the water bowl more often, or empty the litter tray more regularly. These are signs that the cat is drinking more, a sign which should never be ignored.\nHowever, many of the signs associated with renal disease overlap with other conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, pancreatitis, or infections. This means that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on symptoms alone, but they are a strong hint that further steps need to be taken to get to the bottom of the problem.",
                "Look for signs of increased thirst. You may notice if your cat develops unusual habits such as drinking from the toilet or if the water bowl constantly needs topping up. Increased thirst happens as a result of the kidney losing its ability to recycle water from the blood stream.\n\n\nThe body loses water through the urine, which is more dilute, and so this water needs to be replaced, causing increased thirst in the cat.",
                "Take note of whether the cat is urinating more often. Because the cat is drinking more and is not able to concentrate her urine as well, the volume of urine produced is larger. This means the bladder fills more often and the cat needs to urinate more often to stay comfortable.\n\n\nCardinal signs are needing to clean the litter tray more often, or a break down in house training habits, such as urinating outside of the litterbox.",
                "Watch the cat for signs of dehydration. Even though the cat drinks more, there is often an imbalance between water loss and water taken in, which results in the gradual development of dehydration.\n\n\nVeterinarians assess this during a physical examination by looking at how quickly the scruff springs back to its normal position. To do this, gently grasp a piece of scruff over the shoulder blades, between the finger and thumb of one hand. Lift the scruff 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) away from the backbone and release it.\nIn a well-hydrated animal the scruff springs straight back into the normal position. In a dehydrated animal the skin loses elasticity which means it returns slowly to the resting position. If the skin takes over a second to slip back down then the cat is probably dehydrated.",
                "Identify any weight loss. As part of the kidneys impaired ability to filter, large molecules such as protein tend to leak through the kidneys and be lost in the urine. Protein loss represents an important waste of calories.\n\n\nAnother reason for weight loss is that the buildup of natural toxins often makes the cat feel nauseous, which reduces her appetite.\nA cat that is usually overweight will suddenly become lighter, or a normal weight cat will lose muscle mass. The fat pad between the cat’s legs will also become saggy as it loses the fat deposits.",
                "Sniff your cat's breath. Cats get bad breath for many reasons, including rotten teeth, gum infections, diabetes mellitus, diet, and kidney failure. In kidney disease it is the toxins that cause the bad breath and this is described as having a typical ammonia-like smell.\n\n\nThis smell is not always easy to detect and some people's noses seem better tuned to pick up ammonia smells than others.",
                "Check for oral ulcers. The same toxins that cause bad breath also damage tissues and cause ulceration in the mouth and stomach lining. Of these, you can see the ulcers in the mouth. They tend to form along the margins of the tongue, or where the teeth meet the gum, and they may cause the cat to drool.\n\n\nAgain, ulcers do form for other reasons such as viral infections or if the cat has licked a caustic substance, but it remains a sign that needs to be taken note of.",
                "Identify any muscle wastage. Ultimately, when protein loss exceeds intake from the diet, the cat's muscle starts to break up to provide her with the necessary protein requirements.\n\n\nCats with kidney failure are typically thin, with dull coats and wasted muscles.",
                "Watch for vomiting and a poor appetite. Gastric ulcers caused by a buildup of toxins make the cat nauseous. This results in vomiting and a reluctance to eat.",
                "Feel the cat's kidney size. Scar tissue causes the kidneys to shrink and failing kidneys typically feel smaller than usual. Especially in thin cats, the kidneys are easy to feel in their location sitting beneath the lumbar vertebra (lower back).\n\n\nGauging their relative size is a subjective measurement and a skill that veterinarians acquire over the years. Don't try to feel your cat's kidneys at home.\nA normal kidney is usually equivalent in length to that of three lumbar vertebrae, and shrunken kidneys measure less than two lumbar vertebrae in length.",
                "Look for kidney symmetry and shape. Scar tissue forms fairly uniformly throughout the kidney and so the surface of the kidney feels smooth and both feel equally shrunken. However, cancerous kidneys often feel knobbly with a rough, bumpy surface.\n\n\nThe latter is an important indication for kidney biopsy because some renal cancers are amenable to chemotherapy, whereas old age kidney deterioration is not.",
                "Measure the cat's blood pressure. The kidney breaks down several hormones that control blood pressure. When the kidney is not working properly the levels of these hormones rise which creates an increased risk of high blood pressure o hypertension.\n\n\nOn physical examination the veterinarian may see telltale signs of hemorrhage on the retina, or even spot detached retinas, which are a common consequence of hypertension.\nOnce again, high pressure is not diagnostic of kidney failure, but a strong clue that needs to be followed up on. The blood pressure cuff used to measure your cat’s blood pressure is similar to the one used to measure human blood pressure. 120/80 is considered a normal blood pressure for your cat.[1]",
                "Do a dipstick urine analysis. Urine analysis is an extremely valuable tool for assessing renal health, especially in the early stages of kidney disease. A simple dipstick test can quickly rule out conditions which cause increased thirst such as diabetes, if no glucose is present.\n\n\nA dipstick test also gives a rough indication of the protein content of the urine. A high protein level can result from a urine infection (in which case blood is commonly present in the urine) or kidney disease.\nIf blood is present the clinician will suggest either treating preemptively with antibiotics, or sending the urine for culture. Only once the blood has cleared can a decision be reached that the protein is because of leakage from the kidney.\nYour cat’s veterinarian may also want to perform an Early Renal Damage (ERD) test, which checks your cat’s urine for the presence of microalbuminuria.[2]",
                "Try a specific gravity urine test. Specific gravity is a measure of how dilute or how concentrated the urine is. Cats are very efficient at concentrating their urine, in order to preserve water.\n\n\nSpecific gravity is measured relative to water (which is SG 1.000). A healthy urine SG is between 1.035 – 1.060. Urine below SG 1.035 is considered abnormally dilute. Urine SG below 1.025 is significantly dilute.\nDilute urine should contain very little protein, thus a result of a low SG and high protein level is an indicator that the kidneys are not concentrating urine and are leaking protein. This is an important pointer towards kidney disease, which can be detected before changes are evident in the blood test.",
                "Test the urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC). This test measures the ratio of protein in urine to another naturally occurring metabolite called creatinine. The normal value in the cat is below 0.4. Ratios above 1.0 indicate significant protein loss which needs investigating.",
                "Take a sample of the cat's blood for blood testing. Blood tests play an important role in identifying cats that have lost over 75% of their functional kidney capacity. Most useful for diagnosing kidney failure are three indicators: blood urea, creatinine, and phosphate levels.\n\n\n\nBlood Urea: Normal blood urea levels in the cat are less than 32mg/ml and levels above 35mg/ml are considered to be high. Whilst raised urea in the blood is an indicator of kidney failure, it can be high for other reasons. Therefore raised urea levels alone are not sufficient to diagnose renal failure.\n\nBlood Creatinine: The normal level in cats is below 130 umol/l. Any reading above 130 umol/l is likely to indicate renal disease. Creatinine is a waste product of protein breakdown and is only excreted by the kidneys.\n\nPhosphate levels: The kidney finds it difficult to excrete phosphate and when kidney function fails the levels of phosphate in the blood stream rise. Normal levels are below 2.6mmol/l. Unfortunately, high blood phosphate levels cause further kidney damage and so a vicious circle of poor kidney function leading to phosphate retention, which then causes further damage.",
                "Do a test to distinguish between kidney disease and dehydration. High levels of urea, creatinine and phosphate is a strong indication of kidney disease. However, raised results do not necessary tell the clinician whether the problem lies within the kidney (i.e. true kidney failure) or if the kidney is under strain because of another condition such as dehydration.\n\n\nTo investigate whether the problem is pre-renal (caused by dehydration) or renal, the clinician often suggests rehydrating the cat by putting her on an intravenous drip for 2-3 days, and then repeating the blood tests at the end of this time.\nIf in the fully rehydrated cat the results are now normal, this indicates the kidney is probably functioning normally but was under severe stress. If however the results remain raised in the hydrated cat, kidney failure is likely.",
                "Perform a kidney biopsy only if renal cancer is suspected. Kidney biopsy plays a limited role in the diagnosis of kidney failure. The main indication for kidney biopsy is when renal cancer is suspected, in which case a definitive diagnosis as to the type of cancer can indicate whether chemotherapy would be beneficial or not.\n\n\nThe majority of renal cancers present with either large kidneys, or kidneys with knobbly surfaces – which contrasts sharply with the small, smooth feel of kidneys with renal failure.\nWith the exception of kidney cancer, most causes of renal failure are treated in the same way. Putting the cat through the extra stress of an anesthetic and a surgical procedure in order to reach a precise diagnosis which is largely of academic interest is therefore not warranted."

            "intro": "Hyperventilation occurs when a person over-breathes, inhaling and exhaling very quickly and shallowly. Generally, panic attacks or anxiety will result in a person hyperventilating. However there are some additional and possibly serious medical conditions that can also cause someone to hyperventilate. Hyperventilation can cause some unsettling effects on the body which may even increase the feelings of panic or anxiety, leading to further hyperventilation. By learning more about the causes and symptoms of hyperventilation you can help restore your natural breathing rhythm.",
            "steps": [
                "Discover the symptoms. It may be the case that even during an episode of hyperventilation a person may be unaware that they are over-breathing. Since most cases of hyperventilation are caused by fear, anxiety, or panic it may be difficult to notice specific symptoms. Pay careful attention to your symptoms during such states to see if they are indicative of hyperventilation.[1]\n\nFast or increased rate of breathing.\nConfusion, dizziness, and light-headedness may be present during hyperventilation.\nWeakness, numbness or tingling in the arms or mouth, and muscle spasms in the hands and feet can also occur with hyperventilation.\nPalpitations and chest pain may be noticeable during hyperventilation.",
                "Understand the causes. The main causes of hyperventilation are states of panic or anxiety which increase the rate of breathing in a person. This over-breathing results in unusually low levels of carbon dioxide in the body. Altering these carbon dioxide levels cause the typical symptoms that come with hyperventilating.[2]\n\nHyperventilation can also be done at will, purposefully over-breathing.\nSome medical issues such as infection, blood loss, or heart and lung disorders can cause hyperventilation.",
                "Visit with your doctor to learn more. To accurately and safely diagnose hyperventilation you will need to speak with your doctor to learn more. Your doctor will be able to help you discover the causes, triggers, and best treatment plans related to your own unique case.[3]\n\nIf your hyperventilation is caused by anxiety or panic attacks your doctor can help you with these issues directly.\nHyperventilation may be indicative of another medical issue that your doctor can diagnose and work towards treating.",
                "Find a paper bag to use. Breathing into a paper bag can be a useful method when managing the symptoms of a hyperventilation episode. By breathing into a paper bag you can help reuse carbon-dioxide that would normally be lost on your exhalation, maintaining proper levels in the body and avoiding the symptoms of hyperventilation.[4]\n\nDo not use plastic bags as these can pose a choking hazard.\nMake sure the paper bag is clean and there are no small items inside that could be accidentally inhaled.\nBe sure that your doctor has cleared you for this technique as it can be dangerous to use when hyperventilation is caused by a physical injury or disease.",
                "Place the paper bag over your mouth and nose. In order to properly use the paper bag breathing method during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to make sure that it completely covers your mouth and nose. This will ensure that the carbon-dioxide is caught in the paper bag, allowing you to re-breathe it and reduce some of the effects caused by hyperventilating.[5]\n\nHold the bag with one hand towards the opening of the bag.\nPinching the bag slightly can help shape the opening of the bag, allowing it to fit over your mouth and nose more easily.\nPlace the opening of the bag directly and completely over your mouth and nose.",
                "Breathe in and out of the bag. Once you have placed the paper bag over your mouth and nose you can begin breathing in and out of the bag. Try to remain calm and breathe as naturally and completely as you can during an episode of hyperventilation.[6]\n\nTake no more than six to 12 breaths using the paper bag.\nBreathe as slowly and easily as you can.\nAfter taking six to 12 breaths remove the bag from your mouth and nose and breathe without it.",
                "Lie on your back and relax. To start your practice of retraining your breathing you will need to rest comfortably on your back and relax your body. Relaxing the entire body will help you focus entirely on your breathing and let you get the most out of your breath training.[7]\n\nTake off any tight or restrictive clothing such as a belt or tie.\nYou can try putting pillows under your knees or back for extra comfort.",
                "Put something over your stomach. Breathing during an episode of hyperventilation is generally shallow, at the chest level, and rapid. You will be working to retrain your breathing to have more rhythmic and complete inhalations using your stomach and diaphragm. By placing an object on your stomach you help keep the focus on this area and provide resistance to strengthen the muscles responsible for abdominal breathing.[8]\n\nYou can place something like a telephone book on your stomach while you retrain your breathing.\nAvoid any items that are too heavy or are an unusual shape. These can either cause injury or be difficult to balance on your stomach.",
                "Breathe using your stomach. After you are comfortably laying down and have a suitable object placed on your stomach you can begin to retrain your breathing. The goal here is to raise and lower the item on your stomach, using your abdomen like a balloon. Keep the following in mind as you practice this new way of breathing:[9]\n\nBreathe through your nose when practicing. If you can't breathe through your nose you can purse your lips and breathe through your mouth.\nTake comfortable and rhythmic breaths.\nBreathe smoothly and try to avoid pauses on the inhalation or exhalation.\nOnly your abdomen should be moving. Keep the rest of your body relaxed.",
                "Keep practicing. In order to get the most out of this new method of breathing you will need to get regular practice. By practicing you will become more comfortable using this method of breathing, allowing you to avoid hyperventilating during a stressful time.[10]\n\nPractice for at least five to 10 minutes a day.\nGradually slow your rate of breathing during your practice sessions.\nBegin practicing this way of breathing while sitting up or walking.\nEventually you will want to use this method right before you expect a panic attack or during one.",
                "Consider medication. If your hyperventilation is caused by panic or anxiety related issues your doctor may prescribe medications to treat your anxiety. These medications work to reduce the effects of anxiety and panic attacks, in turn reducing the instances of hyperventilation. Talk with your doctor to learn more about the medications used to treat anxiety and panic attacks.[11]\n\nSSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly prescribed antidepressants.\nSNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are FDA approved as a antidepressants.\nBe aware that medications can take weeks before effects are noticeable.\nBenzodiazepines are usually given only for short term use as they are habit forming over time.",
                "Work with a psychotherapist. Hyperventilation related to panic and anxiety disorders can sometimes be treated by a psychotherapist. Your psychotherapist will work with you to uncover and cope with any underlying psychological issues that may be responsible for panic or anxiety-related issues and the hyperventilation they can cause.[12]\n\nMost psychotherapists will use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you move beyond the physical sensations caused by panic or anxiety.\nPsychotherapy sessions can take time before the effects are noticeable. Sticking with the process for several months will help ensure that your symptoms decrease or disappear completely.",
                "Contact your doctor in an emergency. Hyperventilation can indicate a serious issue and there are some cases in which you will want to contact your doctor or seek emergency services. If you notice any of the following aspects in regards to your hyperventilation seek immediate medical attention:[13]\n\nIf this is your first time experiencing rapid breathing.\nIf you are in pain and hyperventilating.\nIf you have an injury or fever and are hyperventilating.\nIf your hyperventilating gets worse.\nIf your hyperventilating is accompanied by other symptoms.",
                "Notice the signs of hyperventilation. Before you can help someone during an episode of hyperventilation you will need to assess his condition. Generally, the signs will be apparent; however, you will need to be sure that he is in fact hyperventilating in order to help him properly.[14]\n\nHyperventilation will usually be characterized by very fast, shallow, chest level breathing.\nThe person will generally appear to be in a state of panic.\nSpeech will be difficult for the person.\nMuscle spasms in the person's hands may be visible.",
                "Reassure the other person. If you think someone is hyperventilating you can help by offering your reassurance that she is going to be fine. Often times hyperventilating can cause even more panic during a panic attack, resulting in an increasing cycle and worsening symptoms. Calm reassurance can help lower the amount of panic the person is feeling and restore normal breathing rates.[15]\n\nRemind her that she is having a panic attack and that she is not experiencing something life-threatening, such as a heart attack.\nKeep your tone calm, relaxed, and gentle.\nLet her know that you are there with her and are not going to leave her.",
                "Help the person to increase his carbon-dioxide levels. During an episode of hyperventilation, carbon-dioxide levels fall in the body and can cause symptoms typically associated with hyperventilating. In order to retain carbon-dioxide in the body, have the person breathe using the following methods:[16]\n\nHave him purse his lips, exhaling and inhaling through them.\nHe may also try closing the mouth and one nostril. Have him breath in and out only through one open nostril.\nIf the person appears in distress, turns blue, or complains of any pain, then emergency services should be contacted for evaluation in the ER."

        "How to Do Your Part to Prevent Animal Extinction": {
            "intro": "Scientists predict we're on the verge of the Sixth Mass Extinction. This is a global event in which three fourths of all species become extinct. Many scientists feel human activity is causing increased extinction rates. If you want to help, there are many small and big changes you can make. Strive for a more environmentally conscious lifestyle, get involved politically, and enlist the help of others.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Pay attention to the products you use. If you want to do your part to curb the animal extinction rate, you should avoid using products that are harmful to the environment. Many corporations harvest food and other resources in a way that negatively impacts the habitats of endangered species.\n\n\nLook for products made from recycled materials. They are often marked by a series of green arrows forming a circle. You may also find information on a product's label indicating how much of it is made from recycled materials.[2]\n\nIf you wear make-up, be conscious of which products you purchase. Many cosmetics companies are notorious for animal testing and other environmentally harmful practices. A lot of big companies, like Olay and Garnier, routinely practice animal testing. Read the labels on cosmetics, shampoos, and conditioners to make sure there is no animal testing involved.[3]\n\nMany products make use of palm tree oil. It's used in foods, cosmetics, and soaps. Many tropical forests are being stripped to make room for palm tree farms. If you see palm tree oil on the label of a product you're buying, make sure that company harvests the oil in a sustainable manner. You can find a list of companies that support ethical palm oil harvesting on the Union of Concerned Scientists website.[4]",
                "Do not buy products made from endangered species. You should never purchase products made from threatened or endangered species. Many people enjoy bringing home memorable souvenirs after overseas trips. However, many of these trinkets are made from animals in danger of extinction. Avoid products made form things like ivory, tortoise shell, and coral. You should also stay away from anything made from tiger fur or the fur of another endangered animal.[5]",
                "Buy local food. Many of the agricultural practices used by big food companies are harmful to the environment and endangered species. If you want to do your part to help, strive to buy local food. Be on the lookout for grocery stores who buy from local farmers as well as farmer's markets in your town. Smaller farms generally do less environmental damage and are often more committed to sustainable, ethical farming practices.[6]",
                "Make small energy saving changes. Reducing your overall carbon footprint can help the environment. This can protect the habitat and welfare of a variety of endangered species. Sometimes, tiny tweaks can have a big impact on how much energy and fossil fuel your household uses.\n\n\nReplace your lightbulbs. Switch to compact fluorescent bulbs, which you can buy at most supermarkets. These types of lightbulbs use significantly less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.[7]\n\nUnplug electronic gadgets when you're not using them. Even if a product is not in use, it saps electricity from an outlet just by being plugged in. Make sure to unplug kitchen appliances, like the coffee maker and the toaster, when they're not in use. You should also unplug laptop cords and phone chargers when you don't need them.[8]\n\nTurn your thermostat two degrees colder. Chances are, you won't notice the minor tweak in temperature. However, you'll be using significantly less energy if you do so. You may also save a lot on your next electricity bill.[9]",
                "Eat less meat. The meat industry has a huge impact on the environment, harming the welfare of endangered species. Rainforests, home to many endangered species, are often clear-cut to make room for factory farms. You can help by transiting into a more plant-based diet.[10]\n\nA vegetarian diet means you refrain from eating products made from animal flesh. Products like eggs, butter, and cheese are still acceptable in a vegetarian diet but you would exclude anything like chicken or beef. Protein in a vegetarian diet can come from nuts, legumes, eggs, and cheese.[11]\n\nA vegan diet excludes any products made from animals, including cheese and eggs. Many people choose to go vegan because farming practices that harvest meatless animal-based products still greatly harm the environment. As a vegan, you would get your protein solely from plant-based options like beans, nuts, and seeds.[12]\n\nYou should talk to your doctor before switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Vegans especially may have to take certain vitamins to make sure they get the necessary nutrients when not ingesting animal-based products.\nIf going vegetarian or vegan seems like a massive commitment, consider simply lessening the overall amount of meat you eat. In addition to helping the environment, eating less meat is good for your overall health.[13] You can have one or two nights a week when you try to make a vegan or vegetarian based dinner. You could also try something like only eating meat for one meal per day.",
                "Recycle and buy sustainable products. You should make an effort recycle products like cans, cardboards, and plastics. You should also try to switch over to reusable products. Go for cloth napkins over paper ones, for example, and do not buy products made from materials that are not biodegradable.",
                "Give your time to nature. The best way to help endangered species is to protect the environments where they live. Give your time to nature by visiting or volunteering at a local wildlife refuge. Such organizations always need donations and volunteers as they often lack adequate funding.\n\n\nSimply visiting a wildlife foundation can help. You can leave a donation at the entrance. You may also learn something about endangered species and the importance of protecting the environment which will allow you to better educate those around you. The more people involved with protecting endangered species, the better.[14]\n\nYou can also volunteer. Wildlife refuges often do not have a large budget at their disposal. They may rely heavily on volunteers to keep running smoothly. The next time you're at a wildlife refuge, ask a worker about volunteering.[15]",
                "Create a wildlife friendly home. Work to cultivate an environmentally friendly home. This can help save endangered species native to your area.\n\n\nIf you have pets, supervise them when they're outdoors. Do not leave cats or dogs outside overnight as they may fight and even kill birds, rodents, and other animals in your neighborhood.[16]\n\nKeep your garbage in secured cans or shelters that can lock. You do not want a wild animal to accidentally ingest something poisonous.[17]\n\nIf your garden, be environmentally conscious. Avoid the overuse of herbicides or pesticides. Go for organic pesticides over products made from synthetic chemicals.[18]",
                "Vote for political candidates who support the environment. The biggest issue in protecting endangered species is keeping their habitats safe. When voting in the next election, vote wisely. You should support candidates who run on a platform dedicated to environmental protection.\n\n\nYou should look for candidates that want to lessen dependence on fossil fuels and support more efficient farming practices. Pay attention to a potential candidate's voting record when it comes to environmental issues. You should give your vote to a candidate that has consistently supported bettering your country's environmental practices.[19]\n\nOverpopulation of humans is a major cause of environmental decay. Therefore, look for candidates who support education and healthcare for women throughout the world. Women who have access to things like birth control are less likely to have unexpected or unwanted pregnancy. Providing education and healthcare to women worldwide can curb overpopulation and help the environment.[20]",
                "Join an organization. You can also become politically involved by joining an organization dedicated to animal rights and welfare. Greenpeace, PETA, and the National Wildlife Foundation are a few organization that strive to mobilize politically to protect endangered species. You can help an organization by simply becoming a member, donating a small fee once a year. However, you can also volunteer your time and services. If you want to help endangered species, look into helping through direct action. Look up local branches of organizations dedicated to animal rights and welfare. See what opportunities there are to get involved.",
                "Use social media to your advantage. Knowledge can be an incredibly powerful tool when it comes to helping endangered species. Use social media to educate your friends and family members. If people understand the necessity of immediate action, they may be more likely to help.\n\n\nPost relevant articles on social media websites. You should both news stories that talk about abstract facts and lists that give people specific instructions on how to help. For example, you could post a list of small changes you can take to reduce your carbon footprint. You could also post recipes and articles and how to makes your favorite foods vegetarian or vegan.\nEncourage people to sign petitions. Online petitions do not often result in direct action right away, but they can help raise awareness of an issue. If politicians, other leaders, and corporations see many people care about something, they may give it more attention.\nEncourage people to call their congressperson when a vote is coming up regarding laws about animal welfare and sustainable environmental practices. If enough people call in expressing concern, you could have a real impact on how your representative votes.",
                "Talk to your friends and family members. Express your concerns to others. Education can be a powerful tool when it comes to social change. You do not need to be preachy or get insulting with people. However, you can kindly suggest small changes when the opportunity comes up. For example, propose you and co-workers car pool to work. Mention what a positive impact this might have on the environment.[21]",
                "Volunteer for organizations that help raise public awareness. Volunteering your time to organizations in need is one of the best ways to help educate the public. Some of the organizations listed above often do public awareness campaigns. You can see if you can donate your time to running a booth at an event, for example, or handing out flyers on the street.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a new job, consider seeing if you can work for an organization like National Wildlife Federation. If you have editing experience, for example, you could help write press releases and news stories informing people on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. You would be able to make money while fighting for a cause you're passionate about."

        "How to Stop Self Harming": {
            "intro": "Self-harm is when a person deliberately harms himself as a way of dealing with difficult feelings or overwhelming situations. Self-harm might make you feel better in the moment and help you cope for a short time. But in the long term, it will probably make you feel worse and can put yourself in a dangerous situation. There is no magic solution to stop self-harming. Additionally, making changes is hard and it’s easy to resort back to old behaviors. The process of recovery takes a while, so relapsing is possible. If you do, it’s important to be kind to yourself and not beat yourself up. Just beginning the process of recovery is significant.",

This could be as simple as going into the living room to be with your family or roommates. You might choose to go to a public place, like a coffee shop or a public park. Whatever you're doing, wherever you are, decide to stop before you harm yourself. Make sure to surround yourself with people.",

Many hotlines are available featuring information for people struggling with self-harm, and resources for help.\n\n\nIt is helpful to create a phone list of people you can call.\nMake sure these numbers are in your phone:\n\n1-800-273-TALK: This is a 24-hour crisis hotline if you’re about to self-harm or are in an emergency situation.\n1-800-334-HELP: This number is the Self Injury Foundation’s 24-hour national crisis line.\n1-800-DON’T-CUT: This number provides information about self-harm.\n\n\nYou can even try talking to an inanimate object, a pet, a photograph, or a poster. These objects can give you somewhere to aim your voice and won’t judge you for your actions.",
                "Get help if there is the risk of suicide. If you are thinking about suicide, get help immediately. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency response (call 911). The following are some signs to look for:[1]\n\nTalking about wanting to die or to kill yourself.\nLooking for a way to kill yourself.\nMaking statements about being hopeless.\nTalking about having no reason to live.",
                "Draw on your body with a marker. If you find your thoughts continually drifting back to harming yourself, one alternative is to draw on your body with a marker. Draw on the place where you are thinking of harming yourself. Ink won’t leave a scar.[2]",
                "Distract yourself. Distraction is a way to prevent self-harm once you feel the urge or stop self-harming once recognize you are self-harming. It is important to figure out what kinds of distractions work for you in each situation. Sometimes the trigger or urge is different depending on the feeling or situation, meaning that our response to prevent or stop harm is different too.[3]\n\nColor your hair.\nMake a cup of tea.\nCount up to 500 or 1000.\nWork on a puzzle or mind game.\nGo \"people watching.\"\nPlay a musical instrument.\nWatch TV or a movie.\nPaint your nails.\nOrganize something like books, your closet, etc.\nMake origami to occupy your hands.\nPlay a sport.\nTake a walk.\nMake your own dance routine.\nDo an art project or color in a picture.",
                "Wait it out. Delaying self-harm once you feel the urge is another way to break the self-harm cycle. Start with waiting just 10 minutes. See if the urge passes. If you still feel the urge to self-harm, wait another 10 minutes.",
                "Give yourself reminders about your actions. If you are faced with the urge to self-harm, talk to yourself. Give yourself reminders about the choices that you have.\n\n\nTell yourself that you don’t want scars.\nRemember that you don’t have to hurt yourself just because you're thinking about self-harm.\nRepeat to yourself, “I don’t deserve to be hurt,” even if you don’t believe it.\nRemember that you always have the choice not to cut. It’s up to you what you do.",
                "Remove self-harming tools from your house. Remove anything you use to self-harm from your house. Knives, lighters, and whatever else you use – even the hidden things – need to be thrown out.\n\n\nJust throwing stuff in the garbage might not be enough. Make sure you do not have access to them even in the trash can. Give it up to someone else to dispose of them for good.\nYou could even have a symbolic \"funeral\" for your harmful objects, burning them, throwing them away, or burying them. Say out loud: \"I don't need you anymore.\"",
                "Understand different forms of self-harm. There are many forms of self-harm. Self-harm can vary from physically harming yourself (cutting) to placing yourself in risky or dangerous situations (driving under the influence of substances), or neglecting your own needs (not taking prescribed medication).\n\n\nSelf-harm can be with or without intent of suicide.[4]\n\nAdditionally, self-harm might be a symptom of another issue such as depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder.[5]",
                "Understand that self-harm is an addictive behavior. The act of self-harm has been found to be an addictive behavior. When you or someone you know self-harms, it releases the “feel-good” chemical in the brain called endorphins.[6], [7] It is hard to change the cycle of self-harm especially while trying to find an alternative that releases the same “feel good” chemical. It might take some trial and error to find the right solution or combination of solutions that work for you.",
                "Discover your reasons for self-harm. The reason you or a loved one might self-harm varies depending on the person. Common reasons include gaining a sense of relief from intense feelings such as anger, guilt, anxiety, isolation, grief, or hopelessness. It can also be seen as an expression of those feelings. Other reasons include control over one's body especially when one feels out of control. Some people self-harm to feel something when feeling numb, and some reasons include a response to trauma or other issues like anxiety and depression.[8]\n\nIdentifying triggers is one of the first steps for healing yourself. If the underlying triggers and causes are not addressed, the need for coping will remain.[9]",
                "Acknowledge your thoughts. To understand the thought patterns that lead you to self-harm, you first need to acknowledge your thoughts. Your thought process is a habit that you have. To break the habit of thinking negative thoughts, you need to become aware of these thoughts.",
                "Write in a journal. One tool to help understand your triggers and thought patterns is journaling. Writing down your feelings will help identify patterns that lead to self-harm. Also, journaling provides an outlet to share your feelings and process your thoughts.\n\n\nWrite down when you feel the urge to self-harm, or when you actually do harm yourself. Try to write down the situation, thought, feeling or emotion that you experienced. You may have also experienced physical sensations such as energy, tightening of the stomach, or other actions. Write down what happened just before the self-harming.\nJournaling might reveal that you are experiencing certain situations that create the urge to self-harm. Some of these situations might be: problems with peers (including bullying or cyber-bullying), pressure at school, feeling socially isolated, abuse, confusion around sexuality, or issues in your family.[10]\n\nThe goal is to become aware of your thoughts and not passively acting on negative thoughts that lead to self-harming behaviors.[11]",
                "Assess your thought process. The next step in combating negative thinking is to assess your thought process. Are your thoughts true? Look at your thought record and assess what similar situation you were in, did you learn anything and what were the long-term consequences? Did you handle any situations differently? [12]\n\nA good way to assess negative thoughts is to look for words like “should,” “ought,” or “must.” These types of statements are usually negative and critical of yourself.\nAsk a friend or trusted family member if you are unsure if thoughts are true.",
                "Interrupt your negative thoughts. Another technique is to interrupt your negative thoughts. Imagine a stop light or noise that stops the thought. Your goals here are to interrupt the negative thought and to remind yourself of your thought patterns. Then, you will experience a sense of control and a sense of awareness to the pattern of thoughts.\n\n\nThought stopping can be a physical change, such as doing an activity. Take a walk, talk with a friend, read a book, or work on a chore.[13]",
                "Replace negative thoughts with positive ones. When you have negative thoughts, you need to counteract these with positive statements. Look through your thoughts journal and write down alternative, positive statements.[14]\n\nFor example, if you think, “I always ruin dinner parties because I arrive too late,” you can counter this thought with something positive, such as: “I am a caring person because I like to bring some flowers for the host.”",
                "Use a cognitive behavioral therapy thought record worksheet. This type of worksheet takes you through various steps to acknowledge negative thinking and understand how to replace them with positive thoughts.\n\n\nA thought record reminds you about questions to ask yourself about your thought process, including describing the situation, identifying what you’re reacting to, looking at the situation from an outside perspective, assessing whether the statement or situation is true, and how you can respond to the situation.[15]\n\nThere are many cognitive behavioral therapy thought record templates available online, including here and here.",
                "Try positive self-talk. Positive self-talk refers to your inner voice and the way that you talk to yourself. This inner voice impacts your motivation, outlook, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Positive self-talk is a way to talk to yourself to gain confidence, build a healthier lifestyle and reduce negative thoughts.[16] Examples of positive self-talk include:\n\n\nI am lovable.\nI am special.\nI am confident.\nI can achieve my goals.\nI am beautiful.\nHarming myself does not solve my problems.\nI can overcome my anger, sadness, and anxiety without harming.\nI can trust someone with my feelings right now.\nI can seek support.\nRemind yourself by using post-it notes or leaving messages on your mirror.\nIf you have trouble believing abstract statements such as “I am special” or “I am confident,” you don’t have to use them just yet. Instead, use positive statements that focus on the behavior you want to achieve. These might give you more specific guidance, such as “I can trust someone with my feelings right now,” and “Harming myself does not solve my problems.”\nPositive self-talk should not be mandated by others. Instead, it should be used when you feel like it is helpful.[17]",
                "Create a coping skill box. A coping skills box or kit is a container that you fill with supplies to help stop the urge to self-harm.[18] These supplies will remind you of what you have. They may also help you redirect your energy into something positive, such as creating art. Some supplies for this box might include:\n\n\nPictures of friends, family, or pets\nJournal\nArt supplies\nInspiring quotes\nMusic or lyrics",
                "Talk to trusted loved ones. You don't have to wait until you feel an urge to talk. Share the ups and downs with your close friends and relatives. Surround yourself with their support. When you feel the urge to self-harm, the best thing you can do is tell someone you feel that way.\n\n\nIt is hard to verbalize our feelings and sometimes it is easier to act out our feelings of sadness, anger, or lonely in the form of self-harm. But for long-term success, it is important to address the underlying stress.[19]\n\nIf you self-harm, it might be embarrassing and hard to talk about. You might worry that the other person will judge you or pressure you to talk about it. But it is important to share your worries about your life with your loved ones. They want to help you.",
                "Write a note. If you are struggling with expressing yourself verbally, write a note or text to a friend or family member. This might help you communicate your thoughts without saying them out loud.",
                "Try the five senses technique as a self-soothing practice. Part of the recovery process is learning new skills to help release feel-good chemicals in your brain that you may experience when you self-harm. Self-soothing techniques are a way to take care of yourself and focus on the here and now. The benefit of the five senses technique is to provide a way to get in a state of mind that allows you to address painful or extreme feelings leading to self-harm.[20], [21]\n\nStart in a comfortable position. You can sit on the floor with legs crossed, or in a chair with your feet planted flat on the ground.\nStart to become aware of your breath. Focus on each part of your breath (inhale, hold, and exhale). You do not need to breathe in any particular way.\nNext, start to bring awareness to each of your 5 senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch).\nSpend about one minute focusing on only one sense:\nHear: What sounds do you hear around you? Focus on external sounds (do you hear cars going by, people talking, birds chirping?). Focus on internal sounds (can you hear your breathing or digestion?). As you focus on hearing, did you notice anything you did not before?\nSmell: What do you smell? Is there food near you? You might notice smells you did not before, like the smell of paper in the books. Try closing your eyes. Sometimes this helps decrease visual distractions and sharpen other senses.\nSight: What do you see? It is easy to see the couch or desk. Take notice of details such as colors, patterns, shapes and textures.\nTaste: What do you taste? Even if you do not have food in your mouth, you can still taste. Notice any aftertaste of a previous drink or meal. Run your tongue over your teeth and cheeks to help you become more aware.\nTouch: What do you feel without moving from your seated position? Feel the sensation of your skin being touched by clothing, seating in your chair, and feet on the floor. Feel the texture of your clothes or the chair.",
                "Try meditation or prayer. Meditating has shown to improve positive emotions, satisfaction, health and happiness. Also, it decreases anxiety, stress and depression.[22] There are many different types of mediation but the goal of all mediation is about calming the mind. The example below is a simple mediation to help start the process of calming one’s mind.\n\n\nStart in a comfortable seat position.\nHave a single point to focus on. This could be something visual such a candle flame, a sound such as a repeating single word or prayer, or something physical such as counting beads on a rosary. Keep your focus on this one thing.\nWhile you are focusing, your mind will wander. When you notice your thoughts wandering, let the thought go, and bring your concentration back to your focus point. This might sound easy, but focusing the mind is challenging. Don’t be disappointed if you can only focus for a few minutes at first.[23]",
                "Try breathing exercises. Breathing is a natural response that we can control. Research shows that practicing breathing has a positive impact on our stress response or “fight or flight” response. [24] The same stress response can be triggered when we feel the need to self-harm. Learning this skill can help us take control of our triggers. Try this breathing exercise:\n\n\nCount to 5 while inhaling, hold for 5 counts, and take 5 counts to exhale.\nFocus on each part of your breath as you count.\nAnother way to focus on your breath is to use a deflated balloon. Blow up the balloon and watch it deflate.",
                "Use visual imagery to create an imaginary “safe place.” Imagery refers to a picture in your mind. The image is peaceful or reminds you of a happy memory. Sometimes it is easier to have the picture printed out. Then you can focus on it. [25]",
                "Try progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a type of coping skill that focuses on tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. The benefit of progressive muscle relaxation includes helping you become more aware of physical sensations in your body.\n\n\nStart in a comfortable position that allows you to focus on different muscle groups. Most people find sitting or lying down the easiest to start.\nFocus on one group of muscles that you can tense and then relax. Common areas include face, hands and arms, stomach/ middle section, and legs/feet.\nTo start with your face, imagine eating a lemon. Feel the tension in your lips, cheeks, jaw, forehead, and eyes when you bite into the lemon. Your face gets all wrinkled around your nose, yours eye close, and your lips pucker. Then focus on relaxing all those muscles. It might help to think about eating something sweet and how your face feels relaxed/calm when you are eating something you enjoy.[26]\n\nTo work on your shoulders and back, imagine that you are a cat. Think about how a cat arches its back and spreads its paws. Make your body copy the cat. Roll your shoulders up to your ears and arch your back. You can even get on your hands and knees to really arch your back. Then relax and go back to your normal sitting position.\nFor your middle, it might be easiest to lay on your back. Imagine a heavy ball sitting on your stomach. Take a really deep breath, and relax those muscles.\nTense and relax your feet. This can be done anywhere, even when wearing shoes. Curl your toes. Then stretch them out as wide as they can go. Relax your toes.",
                "Take a mindfulness walk. A mindful walk is mindfulness in movement. Benefits of a mindfulness walk include learning awareness in daily life. Additionally, sitting still and doing a “traditional” mediation might be hard for some people. Walking is more active form of meditation. You can also get the added health benefits of walking.[27]\n\nWhile walking, take notice of each step. How do your feet feel on ground? How do your feet feel in your shoes? Focus on your breath. Take notice of the environment: Stop and smell the roses, as the saying goes.[28]",
                "Get help if there is the risk of suicide. If you or someone you are thinking about suicide, get help immediately. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency response (911). The following are some signs to look for if you are concerned about a loved one:[29]\n\nTalking about wanting to die or to kill themselves.\nLooking for a way to kill themselves.\nMaking statements about being hopeless.\nTalking about having no reason to live.",
                "Seek professional help. A psychologist or counselor can help you understand difficult emotions and overcome trauma. This person has the education, training, and experience to help you overcome issues that are driving your behaviors.\n\n\nAsk your doctor for a referral to a counselor or psychologist who specializes in self-harm. Schedule an appointment to talk. If you have trouble being honest with a close friend or family member, you may find it freeing and comforting to share with someone who doesn't know you.\nIf you have some really difficult life situations, such as abuse or a traumatic incident, or your feelings are so overwhelming that they drive you to cut or harm yourself, the most productive place for you to express those feelings is in a safe, neutral, and nonjudgmental environment.",
                "Find a support group. Your community may have a self-injury support group. This group can be helpful in identifying, verbalizing and coping with feelings associated with self-harm.[30]\n\nLook on the S.A.F.E. Alternatives website for listings of support groups near you.",
                "Talk to your doctor about other conditions. Some people who self-harm may be experiencing other mental health issues, such as depression,[31], substance abuse, eating disorders,[32] schizophrenia, or personality disorders.[33], If you feel that you may have another disorder that is contributing to your self-harm, talk with your doctor or counselor.",
                "Be honest. Be truthful with your therapist about what you feel or what's been going on. Remember that he is there to help you. If you aren't honest, you might not get the treatment you really need. It's important to tell the truth. Remember, therapy is confidential, so anything you say to your therapist will not be repeated unless you are planning to hurt yourself or another.",
                "Celebrate milestones. With an addiction, it's important to take the time to celebrate your achievements. Each day you go without harming yourself should be celebrated as a victory. At the end of your first week, celebrate by treating yourself to something or going out with friends.\n\n\nStart extending the length of your milestones, celebrating at first with days, and then weeks, months, and years. You may struggle with these thoughts for a while, but celebrating your milestones can help celebrate your efforts, looking forward and looking back.",
                "Believe in yourself. In the end, it's up to you: If you think positive and have faith in yourself, your addiction will become a distant memory that may have left you with a few scars. Once you stop self-harming, you'll feel and think much more clearly and honestly about the world, and about yourself. Believe that others care about you, and care about yourself. You can stop.",
                "Understand that relapses might happen. Sometimes you will start to think about self-harm or actually harm yourself. This is called a relapse. You can't beat yourself up over this; everyone relapses at one point or another. Remember that self-harm is an addiction, and relapses often happen during recovery. There may be times where you can't help yourself, but that only means you must continue to work hard. Just because you take one step back doesn't mean you can't take three steps forward next."

        "How to Cook Leeks": {
            "intro": "Leeks are cousins to the old, familiar onion, but leeks have a sweeter, more delicate flavor reminiscent of garlic or chives and are delicious no matter how they're cooked. Additionally, leeks contain generous amounts of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, making the vegetable a wise addition to a healthy diet. You can cook leeks by poaching them in chicken broth, pan-frying them in a little oil, or boiling them until tender, or you can include the leeks in a variety of other recipes.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose the freshest leeks. When you're shopping at your local farmer's market or in the produce aisle of your grocery store, you should look for leeks that are firm, white, and unblemished, with tops that are evenly green, without any bruises or blemishes. Purchase only as many leeks as you need, because leeks will keep in the refrigerator for only a few days.[1]\n\nLeeks with a diameter of 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) or less will be more tender, and larger leeks tend to be tough.\nChoose leeks of similar sizes to ensure even cooking.",
                "Cut the leeks. To cut the leeks, cut the roots from the bottom of the leeks and then remove the leafy tops where the firm, white part of the leeks starts to turn green.",
                "Thoroughly rinse the leeks under cool, running water. Separate the sections of the leeks as you're rinsing them to wash off any dirt that is trapped in the leeks.[2]",
                "Heat 3 tbsp. of chicken broth in a skillet. Heat the broth for 1-2 minutes until it steams.",
                "Place 1 lb. of chopped leaks in the hot broth and simmer them for 4 more minutes. After 4 minutes, add 2 more tbsp. of chicken broth. Then, cook the leeks for 3 more minutes, stirring frequently so they absorb the flavor of the broth.",
                "Drain the excess broth and toss the leeks with olive oil and lemon juice. Once the broth is drained, toss the leeks with 3 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. of lemon juice. Season the leeks with salt and pepper to taste.",
                "Serve. Eat the tasty poached leeks on their own, or add them to soups, stews, quiches, omelets, or scalloped potatoes. The leeks can also be cooled and then chopped further and added to salads.",
                "Heat 1 tbsp. of butter in a skillet. This should take about 30 seconds. As you're heating the oil, you can separate the leaves of the leeks so they'll cook more easily. Add 3 tbsp. of minced ginger and 1/2 minced garlic clove to the oil.[3]",
                "Place the sliced leeks in the hot oil and fry them. Fry the leeks, stirring frequently, until they become crispy and golden brown. Alternatively, place a lid on the pan and the leeks will cook without browning. Use only small leeks for frying, as frying can make larger leeks tough. Leeks can also be stir-fried with ginger and garlic, or incorporated into your favorite stir-fry recipes.",
                "Serve. Enjoy the fried leeks on their own or serve them as a garnish on soups or garlic bread, or on top of steaks.",
                "Bring a medium-sized saucepan of water to a boil. Place 2 cups of water in the saucepan.[4]",
                "Add the salt. Add 1 tsp. of salt to the pot. If you use more water, just add 1 tsp. of salt for every 2 cups of water.",
                "Add the leeks to the water and simmer them for 20-30 minutes. Cook them under medium-low heat until the leeks are tender when you pierce them with a fork. Then, remove the leeks from the heat and drain the water.",
                "Serve the leeks. Serve the boiled leeks with 2 tbsp. of melted butter and season them with salt and black pepper to taste along with 1 tbsp. of crushed red pepper. You can enjoy them on their own or on a slice of buttered toast.",
                "Make potato leek soup. Leeks, potatoes, and chicken broth are the main ingredients in this tasty soup.",
                "Make vegan leek quiche. Use soy milk and Brewer's yeast to substitute the traditional use of eggs in this healthy vegan dish. Just combine the leeks along with a few other ingredients, sauté them lightly, and then bake them in an oven.",
                "Make a leek vegetable sauté. Heat 2 tbsp. of olive oil on a pan and add 1/2 a clove of minced garlic after one minute. Let the garlic cook for 2-3 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced carrots and 1 bunch of diced turnips to the mixture. Cook them for another 3-4 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced leeks to the mixture. Cook the veggies until they're tender, for another 3-4 minutes, and then season them will salt and pepper to taste and serve them.",
                "Make pasta sauce with leeks. Heat 4 tbsp. of butter and 1 clove of minced garlic in a large skillet for 2 minutes and then add 4 diced tomatoes, 1 bunch of thinly diced leeks, 1/2 diced red onion, 1 tbsp. of pepper, 1 tbsp. of salt, and 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the pan. Continue to cook the ingredients for 5-7 minutes, until the leeks and tomatoes are tender and all of the ingredients are incorporated. Place the pasta sauce over whole wheat pasta and top it with 1/2 a cup of Jack cheese and 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.",
                "Serve the leeks with fish or fowl. Boil, fry, or poach the leeks and then serve them up with a simple baked salmon, broiled chicken, or tuna steak. Add mashed potatoes to this combination for a complete, healthy, and tasty meal."

        "wikiHow to Determine the Material Facts in a Case (Common Law)": {
            "intro": "Briefing cases is good practice for thinking like a lawyer, analyzing hypotheticals on exams, and arguing case precedent in your professional practice. When you brief a case, you are dissecting a judicial opinion and providing a summary of the basic components of that case.[1] One of the biggest challenges when briefing a case is parsing an overabundance of information for the most important details. When tasked with briefing case law, you will need to be able to identify the material facts of the case to understand and explain the court's ruling.",
            "steps": [
                "Read the opinion once. Before you brief a legal opinion you should read through the whole case once. This will help you understand the overall story and will give you an idea of what you will be looking for the next time around.\n\n\nWhen you read the case, pay attention to any facts and highlight them as you go.",
                "Create a heading. You will always start your case brief with a heading, which will include the case's identifying information. This information will make your brief easily identifiable and will help you incorporate a citation into a piece of work down the road. Everything you need for the heading can be found near the beginning of the judicial opinion.\n\n\nIn general, your heading will always include the:\n\nCase name;\nCourt name;\nDate of decision; and\nThe page number where the case appears in the applicable reporter.[2]\n\n\n\nTry and create a heading that conforms to a legal citation manual (e.g., the Bluebook or ALWD Manual). For example, you might try using a heading that looks like this: Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).\n\nWithin that citation is the case name, the court name, the date of decision, and the page numbers where it can be found.",
                "Explain the procedural history. The procedural history of a case is its disposition in lower courts.[3] For this section of your brief, you will want to explain how the case got to the court whose opinion you are now briefing.[4] Be sure you include the decisions of the lower courts (i.e., who won and why), the damages that were awarded, and who appealed and why.[5] The procedural history can usually be found near the beginning of a judicial opinion when the judge discusses the facts and issues of the case.\n\n\nFor example, if you are explaining the procedural history of Roe v. Wade, you might state that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled the Texas abortion statute unconstitutional and there was a direct appeal by Texas to the United States Supreme Court.",
                "Identify the issues of the case. When you identify the issue of a case, you will need to include a statement of the point of law in dispute.[6] This statement should be in the form of a question. The issue of a case is often stated explicitly by the court writing the opinion, but sometimes you may have to tease the issue out.[7]\n\nFor example, the issue in Roe v. Wade might be stated like this: Does the Texas abortion statute violate the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution?[8]",
                "Include the court's holding. The holding of a case is a statement of law that directly answers the question posed in the issue.[9] This is the majority's basic answer to the legal question and should include the vote count if there is one.\n\n\nFor example, the holding of Roe v. Wade is: (Vote: 7-2) Yes: The Texas statute is unconstitutional because the Constitution and the Ninth Amendment recognizes the right to an abortion.[10]",
                "Ascertain the rule of law. This is the rule the court applies to determine the holding of the case.[11] The rule could come from a statute, judicial opinion, or regulation.[12] While the rule may be explicitly stated in the opinion, it may also be implied.[13]\n\nIn Roe v. Wade, the rule of law is the test used to reach the holding, which was that the Texas statute was unconstitutional. In that case, the rule of law was announced that during the first trimester of pregnancy, most abortion regulations would be invalid.[14] During the second trimester of pregnancy, some regulations may be okay.[15] During the third trimester, abortions can be outlawed.[16]",
                "Describe the court's reasoning. The reasoning is how the court applies the rule to a particular set of facts.[17] This section is extremely important when you are trying to identify the material facts of a case. If you can correctly identify a court's reasoning, you will be able to quickly find the important facts as well.\n\n\nWithin the reasoning, a court will explain the particular facts of the case that lead them to use the law they did and to decide the outcome the way they did.\nFor example, in Roe v. Wade, the court reasoned that a woman has a privacy right, as well as an interest in avoiding physical and psychological harm, and therefore abortions cannot be outright denied.[18] The court further stated that while the state of Texas had legitimate interests in banning abortions, those interests had to be balanced with the interests and rights of the female.[19] As a pregnancy progresses, the interests of the state become stronger.[20]\nThis reasoning gives you clues to what some material facts might be. For example, the fact that Texas' abortion law was an absolute prohibition is material. This is the case because the court concludes that while Texas has interests, they have to be balanced. Put a different way, if Texas' law would have allowed abortions in some circumstances, perhaps the case would have turned out differently.",
                "Understand what a material fact is. A \"material fact\" is a fact that is crucial to the determination of an issue at hand.[21] Without this particular fact, the court's determination of the issue would have been different.\n\n\nMaterial facts can also be thought of as those facts which a party would use to prove his or her case.[22]\n\nThink about who the parties are, what their dispute is, and how they got to where they are.[23]",
                "Keep in mind the particular subject you are concerned with. Case briefing helps you put cases in context.[24] However, cases are rarely only about a single issue. The court's opinion may cover more issues than are relevant to the subject upon which you are focused. This additional information can distract you from the purpose of your assignment.\n\n\nFor example, if you are briefing a case for your contracts course about an office lottery pool, you will want to focus on what the court says about the agreement between the parties, and pay less attention to what the court says about the tax consequences to the lottery winners.",
                "Read the facts of the case. The court's opinion usually has a recitation of the facts near the beginning. This section tells the story prior to the presentation of the analysis of the facts and applicable law. Although you cannot be certain which facts the court considered material until you have finished reading, highlight or take note of the facts that seem most important to you as you read.",
                "Determine how each fact fits in. To do this, look through the case and determine how each fact affects the holding and reasoning of the opinion. If a particular fact affects the holding or reasoning, then it should be considered material. If, on the other hand, a fact does not have any bearing on the holding or reasoning, you can safely assume it is not a material fact.\n\n\nYou should brief your entire case before determining the material facts for this reason. If you know the holding and the reasoning, you will be able to better analyze the facts.\nIn general, if a fact is brought up in the reasoning of a case, it is likely going to be a material fact.\nFor example, in Roe v. Wade, ask yourself how the fact that the Texas statute outlawed all abortions affects the holding and reasoning of the case.",
                "Identify the material facts. For each factual detail, ask yourself, \"If this fact were changed, would the outcome of the case be different?\" This helps you separate the material facts from immaterial background information and explain why the court reached the conclusion that it did.\n\n\nExample A: The plaintiff emailed a contract to the defendant. The plaintiff and defendant disagree on specific terms of the contract. Thus, the method of sending the contract is not a material fact, because the method of transmission does not affect the court's interpretation of the terms of the contract.\nExample B: The plaintiff emailed a contract to the defendant. The defendant refuses to perform because the contract did not arrive in time. Plaintiff sues for nonperformance. Now the method of sending the contract is a material fact, because the details of the method of transmission, whether by email, postal service, etc., is necessary for the court determine whether the contract arrived in time.",
                "Create a statement of facts to include in your brief. When you include your statement of facts in your case brief, identify the parties and their relationship and identify the material facts of the case.[25] Try writing the statement of facts in chronological order so as to create a mini story of the important pieces of the case."

        "wikiHow to Floss With Braces": {
            "intro": "As any orthodontist will tell you, while flossing can be difficult when you have traditional metal braces, it's more important than ever to keep the gaps in your teeth clean when you have these devices. Luckily, whether you're working with good-old fashioned floss and your bare hands or any one of a number of helpful flossing tools, getting your teeth and braces squeaky-clean is a cinch once you get the hang of it.",
            "steps": [
                "Use waxed floss if possible. When you're flossing with braces, it's important to remember that there are plenty of metal pieces and corners to catch your floss on. Because of this, you'll want to use a thin, wax-coated floss whenever you can. Unwaxed, thread-like floss is much more likely to get stuck to your braces.[1]\n\nThe amount of floss you should use can vary slightly based on the size of your mouth and your hands. Most dental resources recommend a piece about 12 – 18 inches (30 – 46 cm) long.[2]",
                "Thread the floss behind the brace wire. Grab the floss with one hand a few inches behind one end. Carefully thread it under or over the main wire of your braces, taking care not to get it stuck. When it's around the wire, pull it through so there's enough slack on either end to grab it.[3] A mirror can be a big help here.\n\n\nBe gentle. Do not pull on the brace wire with the floss — you're just trying to get the floss behind it, not to \"scrub\" at the wire itself.",
                "Push the floss between your teeth. Grab one end of the floss in each hand. Wrap the ends around your index fingers for a tight grip. Adjust the floss so that it runs up the bottom of each index finger to the fingertip. Move one index finger inside your mouth and gently pull the floss so that it goes into the space between your teeth.\n\n\nIf you've flossed before, this movement should feel natural. You basically want to move the floss into the \"crease\" between the teeth, then push it down into the gap. For some of your teeth, this will probably be a tight fit — this is normal.",
                "Slide the floss up and down. Now that the floss is in between your teeth, use your fingers to slide it up and down from the gums to the point where it's difficult to keep moving it. Pull gently so that the floss rubs against the insides of both teeth. You want to \"scrub\" as much of this inner space as possible — try doing it five times against each surface.\n\n\nThis scrubbing motion may seem like it's not \"doing\" anything, but it is. Flossing isn't just for removing bits of food that get stuck — it's also important for removing plaque, an invisible film of bacteria that can cause decay, pain, and discoloration if it's not dealt with.[4]",
                "Carefully pull the floss out. Grab one end of the floss and gently pull until it comes free, taking care not to catch it on your braces. Congratulations — you've just flossed between one set of teeth!",
                "Repeat for each tooth until finished. Go down each row of teeth and carefully thread the floss between every set of teeth all the way to your furthest-back molars. When you have \"scrubbed\" with every set of teeth on the top and bottom of your mouth, you're done.[5]\n\nTake your time. Flossing properly when you have braces can take up to three times longer than a normal flossing session, but it's especially important to floss when you're wearing orthodontic devices because these devices can get in the way of cleaning with a brush alone.[6]\n\nYou may also experience some gum bleeding which is normal due to inflammation which occurs when braces are placed in.",
                "Try using a floss threader. Sick of painstakingly flossing with your bare hands? A helpful tool called a floss threader can make it easier to get the floss behind your braces. The threader looks similar to a small plastic needle, and it can be used to floss.[7]",
                "Thread a piece of floss into the eye of the threader. It’s the same way you would thread a sewing needle. Insert the plastic needle under the archwire of your braces and pull the floss through.[8]",
                "Use the floss as you normally would. Now that it’s in position, grab the floss in your hands and floss down between the teeth. Pull the floss out and repeat with the same threader. The threader is useful for making it easier to get the floss into the correct position without scraping up your fingers.\n\n\nBe careful when you apply the pressure to get in between your teeth — go gently with a back and forth movement.",
                "Purchase a water flosser. Many dentists and orthodontists today recommend a special tool called a water flosser (or \"oral irrigator\") to help with flossing. Water flossers are available online, in specialty stores, and even at dentist's office for about $50 and up (brands include WaterPik).",
                "Fill the reservoir with water. There is an indicator line to show where the water should reach. Be sure to clean the reservoir regularly — you don’t want bacteria to breed.\n\n\nAdd also mouthwash to the water to increase the antibacterial protection and prevent gingivitis.",
                "Use the water flosser. This tool shoots a narrow stream of water which can be used to remove particles of food and clean between teeth, though dentists don't usually recommend them in place of flossing. They can be really helpful as a complement to flossing, flushing out some of the food that might be in particularly difficult-to-reach places. As an added benefit, water flossing can be used for gum stimulation, restoring proper health and function to gums that are inflamed or receded.",
                "Use dental tape. If normal flossing hurts, a smooth and sometimes spongy dental tape might not. Dental tape is a special type of floss that's especially thin and wide — almost like a small ribbon. Dental tape is used in the same way as normal floss, but people who have painful teeth or gums often find it to be more comfortable.[9]",
                "Use a proxy brush. Proxy brushes are small, flexible, pointed brushes that have bristles that look similar to a pine tree. Their unique shape makes them perfect for cleaning behind braces — simply insert the brush under the wire and between the teeth, then scrub to clean. Proxy brushes aren't available everywhere, so talk to your dentist or orthodontist if you're interested in getting one.[10]\n\nYou can also use a bit of toothpaste on the proxy brush for a better cleaning.\nProxy brushes aren't intended to be used as a replacement for floss. They can't clean between the teeth as thoroughly as floss can. Instead, they're used along with floss to ensure that the area behind the braces receives enough cleaning.",
                "Use an orthodontic brush. An orthodontic brush is a special type of toothbrush with V-shaped bristles. These special bristles help it clean behind braces and other orthodontic appliances, making them a big help when it comes to keeping your teeth clean.[11]\n\nAs with proxy brushes, orthodontic brushes are meant to be used with floss — not instead of it."

        "How to Grow Bacopa Plants": {
            "intro": "Bacopa (Sutera cordata, Bacopa hybrida) makes an attractive trailing or spreading garden plant with masses of small blue or white flowers (though the flowers can also appear in reds or pinks). It can grow as a perennial in zones 9 through 11 and grows as an annual in zones 7 through 9, where temperatures drop to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17.8 degrees Celsius).",
            "steps": [
                "Be aware that seed-grown Bacopa may grow smaller flowers. You can grow some varieties of Bacopa from seed. However, seed grown Bacopa plants generally offer smaller flowers than ones propagated by other methods.",
                "Start growing your seeds in late winter. Fill a container with moist compost. Sprinkle the seeds onto the compost; do not cover them with soil. Mist the seeds with a water spray. Put the container into a clear plastic bag and place it in a bright area out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that is not in full sun.\n\n\nThe seeds germinate quickly; you should see new growth within ten days.",
                "Remove the cover after the seeds germinate. Consider removing the weaker seedlings at this point in order to thin the plants out and preserve the stronger seedlings. Once big enough to handle, you can transfer the seedlings to individual pots.\n\n\nWait until all danger of frost has passed before planting the Bacopa seedlings outside.",
                "Encourage bushy growth. Some gardeners advise pinching off the growing tip once the Bacopa plants get to about four inches in height. This encourages bushy growth.",
                "Consider growing Trailing Bacopa from a cutting.Trailing varieties of Bacopa can be easily propagated from a cutting. To do this, in late summer cut about three inches of fresh healthy stem from a Bacopa plant using a clean sharp blade. Dip the cut end in rooting powder or hormone after you have made the cut.\n\n\nRemove the lower leaves on the stem, then insert an inch of cut stem into a pot containing cutting mix. You can buy special cutting compost, or make your own by mixing 50:50 vermiculite and sand.",
                "Help your cutting to grow. Water your cutting, then enclose it in a clear plastic bag. Keep the cutting out of direct sunlight but in a well-lit area, such as a window ledge that does not get direct sun. Make sure the cutting doesn’t dry out; mist the cutting with a spray bottle if necessary.\n\n\nThe cuttings should root after about five weeks. You can then transfer the cuttings to individual pots.",
                "Harden off your cuttings before planting them outside in the spring. Hardening off means gradually adjusting the plants to life outdoors.\n\n\nTo do this, put them outside during the day and bring them in at night over a period of about two or three weeks.",
                "Pick out a planting site that has partial shade. Bacopa favors partial shade although it will survive in full sun. The plant grows best if it can avoid the full heat of the day so consider planting in an area that only gets morning or late afternoon sun.\n\n\nSome varieties, such as ‘Snowstorm’, can handle high temperatures better than other Bacopa varieties.\nYou can also plant Bacopa alongside taller plants to give them some shade during the hotter parts of the day.",
                "Plant the Bacopa in soil that drains well. Bacopa plants do not like wet feet. Because of this, your plant needs good drainage and a rich soil. The ideal soil for growing Bacopa is slightly acidic.",
                "Dig a hole for your Bacopa. Once you have selected a site for your plant, dig a hole for each individual Bacopa plant. The plants should be spaced roughly seven or eight inches apart. Place the plant in the hole and fill the rest of the hole with soil. Pat the soil down gently and give it a good watering to remove any air pockets.",
                "Encourage bushy growth by pinching back branches. Bacopa plants don’t need much attention once they are planted. However, you can pinch back the branches once they get to about four inches in length to encourage bushy growth. To do this:\n\n\nUse your fingertips to remove the tips of the growing shoots by about a third of an inch.",
                "Consider planting your Bacopa in a container. Trailing Bacopa grow well in hanging baskets. If you plant to cultivate Trailing Bacopa, consider planting it in a hanging basket or container. Add a peat-based potting mix to the container. Include some vermiculite or other water-retaining soil additive. Make sure the container has good drainage.\n\n\nPlant your Bacopa in the center of the basket. Feed your plant a weak solution of water soluble fertilizer once every fortnight.",
                "Do not allow your Bacopa plants to dry out. Bacopa plants have a little quirk: they lose flowers and foliage if allowed to dry out. If your Bacopa plant gets very dry it will cease flowering for a few weeks. Try to prevent this from happening, keep the soil well-watered.\n\n\nAvoid mulching as this may cause your low growing Bacopa to rot.\nYou may find it easier to grow the plants in containers so you can more easily control moisture levels. Make sure the container drains well.",
                "Feed your plant with a liquid fertilizer. Try to feed your Bacopa once every three weeks during the growing season to promote flowering. You should see flowers appearing from mid to late spring, and lasting through until summer.\n\n\nAvoid watering seedlings with a water-soluble fertilizer that you spray from above, as this can ‘burn’ them.",
                "Protect your Bacopa against aphids. You can combat aphids by spraying bug spray on your plants, or by hosing the aphids off with water. However, be careful not to damage your Bacopa by spraying them with a hose.",
                "Prune your Bacopa. If your Bacopa gets very woody in the lower branches by mid summer, or is producing fewer flowers, try cutting the plant back by about a third. Feed and water after doing this to help the plant to start thriving again. Old, woody growth will hold moisture and may rot.\n\n\nIf you are in zone 9 or above, cut your Bacopa plants back again in the fall. This encourages them to re-grow in the spring. In cooler zones, take cuttings in the fall then bring them inside the house to propagate over winter. Plant them outside again in the spring."

This dream is becoming a reality for many people, especially as the Internet makes it possible to work from anywhere and has increased our awareness of job opportunities abroad. There are two main types of jobs you can get to help you travel and work at the same time – travel-based jobs, meaning you have to travel to get to or to do the job; and travel freedom jobs, meaning you can do the job from anywhere. With a little effort and hard work you can get the kind of job that lets you travel and work at the same time.",
            "steps": [
                "Get a travel industry job. What skills do you have that you could use while traveling? Some employers have seasonal work that you may be able to train for or do easily. Research online and you will find travel-based jobs for every kind of skill.",
                "Become an adventure guide. Adventure outfitters and summer camps recruit guides in the off season. If you want to be a rafting guide in the USA, start looking for summer work in the autumn or winter.[1]\n\nSurf instructors in Costa Rica work during the winters.\nMake a travel plan and network with other guides who can provide job information.\nResorts need staff for every activity they offer, so find out things you can do at your skill level.",
                "Get a job as a nurse. Traveling nurses are in high demand. Many agencies will hire nurses from three months to a year to work at hospitals around the USA. Some even offer housing. Search online for traveling nursing positions and contact the recruiters. Most websites list location, pay rate, and benefits up front.[2]",
                "Become a travel professional. Airline pilots, flight attendants, cruise ship staff, and transportation employees such as truck drivers travel as part of their work. While some of these jobs don't allow for much time to explore tourist areas, travel professionals can find ways to get out and enjoy, too. Research the industry to see what kind of skills and training are required.[3]",
                "Try teaching English abroad. There are many opportunities to teach English abroad. Most places require that you take their Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) training class before you can sign on.[4] This may expensive, but once you have the TOEFL certification, you can teach in many countries. Agencies often help with job placement.[5][6]",
                "Get a service industry job. Many tourist destinations have resorts, theme parks, and restaurants looking for waiters, housekeepers, and attendants. The highest seasons for family tourist destinations are when children are not in school. For other places, high season may be during the best weather or centered around holidays. Check around for vacation high season in the area where you want to travel.[7]",
                "Get a freelance job. Many writers, photographers, web designers, and graphic designers can do their work from anywhere in the world as long as they have an Internet connection. There are online companies recruiting people with these types of skills. Be wary of anyone asking for money. There are plenty of legitimate companies hiring freelancers. Be prepared to bid for freelance work or possibly get paid a bit less than if you worked in the same job at an office.[8]",
                "Start working from home. Ask your current employer if you might be able to start working from home (if that’s possible for your type of work). If they say yes, then you may be able to start traveling and completing your work while you’re on the road. Most work-from-home jobs allow employees to complete the bulk of their work online or to submit their work from another location. You don’t have to stay home to work from home.[9]",
                "Figure out how to earn passive income. If you have web design and writing skills, you may start blogs or content-based websites that generate passive income through advertising and referral programs. This takes a bit of a time investment upfront, but once the site is established and active, it may generate returns. Start these sites while traveling or better yet, get them up and running before you go. Sites that are generating money will need maintenance and content updates once you are on the road.[10]\n\nAdvertisers usually make direct deposits into your bank account. Depending on your home country, there may be restrictions or limitations to getting paid, so be sure you have access to the money you earn before you begin your travels.",
                "Start your own business. Become a travel consultant, importer, or zip-line installer. Find a need for your specific services and skills, then market them in a way that makes sense for you and gives you the freedom you desire from your work.[11]\n\nFor example, engineers might start a business building zip-lines or obstacle courses for resorts around the world. Travel buffs can offer their services to corporations sending employees on international travel. If you love to shop, set up an importing business and next time you travel get inventory for resale.",
                "Get rid of the material excess in your life. This includes things that take up space and cost money. People who successfully work and travel are usually comfortable with living light rather than being loaded down with possessions. If you have an expensive car that requires expensive insurance, you will be required to always make money to pay for that car. Having less possessions means you have more freedom to make enough to live and travel as you like.[12]",
                "Downsize your home. Living in a large home was a huge part of the American Dream for so long, but now more and more people are realizing the benefits of inhabiting smaller spaces. The smaller the space is, the less room you have for excessive material possessions too, so it will aid you in the whole process of downsizing your life.[13]\n\nLiving in a smaller home means less maintenance for you, less stress about the upkeep of your home, and probably less money each month in rent or mortgage.",
                "Eliminate your debt. Having the freedom to travel because of learning to live with less often means getting rid of your financial ties to your current home location. It is much easier to travel freely when you don’t have a mortgage, credit card debt, or a car payment weighing you down and always pulling you back home.[14]\n\nTry to limit your spending on frivolous luxuries so that you can put some extra money toward your debt each month. This will help you pay it off sooner so you can have more freedom to travel.\nIf you plan on traveling for extended periods of time, it might even make sense to sell some of your possessions in order to pay your debts down. For example, if you wanted to move abroad for a while, you might sell your car (since you won’t be using it anyways) to help you get your debt to a manageable level.",
                "Change your expectations. We live in a consumer culture that is obsessed with always looking for the next big thing – the newest car, the biggest house, the nicest clothes, etc. If you maintain these kinds of expectations and desires for your life, it will be hard for you to be satisfied by living with less.[15]\n\nWork on realizing that happiness isn’t achieved through material possessions and that living with less might help you create a more sustainable, more enjoyable life.\nBut to make this work, you’ll need to let go of those old expectations."

At times, it may feel like you'll never be happy again — that this person was your one chance in life for feeling loved and now they're gone. Don't give into these thoughts. The truth is that with positivity, patience, and determination, you can always work your way out of the darkness of a romantic split.",

At this point, being reminded of your time together with this person can lead to intense feelings of nostalgia, sadness, and regret. For this reason, it's a good idea to get rid of things in your life that remind you of your relationship. If there are items you can't stand to throw away, try packing them into boxes and keeping them somewhere out of the way for the near future. Here are a few things you may want to look for:\n\n\nYour ex's possessions that s/he left with you\nGifts your ex gave you\nMusic or mixtapes that your ex made for you\nPictures, drawings, or artwork that reminds you of your ex",

Unless you are 100% certain that you can stay \"just friends\" with your ex, (and s/he is also 100% sure), avoid seeing your ex as much as you can for at least a month or two. When you are forced to see this person, keep your conversations as short and polite as possible. This may be hard, but it's important. Interacting can lead to awkward exchanges where both partners are thinking about the old relationship. You may even fall back into old ways with your ex and start flirting. In any case, this is almost never a good way to get over your split.\n\n\nToday, this advice applies to your technological connections as well. Seriously consider \"unfriending\" or blocking your ex on your social networks (at least for the time being).

Being around people you're close to makes it easier to keep things in perspective. Your friends and family will offer you helpful advice (which you should listen to) and be there to comfort and reassure you when you're not feeling good. Remember — nothing ever got better because people didn't talk about it.\n\n\nIf you're away from your support network, make the best of your situation. Phone calls and Skype chats can be very helpful. You can even make new friends, but don't get into a new relationship yet.",
                "Always value yourself. Remember that you are the most important person in your life. Keeping this in mind will make it easier to focus on your self instead of on your lost partner. Be confident in your many positive traits and accept your flaws — everyone has them. Focus on being the best person you can be. Happiness comes not from other people but from within yourself.\n\n\nIf it helps, you can even try thinking of your ex with pity. Losing you is something your ex will regret once s/he realizes how valuable you actually are.",
                "Accept that you loved this person but that this is in the past. Love can be perfectly real without being forever. You can love someone else deeply for a time but have that love come to an end. Just because it ended doesn't mean it was a waste of time. Your love touched you at your core and shaped who you are as a person. In the words of the old cliché, it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\n\n\nA large part of this acceptance is forgiveness. Forgive yourself for not being able to hold it together. Forgive your partner for wanting to leave (if you are going to remain friends with them later on this one is absolutely vital). Forgive your partner or yourself for the problems that led to the split. You are both only human.",
                "Get active and organized. Once you've taken some time to recover from your heartbreak, hit the ground running. Use your new independence as an opportunity to focus on improving your life. Now is your chance to earn successes that will make you feel good about yourself and leave you in a better position than you were before. Just a few examples are below:\n\n\nDevote yourself to your work. Accept ambitious new assignments. Take more responsibility. Ask for a raise or a promotion.\nTake up a new hobby. Learn how to play an instrument. Study a new language. Start writing stories or keep a journal.\nExplore the world. Travel. Meet new people. Trek out into the wilderness (with proper safety precautions).",
                "Open yourself up to new relationships. After a difficult breakup, it's usually best to swear off romance for a month or two to avoid the emotional problems that can often come with \"rebound\" flings. However, once you've taken some time off, it's okay to look at, talk to, and like someone new. Doing this may feel a little painful or awkward at first. This is normal. You're essentially going through a kind of withdrawal from the person that you constantly talked to and saw before. This will fade with time.\n\n\nWhen someone new comes along, let this person in. Don't be so afraid of future heartbreak that you can't enjoy your life now. Even if it's a small crush, it's okay to feel something for someone new.",
                "Live in the present. No matter how badly you or your partner screwed up in the past, you can't change it. What's done is done. Coming to terms with this can be difficult — some people are deathly afraid of letting go. However, you can't truly move on with your life until you start thinking more about today than about when you were with the person you used to love.\n\n\nThis will take time, so be patient. You may not be able to keep yourself from thinking about your old love for a while. However, as long as you focus on yourself and don't allow yourself to give in to depression and pessimism, you will eventually start to let go.",
                "Look forward to the future. At one point, it may have seemed like you would never be happy again. As time passes, this idea will start to seem less and less reasonable. The fact is that you can always look forward to a brighter future. There are always new people to meet, new experiences to seek out, and bright new days to look forward to. Your happiness isn't determined by what happened in the past — it's determined by what you have in store for the future.",
                "Let your memories of this person gradually fade. Time heals all wounds. Right after your breakup, it may seem like you can't go a minute without thinking about how badly you miss your ex. Slowly, however, over the weeks and months, these thoughts will become less common. Eventually, you will go an entire day without thinking unhappy thoughts about your ex. You'll basically \"forget\" to be sad. When this happens, take it as a major accomplishment. You did it! The rest of your life awaits.\n\n\nThis isn't to say that you need to stop thinking about this person all together. You can hold memories of this person dear in your heart. However, they shouldn't be something that interferes with your life. They should be a source of gentle tenderness and nostalgia — like thoughts of a beloved relative who has long since passed away."

        "wikiHow to Tame Your Rabbit": {
            "intro": "Rabbits can be very aggressive creatures, which can be a shock when you were expecting a cute, cuddly pet. However, most rabbits can be tamed over time with patience and understanding. You just have to let your rabbit get to know you slowly and teach it to associate you with good things (cuddles and treats).",
            "steps": [
                "Be prepared. If you have a particularly vicious rabbit, you may need to take precautions at first. You might need to wear clothing or gloves to protect yourself from biting when you interact with the rabbit. You should be able to tell if you need to take this precaution. For instance, if every time you go near the rabbit, it tries to bite you, that's a good indication you need to protect yourself.[1]",
                "Greet it in its cage. Start by spending time with it near or in its cage, if it's big enough. Open the door, and sit near the opening if it's not big enough for you to get in. Let the bunny come up and sniff you. Letting it take its time will give it a chance to get to know you.[2]\n\nYou may even consider laying down, if the bunny is merely shy. If you loom above the bunny, it will likely see you as a predator.[3]\n\nHowever, you may not want to lay down if the bunny keeps lunging at you and trying to bite.",
                "Watch for visual cues. Sometimes, you need to follow the lead of the rabbit. Rabbits are like cats in that it's best to wait until the animal asks for attention. One way a rabbit may ask for attention is to lean against the side of the cage. If you notice this behavior, you can try to stroke the rabbit's head through the bars with your fingers, talking softly and sweetly to it as you approach.[4]",
                "Let it out around you. In a rabbit-proof room, let the rabbit out. Sit on the floor at the rabbit's level. Give it a chance to get curious about you. As the rabbit approaches you and sniffs, give the rabbit a treat. Every time the rabbit comes back to you, give it another treat. That way, the rabbit comes to associate you with good food.[5]\n\nYou only want to use treats the first couple of times. After that, switch to pellets you take out of its daily quantities.\nYou can also use veggies the rabbit likes. The rabbit should be eating leafy greens, so that's a good place to start, such as parsley, green or red leaf lettuce, beet greens (red Swiss chard), bok choy, mustard greens, or collard greens. You can also use small amounts of fruit, such as strawberries, pears, or oranges (no peels on the oranges).[6]\n\nTo rabbit-proof a room, all cords need to be hidden (such as in plastic tubing) or out of reach. You also need to remove any plants that are toxic to bunnies, which you can look up on sites like this one: http://rabbit.org/poisonous-plants/. For instance, some toxic plants include daffodils, irises, tomato leaves, and mistletoe. You may also need to block off areas the rabbit may want to chew, such as blocking baseboards with a board. You can also use a small, movable pet fence to create a safe area.[7]",
                "Pet from above. Once your rabbit gets to know you, try petting it when it approaches. The best way to do this is to place your hand above the back, not above or in front of the head.\n\nIf your hand is in front of the rabbit, it has a chance to leap forward and bite you.\nAvoid hovering your hand over the rabbit's head in a predator-like way. Hovering over the head may cause the rabbit to become fearful and/or stressed.",
                "Spend time each day with your rabbit. You can't tame your rabbit in a day. You also can't visit with your rabbit once a week and expect it to get tame. You must spend time each day petting your rabbit and letting it get to know you. In fact, you can increase the time you spend with it a little each day.",
                "Try picking it up. Once your rabbit is accustomed to you, trying picking it up. When picking it up, use a hand underneath the chest between the legs. Use the other hand to support its back end. Don't try to lift it by the back of the neck (the scruff), the legs, or the ears. You could seriously hurt your rabbit.[8]\n\nYour rabbit is likely to be scared by this approach because it is similar to being caught by a predator.\nRemember, some rabbits may never like being picked up, though of course it is necessary from time to time. You can use this hold for moving the rabbit short distances.\nFor longer distances, hold the bunny, stomach down, against your chest. Have one hand under its rump and one hand across its shoulders. Loop your thumb over a front leg to keep it from jumping over your shoulder and hurting itself.",
                "Remove the house for an hour or two. One way to encourage socialization is to remove the rabbit's smaller house from the cage. A shy rabbit will spend much of its time inside the house, so removing it forces it to come out and socialize with you. Remember, though, the house is where the rabbit feels safe, so be sure to put it back.[9]",
                "Get the rabbit spayed or neutered. Getting the rabbit spayed or neutered is an important part of taming a rabbit. Rabbits that are not spayed or neutered have hormones running through their body, which in turn can make them more aggressive. Take the rabbit to a vet that works with rabbits and other exotic pets.\n\n\nFor instance, a rabbit that circles you and tries to nip is saying she's wanting sex. By spaying her, you can cut down on this behavior.\nHowever, remember that this step will take time to take effect. Expect a month's wait after the rabbit is spayed or neutered for this step to really help.[10]",
                "Listen for purring. Just like a cat, a rabbit will purr when happy. This sound helps you understand when the rabbit is happy, so you can repeat behaviors the rabbit likes. Unlike a cat, a rabbit's purr is made with its teeth, so listen for the sound coming from the mouth.[11]",
                "Reward aggression with calmness. Striking back with aggression or even an angry tone when a rabbit is aggressive only makes it more aggressive. Instead, treat every advance with a happy tone, such as, \"Hi, I'm glad you've come to see me.\" You can still move your limbs out of the way, but with calmness and deliberateness.[12]",
                "Make a sound when the rabbit bites. While you need to stay calm, you can help your rabbit learn that biting hurts. If your rabbit nips, it's okay to make a sound like \"Ow!\" or even a high-pitched \"EEK!\" That cues the rabbit in to the fact that it's hurting you. In turn, you're encouraging the rabbit to stop the behavior, partially because you're startling it.[13]",
                "Watch for triggers. Every rabbit is going to have things it doesn't like. For instance, your rabbit may not like to see you mess with its litterbox. Alternatively, your rabbit may not like its paws touched. Another thing your rabbit may not like is having someone in its cage. Once you figure out what upsets your rabbit, you can take steps to minimize those triggers.",
                "Entice, don't force. Sometimes, your rabbit will let you know it doesn't want to come out of its cage by moving to the back. If you need the rabbit to come out of the cage, don't drag it out. Rather, open the cage and let it hop out in its own time. If it doesn't want to come out, consider offering a treat outside the cage. You can even put a treat in a carrier so the rabbit has something to hop into.[14]",
                "Use a clicker to train tame behaviors. Clicker training is when you use positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviors. The clicker is a small device that makes a clicking noise. You can find them at many pet stores, and they are often used in dog training. You reward good behaviors and click at the same time, so the rabbit comes to associate the clicking sound with happy things.[15]\n\nYou can also use a simple clicking pen for this sound.\nAssociate the clicker with good things. Give the rabbit food, and as the rabbit takes a bite, make the clicking noise. If it startles the rabbit, you can muffle it a bit. You can also sound the clicker first, then give the bunny a small treat.\nRepeat several times, training in small bits each day to get your bunny used to the clicker sound. You can test to see if your bunny understands by making the noise when the bunny is doing something else. If it turns towards you, looking for food, the rabbit understands.[16]",
                "Decide on desired behaviors. For instance, maybe you want the rabbit to come when you call it. Once you have the rabbit coming to the clicker, you can start working on its name. As you make the clicking sound, also call the rabbit's name. Reward the rabbit with food as it comes towards you.[17]\n\nPractice this step every day. After a few days, take out the clicking step to try just calling the rabbit's name.\nThe reason you start with clicking is it is a short, identifiable sound that's easy for the bunny to understand. Moving to the name will take a little time.",
                "Move towards touching. Once you get the rabbit to come to you on cue, you can work on petting and touching. Start by training the rabbit to touch its nose to your hand. After that, work towards petting the rabbit, rewarding with clicking and treats.[18]\n\nAs the rabbit approaches you, hold out your hand. If your rabbit comes up to sniff or touch your hand, reward the rabbit with a click and a treat. Move your hand around to different places, and then hold still so the rabbit can approach. Every time the rabbit comes close to or touches your hand, immediately click and deliver a treat.\nWhen your rabbit seems confident, start gently moving your hand over its head as it touches you. As you press towards the rabbit, click and give a treat. That way, it associates you touching it with food.\nOnce you pet its head with confidence, try touching other areas, such as its rump or paw. In fact, you can use head pets for a reward for touching other areas once your rabbit finds it enjoyable.\nIf your rabbit seems upset by the petting, move back to just getting it to touch your hand until the rabbit seems happy and confident again.",
                "Work when the rabbit is hungry. One way to encourage the training to go faster is to wait until it's dinnertime. Then, use the training session to feed it part of its dinner. That way, the rabbit will be more motivated to come over to the food because it's hungry.[19]"

        "How to Remove Deep Stains from Dishes": {
            "intro": "Over time, dishes may become deeply soiled by remnants of food or drink, and these stains can be difficult to remove by conventional washing alone. Depending on the depth of the stain, and the type of dish, different solvents may be used to dissolve the remaining ground-in foodstuffs, allowing them to be rinsed away.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash dishes thoroughly. Leftover foodstuffs can cover up stains, shielding them from your cleaning efforts. Rinse and dry the dishes before continuing.",
                "Spot-clean stained dishes using a baking soda paste. To remove deep stains from your dishes, you'll need to introduce a solvent to dissolve the stain so that it can be washed away. Baking soda is a popular and convenient option and is significantly less caustic than industrial solvents. Start with a tablespoon of baking soda, and add just enough water or white vinegar to make a sticky paste. Using a clean dish rag or scouring pad, scrub the stains vigorously with the solvent paste, then rinse.[1]\n\nLemon juice is another common household product which can function as a mild solvent, and is a good substitute for white vinegar.",
                "Use a soaking solution of baking soda and vinegar to remove deeper stains. If a baking soda paste has proven ineffective, you may need to allow the solvents more time to deeply penetrate any stains. In enough hot water to completely submerge your dish, dissolve roughly 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of baking soda and 1 tbsp of white vinegar per cup of water, then allow the stained dishes to soak in the solution for 1-2 hours.[2]",
                "Rinse the dishes, and evaluate any remaining stains. If the stains have faded somewhat, but not completely, you may repeat the baking soda and vinegar soak. If the soak has not been effective at removing the stains, you'll need to consider more heavy-duty solvent options.",
                "Try a more powerful solvent. If common household solvents have proven ineffective, you may need a more potent solvent to remove the stains on your dishes. Many brands and varieties are available. Whenever working with chemicals, be sure to follow any instructions on the product's package closely. Work in a well-ventilated area, and avoid exposure to any caustic chemicals by wearing rubber gloves. Rinse your dishes thoroughly after applying the solvent to ensure that none of it remains on the dish.\n\n\nNot all commercially available heavy-duty dish cleaners are appropriate for all types of dish. Read the packaging carefully, and familiarize yourself with your options before purchasing.",
                "Use care when bleaching ceramics. Chlorine bleach, or any product containing it, should not be used on ceramics or glazed china, as it may interact with, and ruin, the glaze. Oxygen bleach (usually used for laundry) can be used instead. Mix oxygen bleach powder in hot water, allow it to cool to room temperature, and allow your dishes to soak. This will remove most stains, even the crack-like \"crazing lines\" which may begin appearing as ceramics age.[3]\n\nA common alternative for removing stains on china is 20% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is available in most pharmacies. Simply apply the solution to the affected area of the dish, then wash and rinse thoroughly.",
                "Wash dishes thoroughly to ensure that no food remains on their surfaces. If washing in a washing machine, make sure the dishes are placed on the uppermost dishwasher rack to avoid exposing the plastic to high temperatures.[4] Rinse and dry before continuing.",
                "Set the dishes in strong sunlight for at least two hours. Sunlight has a bleaching effect on plastic, and a few hours of exposure can remove stains, and will help deodorize your plastic dishes. Leave your dishes stain side up in front of an open window, or in a suitable outdoor location where sunlight is plentiful. After a few hours, check to see if the stains have lifted.[5]",
                "Try applying a solution of baking soda and vinegar. Baking soda and vinegar are convenient options, and are effective at dissolving many common varieties of food stains. Either soak your plastic dishes in a solution of baking soda, vinegar and warm water (roughly 1 tbsp each of baking soda and vinegar for every cup of water) for 1-2 hours, or scrub the dish using a baking soda paste (made by combining a small amount of baking soda with just enough vinegar or water to make it sticky).[6]\n\nAlternately, you can use salt and lemon juice, instead of baking soda and vinegar, to create a scrubbing paste.\nAnother common household alternative to baking soda and vinegar is rubbing alcohol, which can be applied via soaking, or simply by scrubbing the alcohol into the affected area of the plastic dish.",
                "Try using an oxygenating agent, like denture cleaner or a fizzing antacid tablet. These products can be surprisingly effective at lifting stains out of plastic dishes, especially cups and bowls. Simply fill the cup or bowl with water and drop two denture cleaner or antacid tablets inside, and soak overnight before washing and rinsing.[7]",
                "Soak the dishes in a solution of chlorine bleach. Bleach is potent and somewhat hazardous, but is a good last-resort when other approaches have failed to remove stains. Carefully combine bleach and water at a ratio of roughly one part bleach per two parts water, then allow the plastic dishes to soak in the solution for 30 minutes, then thoroughly rinse the dishes. [8]\n\nBleach is a very caustic substance, and you should be sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from contact with it. Also make sure the space you are working in is well ventilated, so that the fumes produced by the bleach are safely dissipated.",
                "Avoid scratching or chipping your dishes. Breaks in the surface of a glass, china or ceramic dish will allow food and drink to enter, leading to deeper, more difficult-to-clean stains.",
                "Warm ceramic dishes before serving hot food. Sudden changes in heat can cause tiny fractures in the surface of ceramic dishes or china. You should avoid causing this by warming the dishes (for instance, by placing them near or on a warm oven) before serving hot food on them.[9]",
                "Wash dishes promptly. This will prevent any food or drink remaining on the surface of the dish from setting in. Coffee and tea cups are especially important to clean immediately, since stains from these beverages tend to set in more quickly, and be much harder to remove. If you intend to store leftovers for a while, put the food into a container or dish you don't mind staining before putting it in the fridge. [10]",
                "Wash dishes properly, using hot water. Washing and rinsing dishes in water that is too cold makes it more difficult to remove grease, or food particles from a dish during washing, potentially leading to staining. [11]",
                "Avoid water marks on glass dishes by using the correct amount of detergent. Using too much detergent in your automatic dishwasher can result in water marks. If your glasses frequently become water marked after washing, consider reducing the amount of detergent. If this doesn't work, consider trying a new detergent. [12]"

        "wikiHow to Be a Champion": {
            "intro": "Champions do so much more than win. Part attitude, part natural ability, and part hard work, living your life like a champion is possible in all walks of life, whether you're an athlete, academic, or air-traffic controller. You can learn to find the right kind of championship and define success for yourself, laying the groundwork with a training regimen, and how to be a good winner who carries yourself like a champ. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Identify your natural talents. Champions identify the gifts that they've been given and seek to develop them into expertise. Competitive skill, natural athletic ability, and other talents are the seed from which championships grow, but they need to be watered with intelligent focus and hard training. You can't hop straight into the NBA or get hired on as a CEO for a tech company without identifying your talents and training to improve them.",
                "Identify your limitations. An athlete who is not gifted with blazing speed can make up for it by increasing their agility, strength, jumping ability, or strategy, but it's important to be honest. If you're an intelligent soccer player, you won't develop an attachment for playing striker if your shot is inaccurate, but your defending skills are top-notch.",
                "Explore different fields of play. Explore lots of competitive and non-competitive fields to see where you might be great. Diversify your talents and find your expertise.\n\n\nMaybe you've idolized LeBron James since childhood and can't get it out of your head to be a professional basketball champion, just like him. If you can't shoot your way out of a cardboard box and stumble on your own feet when you try to shoot a lay-up, that might be hard. But maybe you're built like Dick Butkus, or you can do the quadratic formula in your head–maybe you were destined for greatness in some other field.\nPlay lots of different sports, even if you're worried you won't be good. If you love football, try out volleyball to develop hand-eye-coordination and see if your skills translate. If you love playing tennis, try out a team sport like soccer to see if you don't enjoy playing a role in a group of champions.",
                "Choose to master every skill. Approach every new field of play with the desire to be great at it, with the expectation you will master it. When you're learning how to cook, when you're learning how to drive a manual transmission vehicle, when you're learning to speak German, treat it like you're walking onto the field of competition and that you'll come out champion.",
                "Identify the gold ring. If you've narrowed in on a set of skills and natural abilities, what is your ultimate goal? What will make you a champion? What will make you satisfied? Set a goal in mind and start yourself in working toward it.\n\n\nBeing a champion is partly a list of achievements, but even more so a state of mind. Being a champion has to do with knowing–really knowing–that you're the best at what you do. Winning the National Book Award might be a great achievement, but does that really mean that writer is the best?\nBeing a champion student might mean getting your grades up to at least Bs–something that might've seemed impossible at one point. Maybe being a champion worker means that you show up early and stay late and can walk with the confidence that you're great at what you do. Find your championship and define the terms.",
                "Become a student of the game. A chess champion studies opening strategies and finds new and creative ways to defend them. A champion football player exhausts himself in the front yard doing bunny hops to improve his speed and agility, instead of playing Madden on Xbox. A champion chemist forgets to eat dinner because the new issue of Science is too compelling. A champion lives and breathes the field for which they have talent.\n\n\nStudy the competition and study your competitors. Professional athletes devote countless hours each week to studying film of their next week's opponents, dissecting the strategies the other team will employ, the techniques they'll use, and the abilities of the athletes. Businessmen at all levels make a point of studying the sales strategies and the product quality of their competitors as a way of improving their own.",
                "Find great teachers and learn as much as you can from them. For every Michael Jordan there is a Phil Jackson. For every Messi a Maradona. Champions need great coaches, teachers, and motivators to keep them succeeding at a high level. If you're going to be a champion, you'll need help along the way.\n\n\nAthletes should consult good exercise trainers and coaches, as well as good weightlifting trainers, fitness and rehab doctors, and often diet coaches to stay fit and healthy.\nLook for coaches that you can build a relationship with on a personal level to make your training as enjoyable as possible. If you look forward to sessions with your coach, you'll be a better and more receptive student.\nLearn to take negative feedback and motivate you to improve. If a coach tells you that you're doing drills like a grandmother, you could collapse and complain, or you could kick it into high gear. Even if you were working hard, is it such a bad thing to go faster? If you're a champion, you'll say no.",
                "Develop a strict training routine. If you want to be a champion–to be the absolute best at what you do–it's important to devote time to training for that championship each and every day. You need to actively work on building skills, studying the game, and making yourself the best. Train like a champion and you'll be a champion.\n\n\nFor athletes, it's important to give equal weight to studying strategy, building fundamentals, and playing the game to have fun and learn to get better in competition. More specific instructions can be found for specifics sports below:\n\nBasketball\nFootball\nSoccer\nTennis\nSwimming\nGolf\n\n\nFor other fields, it's important to devote time and active effort in improving your skills. Depending on your field, this could be drastically different, but some important ways to improve your mind and your interpersonal abilities. You can learn other essential skills of the champion, translatable to all fields, below:\n\nNetworking\nSelf-Promotion\nSelf-Esteem\nPublic Speaking\nBuilding Relationships",
                "Train your body and your mind. Champions should cultivate positive thinking, confidence, and intelligence in regard to their work. Make it a priority to not only be a physically talented specimen on the field, but to be a smart worker and a reliable strategies, whatever your skill-set.\n\n\nIf you're an athlete, read up on biographies and strategy guides about your sport. The Art of War by Sun Tzu, a military guide, is a popular reading choice among hyper-competitive athletes. Even when you're not working on improving your physical skills, work on your competitive edge.\nIf you're a champion of the mind, train your body as well. Exercise can help improve memory retention, energy, and overall health, making you a better version of yourself. If you spend all day working indoors, it's especially important to get out and get moving to keep your mind fit.",
                "Find ways to motivate yourself. Eventually, you'll hit a wall. All champions struggle to find good reasons to get up every day, sore the day before, and hit the weight room, or head back to the office. It's hard to be great day after day. That's what real champions–the best of the best–find ways to stay motivated and keep themselves one step ahead. It's an essential part of training to be a champion.[1]\n\nLots of champions are big fans of using motivational music to psych themselves up before big games, or even practice. Heavy music with a big beat tends to be popular among athletes, making metal, hip-hop, and dance music iPod staples. Get \"Seven Nation Army\" by the White Stripes going in your headphones and try not to hit the gym with energy and enthusiasm. It's impossible.\nMichael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players to ever play the game, used to tape newspaper articles and quotes from opposing players that said negative things about him in his locker. Every time he got ready for practice and games, he would look over the negativity to psych himself up and light his competitive fires. If opposing players hadn't said anything negative, he would make stuff up. That's how much of a champion he was.",
                "Discipline yourself and reward yourself. Champions make self-improvement a priority, and while they might work alongside coaches, trainers, and other teachers alone the way, are driven from within to succeed, not by the opinions of others. It's important to put a system of punishment and reward in place to get yourself to champion-status.\n\n\nPact and FitLife are recent innovations in exercise motivation. By entering your fitness regimen into the system, these exercise trackers will punish you by taking money out of your account if you fail to exercise according to your initial plan.\nChampions need to blow off steam more than just about anybody. Find a way to unwind after you work hard training, to keep your mind sharp and relaxed. Lots of athletes enjoy video games, music, and reading after a long day of training.",
                "Expect to win. Every time you step onto the field, whether it be the office or the playing field, you need to go in expecting that you're going to walk out having done your best and proven your worth as a champion. Visualize yourself winning and doing what will be necessary to be the best and believe that it will happen.\n\n\nEliminate mental distractions when you're competing. When you're on the field, it's not the time to worry about your partner at home, whether or not you're going to be able to score concert tickets this weekend, or where you're going to party after the game. Focus on what needs to happen to win.\nTo help with your confidence, you have to train effectively. When you're about to compete, it isn't the time to be wondering if you could have worked your reps in the gym better, or if you could have watched more tape of the opposing team. Train hard and you'll know that you're at your best.",
                "Leave it all on the field. When you compete, you need to compete like a champion, which means saving absolutely nothing of yourself in the tank. All your energy, all your heart, all your soul, all your competitive fire needs to explode from you during the course of the contest. You can't be left wondering if you could have chased down that shot along the baseline a little faster, or if you could have been a little more energetic in your presentation. A champion shouldn't have to wonder.[2]\n\nAll athletes and champions of the mind have to confront exhaustion at some point. Losers pack it in, close up the shop, and cash out. Champions dig deep and find a little bit more where it seems like there shouldn't be any. Work hard in your training regimen and you'll have enough endurance and stamina to see the competition through.",
                "Win gracefully and lose graciously. When the whistle blows and the game is over, an athlete can reveal the grace and humility of a champion, or the childish behavior of a loser, regardless of the outcome.\n\n\nIf you win, treat it like business as usual. It's ok to celebrate, but you should act as if you've been there before. It shouldn't be a big surprise if you expected to win in the first place. Compliment the opposition and give credit where credit is due.\nIf you lose, it's likely that you'll be feeling frustrated and annoyed. If you're dealing with a sore winner, too, it can make it a lot worse. Don't sling mud, make excuses, or throw a tantrum, though. Shake your head, take your licks, and look to the next contest. Learn from losses and use them to motivate yourself to improve.[3]",
                "Give credit where credit is due. We've all seen the gloating self-absorbed athlete bragging after making a game-winning play, forgetting the fact that teammates were there contributing the entire game. Winning champions share the credit and praise their fellow competitors, coaches, and teammates. Even if you're feeling particularly proud of what you accomplished on the field, find something to praise about others who competed. Staying humble and showing perspective is an absolutely essential part of being a great champion.\n\n\nWe all like to think of ourselves and self-starters who are responsible for our own success, but try to widen perspective to see the bigger picture. Your success as a champion is dependent upon your teachers, your parents, even the people working the concessions stand, or driving the bus you use to commute are contributing to your success. Don't forget that, big shot.",
                "Take responsibility for success and for failure. Before you compete, treat it like your responsibility to win. Take on the burden of success and decide that it will be your fault if you don't come through as the champion. Put yourself in a position to win. If you don't come through, put your name on it and stand up to the blow-back like a champion.\n\n\nOnly you can decide whether or not you're a success. It might be good enough for you to have made a personal best on the golf course, regardless of what Tiger Woods has to say about it.\nNever throw any of your teammates, coworkers, or fellow competitors \"under the bus.\" Don't call someone out for blameworthy activity, even if it's deserved. Doing so is classless, a sign of pettiness. Share in the blame, if something went wrong, and act like a champion.",
                "Celebrate wins, big and small. Treat every occasion as a chance to celebrate your achievement. Very competitive champions are competitive all the time. Michael Jordan was known for his ruthless games of playground pig, a kids' game. Rafael Nadal, when injured, picked up high-stakes competitive poker to keep up the competitive energy while recovering from surgery. Competing regularly is an important way to keep your competitive edge sharp. As a champion, take the time to Approach every game of checkers like the Super Bowl. Approach every day like a gift.\n\n\nTake the time to celebrate your victories. In an effort to appear stoic, some champions can go too far in the opposite direction, accepting their accolades with grim solemnity. Cut loose every now and then! You're a boss!",
                "Surround yourself with competitive winners. Champions want to align themselves with fellow champions. Don't waste your time hanging out with people who aren't willing to put in the effort and the investment into their own success. Spend time with the greats.\n\n\nStrive to be part of a \"power couple,\" a couple that supports each other in mutual success. Power couples are made up of two motivated and ambitious people. Think Jay-Z and Beyonce, or Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Power couples are made of champions.\ntry to befriend champions from different fields than your own. It might be too difficult to be best friends with the best-ever masseuse in your town, when you're second-best. Cormac McCarthy, mega-acclaimed author, claims to never associate with other writers, preferring the company of scientists.",
                "Be an optimist. Your mind and outlook have an incredible impact on your performance. All champions have positive, unstoppable attitudes that contribute to winning and staying on top. Think positively in all things and look for the best in the people around you. Seek to bring out that better quality in others and focus on the positives.\n\n\nIn golf, long slumps are called \"the yips,\" and have been clinically verified as a psycho-phsyical phenomenon related to receptive tasks, the sort of which are found in sports.[4] The effect of the mind on the ability of the body to produce is profound, making positivity an important quality to cultivate in champions.",
                "Find champion role models. It's important for champions to look up to winners and model themselves accordingly. How did Muhammad Ali train for big fights? How does Tom Brady like to spend his off-season? What did William Faulkner like to do for fun? Study the greats and learn everything you can about them to learn more about properly applying yourself toward your own championship.\n\n\nFind role models in your own field and role models in other fields to learn unexpected pearls of wisdom. Kanye West constantly compares himself to the innovative geniuses of history in interviews: Einstein, Henry Ford, and Mozart are names he constantly drops in comparison to himself, as inspirations.\nAn old Buddhist saying: When you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha. Champions want to conquer their heroes. If you really look up to your track coach, who has had the state record for 25 years, make it your goal to best it. Keep working until you do.",
                "Find the next gold ring. As you climb the ladder and continue collecting championships, try to diversify your palate of competitions. What else are you great at? Where's the next challenge? A champion constantly seeks competition in all things.\n\n\nJay-Z, Dr. Dre, and Russell Simmons are all hip-hop impresarios who've cultivated multi-million dollar business empires, though they started by just wanting to be the best MCs. Now, the impact of their various businesses on style, culture, and music is enormous. They've become champions' champions."

This simple step-by-step guide will show you how to start a club right from the beginning to the end, including the extra things that will help your chances of a club to be approved.",
            "steps": [
                "Work out the plan. If you go all willy-nilly like for an example \"Okay, so we're just gonna call this club Club of Awesomeness, have it in the morning, and move on\", that's showing people that you don't care about the club. It tells them, \"This is a club that randomly popped out with no given thought whatsoever. Please risk everything and join.\" What specific time? Place? What's it about? For the time and place, decide on a room to hold the club in with your friend, and speak with the person in charge of the room. Agree with them on a time, but make it during school hours-and not during lessons or work times.\n\n\n\nPlan out how the club will run. At many schools, students start planning the club before the summer vacation. This will give time to plan the club events, fundraisers, and other necessary things to make the club flow steadily upon return to school.",
                "Choose the club's title. For example, if the club is about your school, i.e what you can do to improve it, what isn't going well, etc., for example, Cayuga Elementary School, you could call it \"Cayuga Elementary Club\". Think about what it will look like presented to other people, and how it relates to the topic.",
                "Type up your final plan or required form for the school. Choose a person (either you or your friend) to type it on a computer, print it out, and then discuss it together. Don't forget to check it for errors.",
                "Find responsible friends. You can't start a club with only one member. Every club has certain positions that need to be filled by responsible people, defined as loyal, intelligent, and hardworking. A club containing people like this will definitely succeed. Also starting to talk with the responsible friends will help in the planning of the club so that one will not have to do it by oneself beforehand.",
                "Talk to the staff. Speak to the teachers of both your classes, your friend's class (if he/she is in a different class), and your members' class/classes. If all of them agree on your plan, you may speak to the principal. If the principal agrees, move on to the next step.",
                "Find a club adviser. A club adviser is not an adult/teacher that is supposed to babysit a club; they are a trusted mentor. They also need to possess an interest in the club's activity or goal. So find the perfect one that would take an interest in the club. So that they would love to be involved making the club more active and prosperous.",
                "Spread the word to the club commissioner, if relevant for your school. Even with the best team, you still need approval. If the club commissioner which approves clubs gets the wrong idea about your club on the form,and they did not interpret the information on the form correctly, the club will unfortunately be rejected.",
                "Check to make sure everyone knows what to do before summer. Once summer vacation starts, communication may cut off. If it does happen it is best to give officers some work to do during the summer. Like planning for fundraisers. This will help if the club officers did not know what to do and goof off during the summer.",
                "Talk with the other club officers. Make sure there is a high level of communication between the club officers. Without good communication, there will be infinitely many problems occurring. For example: deliveries of fundraiser items are late. Associating with others beforehand makes it easy for an alternative or a solution.",
                "Persuade others to join. Once the club is approved, all of the work rests in the hands of the club's officers. The first thing is to get people to join.\n\n\nCreate a flyer/sign-up sheet.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Create a Club at School Step 8\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/da/Create-a-Club-at-School-Step-8.jpg/aid617573-v4-728px-Create-a-Club-at-School-Step-8.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Prepare a speech. On the first day of your club's start, make sure that the people in your club acknowledge the motive of your club and different requirements needed in the club. This will provide a clear view for the club members.",
                "Stay organized. Now that a club has started, it is not over yet. All of the hard parts may have passed, but there is still the maintenance of the club, without which the club won't stay viable.",
                "Enjoy running the club."

        "wikiHow to Cook Fried Bread": {
            "intro": "French toast:",
            "steps": [
                "Cook the fried meal that accompanies the bread (optional). Fried bread is almost always eaten with one or more other fried foods, as part of an English breakfast. This often includes eggs, English bacon, sausage, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and baked beans. Fry them all in the same pan before you start your bread.\n\n\nIf cooking all of the above, start the sausages first, the mushrooms a couple minutes later, then the other ingredients a few minutes later. Finish with the fried eggs.",
                "Add more fat or oil (optional). Depending on how much meat and butter you used in the fry-up, you might already have enough fat in the pan. But let's be honest: caloric introspection has no place when frying bread. Add a small knob of butter, a splash of flavorful vegetable oil or, more traditionally, bacon drippings or lard.",
                "Heat the oil. Turn the stove on medium-high until the oil shimmers and gives off heat. A hot pan will keep the bread crisp, instead of weighed down by soggy grease.",
                "Add sliced bread to the pan. Slightly stale white bread is perfect, as the dry slice will soak up the flavorful oil more quickly. Save that fresh loaf of whole grain for the people who want toast instead.\n\n\nSlice the bread into triangles if you have a small pan.",
                "Spice it up (optional). A small sprinkle of salt and a quick turn of the pepper mill will add some flavor, but this isn't mandatory. Cayenne pepper is another option for people who enjoy spice with their breakfast.",
                "Cook for a few seconds or until golden brown. If the pan is hot and oily enough, you'll only need a few seconds on each side to make the bread crisp, golden brown, and full of the flavors of the fried meal. If your pan was too cold and not sizzling, you may need to fry the bread for 15–30 seconds, but pull it out before it gets too soggy.",
                "Cut a hole in a slice of bread with a cookie cutter or knife. You can use just about any type of bread for this method, as long as it can be sliced without crumbling apart. Cut a hole in the center of the bread using a cookie cutter, or cut out a shape using a knife. You can fry the cut-out shape as an addition, or nibble it while you cook.\n\n\nUse a heart-shaped cookie cutter for a romantic breakfast.\nIf you use a knife, put the slice of bread flat on the cutting board, and use the tip of the knife in an up-and-down motion, perforating the bread with small holes rather than tearing through the bread directly.",
                "Heat butter or oil over medium-low. Add a generous amount of butter or cooking oil to a frying pan or skillet. Give it a minute to heat up, or a couple minutes if you are using an electric stove. It should be hot enough to give off a nice sizzle when you place the bread in.\n\n\nDon't use high heat, or the bread will burn before the egg is cooked.",
                "Place the bread in the pan. Make sure the butter or oil is spread evenly over the pan, then drop the bread slice onto it. Immediately move on to the next step.\n\n\nOptionally, add the cut-out section of bread as well, if it stayed in one piece.",
                "Crack an egg into the hole. Crack an egg directly into the hole at the center of the bread, from just above the pan.",
                "Add salt and pepper to taste. If serving guests, you can provide this on the dining table instead.\n\n\nAlternatively, cook alongside anything you would enjoy on an omelette. Try grating a few shreds of cheddar cheese and placing it over the cut-out bread shape.",
                "Flip the bread once the egg white is mostly opaque. You can cook your egg in your preferred style, but a runny egg will be easier, since the bread is less likely to char. After a minute or two, or until the egg white is mostly opaque, but still translucent in places, flip the egg and bread together with a spatula or cooking tongs.",
                "Finish frying and serve. Cook the other side of the eggy in a basket for another minute or two, until the egg white is fully cooked and firm, and the bread is brown. Now that the egg is more cooked, you can move the bread around the pan with the spatula, soaking up the butter or oil.",
                "Slice your bread. Pre-sliced bread is usually too thin and too flavorless to make good French toast, sometimes called eggy bread or French-fried bread. Instead, slice a loaf of challah, egg bread, brioche, or other thin-crust, tight-crumbed bread into slices ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 centimeters) thick.[1]\n\nIdeally, leave a fresh loaf out overnight to make it slightly dry and absorbent; fresh bread should work fine if this is not feasible.\n\"Tight-crumbed\" refers to the interior of the loaf, which should be spongy and free from large holes.",
                "Beat together eggs, dairy, and salt. Before you start frying, you'll need a soupy custard-like batter that will envelope the bread in a golden envelope. To make enough batter for eight slices of French toast, beat together the following:\n\n\n3 large eggs\nPinch of salt\n⅔ cup (160 mL) half-and-half. Substitute whole milk for a healthier alternative, or cream for an extremely rich dish.[2] Use well-shaken buttermilk instead for additional flavor.[3]\n\nUse less dairy for thin-sliced bread, or if your French toast ends up soggy.[4]",
                "Mix in flavoring. French toast can be a sweet or savory dish. Flavor your batter accordingly:\n\n\n\nFor sweet toast, mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) sugar and 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract. If you do not plan on serving the toast with maple syrup or another sugary topping, you can mix in an addition 1 or 2 tbsp (15–30 mL) sugar. Optionally, add 2 tsp (10 mL) cinnamon and/or 2 tsp (10 mL) freshly grated orange peel.[5]\n\n\nFor savory toast, mix in 5 tsp (20 mL) hot sauce, 3 tbsp (45 mL) chopped basil, and a generous amount of black pepper.[6] Parmesan, garlic, and any savory herbs can be added as well, or substitute for the other ingredients.[7]",
                "Soak the bread in the batter. Pour the batter into a wide pan, and place the slices of bread into it to soak. Many cooks prefer to whip up this recipe quickly, and only soak the bread briefly while they heat up the pan of butter. Soaking for as long as 15–20 minutes, however, will increase the amount of batter absorbed, and is recommended if you are using dense, thick slices of bread.[8]\n\nFlip the bread over once, halfway through the soaking process.",
                "Heat butter in a skillet. You'll need about 2–3 tbsp (30–45 mL) butter total, but unless you have a skillet that can fit eight slices of bread, you'll probably be dividing it into three or four batches. Melt the butter in the pan, and heat until it foams and subsides.\n\n\nYou can use a neutral-flavored cooking oil such as canola oil or peanut oil instead, but the dish will be less flavorful.\nA small amount of oil mixed with the butter will prevent it from burning. This may be helpful on an electric stovetop or skillets that heat unevenly.",
                "Fry the bread. Drop as much bread as comfortably fits in the pan. Fry until golden brown on one side, then flip and cook the other side. This will only take a couple minutes on each side.\n\n\nIf you have additional slices of battered bread to fry, quickly wipe up the remaining butter with a dry paper towel, then melt more butter in the pan before adding the next slices.\nSpreading custard is a sign that your pan is not hot enough, or that there is too much liquid in your batter.[9]",
                "Serve the French toast. French toast can be served plain, or with a variety of toppings. Try maple syrup, fresh fruit, or powdered sugar for sweet varieties. Savory French toast can be eaten with pesto, sautéed vegetables, or Parmesan."

        "wikiHow to Deal With a Newly Detected Breast Lump": {
            "intro": "If you do regular breast self-exams, that is great, but it is not required. Receiving regular mammograms and physicals along with performing self-checks are preventative steps that you might take. What happens if you actually find a lump? First, don't panic. Second, educate yourself about different types of lumps. Third, take action.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Become familiar with how your breasts feel. You might not spend the time checking yourself out each month because cancer doesn't run in your family, you are young, you feel healthy, or maybe you tend to put things off. However, you may want to familiarize yourself with how healthy breasts normally feel.[2] Do this right after a period because this is when natural breast lumps will be at their smallest.\n\n\nThe upper breast tissue either feels long and thick or uneven and rounded.\nThe lower breast feels smoother.\nSome random spots feel slightly bumpy normally; just be aware of changes each month.",
                "Know the warning signs. Different symptoms will alert you to a possible problem. Being familiar with each of them is something that you should add to your to-do-list! Educating ourselves is the best defense when it comes our health.[3]\n\nBe aware that some tenderness or lumpiness can occur around the time of your period. If it doesn't go away by your next cycle, be concerned.[4]\n\nIf your breasts get red, become irritated, or the skin is flaky, you might want to see a doctor.[5]\n\nIf your nipple looks like it is flipped inside out (unless it usually looks this way), make an appointment.[6]\n\nIf your nipples produce any red, brown, yellow, or clear fluids, it's time for a check-up.[7]",
                "Set an appointment and keep calm. It is integral that you do not delay seeking a physician's advice if you notice a change in or around your breasts. It is always better to be informed. Avoid thinking about the worse case scenario at this point, though.[8]\n\nMake your appointment as soon as possible. The longer that you wait, the worse off you will be if the tumor or other symptom is a sign of cancer.\nTalk to friends and co-workers. Ask other women if they've ever had a similar experience and ask about the outcome. Hearing some positive stories will stop you from completely losing it.\nPanicking just gets your cortisol levels going. An uptake in cortisol is going to make you crave sugary, fatty, no-good-for-you foods. Drink some chamomile tea and calm down, as you need to stay healthy.",
                "Learn about the different types of breast lumps. It might be scary when you find a lump or other abnormality. Don't freak out, though! It is more than likely that your lump is not cancerous, but you must receive confirmation of that from a doctor.[9]\n\nSome lumps are just cysts. Cysts, which are filled with fluid, occur due to hormonal changes and it is common for women to experience them at some point in their lives.[10]\n\nOther lumps might just be benign tumors. These are the result of tissue that has simply formed too quickly and is a bit abnormal as a result.[11]\n\nYou might be experiencing mastitis. This is an infection and the primary cause is breastfeeding. It can easily be treated with antibiotics.[12]",
                "Consult your health insurance company if you have one. If you go for an initial appointment and your doctor recommends further action, it is crucial to educate yourself about their policies so that you don’t receive bills from your local hospital or doctor’s office and faint when you see the amount.[13]\n\nFigure out if you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see other specialists.\nLearn the percentage of your doctor’s visits and tests that your insurer will pay.\nBe aware of the deductible amounts for in-network and out-of-network services that you are responsible for.",
                "Find assistance if you don’t have insurance. There is no reason to think that you can't get treatment just because you don't have coverage. There are many options available to you. Don't risk your health. Make sure that you take action![14]\n\nIf you are not sure where to start, try a women’s center at a local college.\nYou can also try social services or the department of health in your city.\nTalk to someone at a hospital. Some states offer financial assistance to low-income people when it comes to health care. A hospital worker may help you learn about such programs.\nThere are also organizations dedicated to breast cancer education that provide resources.",
                "Conduct research to find the best physician available to you. Most doctors have websites that highlight their degrees and expertise. If the site offers a video of the clinician, watch it to see if you like his or her vibe. Even though you’re in the early stages, you want to ensure that your doctor can diagnosis you accurately.[15]\n\nStart with those in your network if you have health insurance. If you don’t, still look into the physicians that are available to you.\nYou can also check doctor’s ratings online. Remember that one or two low ratings aren’t a big deal, but shy away from those who hardly have any positive comments.\nAsking friends, colleagues, and family members for referrals is a great way to feel more secure, too.",
                "Get ready for a clinical breast exam. The first step that your doctor will take is to conduct a thorough examination, similar to a regular physical. Go to the appointment with a positive outlook and remain calm.[16]\n\nYour doctor will ask you many questions about your general health, specific symptoms, and whether or not cancer runs in the family.[17]\n\nThen, your doctor will look at the skin on your breasts as well as the nipples to check for any warning signs.[18]\n\nFinally, your doctor will press on your breasts and armpit area to check for other lumps or problems.[19]",
                "Undergo imaging tests. Another method that doctors commonly use is to conduct one or several types of tests that involve taking a picture of your breasts. This type of procedure will help your doctor determine whether or not the lump is cancerous and what the next step should be.[20]\n\nA common test is the mammogram. It is a type of x-ray specifically for the breast and will zone in on specific parts of the breast so that your doctor can take a closer look.[21]\n\nAlternatively or in addition, you might need an ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves to produce information about your breast, specifically regarding whether or not a breast lump contains fluid.[22]\n\nIf diagnosing you poses challenges, your doctor might also suggest an MRI or ductogram, which involve the use of dye to emphasize the appearance of breast tissues for further scrutiny.[23]",
                "Let your doctor perform a biopsy if she or he deems it necessary. During a biopsy, the doctor removes a tiny piece of tissue from your breast. This is a common procedure that is not incredibly evasive. The results will help shed more light on what is going on.[24]\n\nTwo options are core needle and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Different needles are used to withdraw tissue from your breast. Core needle allows your doctor to take a larger sample.[25]\n\nThe stereotactic method involves a needle too, but before using it, your specialist will also take more images of your breast.[26]\n\nWith a vacuum-assisted biopsy, your doctor will numb and cut your breast to take the tissue sample.[27]\n\nFinally, during a surgical biopsy, the doctor actually removes part of the lump. You will be medicated so that you don’t experience pain.[28]",
                "Prepare for more doctor’s visits even if the lump is non-cancerous. Your doctor will need to see you for follow-ups to make sure that you stay healthy. Try not to be annoyed by having to go to these appointments. Instead, be thankful that you are cancer-free![29]\n\nDuring most of the visits, you will just chat with your doctor about how you are feeling. If you feel tired, have gained or lost weight, or experience pain, let your doctor know.[30]\n\nOccasionally, the doctor or nurse will take blood from you or give you an x-ray to rule out presence of cancer in the body.[31]\n\nOf course, you may need yearly mammograms depending on what the lump was, so that you can ensure that no new lumps have formed.[32]",
                "Educate yourself if the lump is cancerous. All is not lost even if you don’t receive a favorable diagnosis. In this modern age, there are many types of treatments and many knowledgeable doctors out there. Don’t be too proud or shy to ask for needed help.[33]\n\nFeel free to get a second opinion. If your doctor doesn’t seem super knowledgeable or you just want confirmation from an additional source, see someone else for peace of mind.[34]\n\nGet help with your pathology report. This document explains what the specialist found when examining your breast tissue sample taken during the biopsy. It will help your doctor decide how to treat you. Have someone in the doctor’s office help you break down unfamiliar terms.[35]\n\nAsk your doctor pertinent questions. If the lump is cancerous, find out what stage you’re at and how it might influence your health and longevity. Inquire about other tests that you might be subject to, and learn about any timelines in regards to making decisions and receiving care.[36]",
                "Join a support group. If you experience mental or emotional anguish during or after the screenings or follow up appointments, know that many other women are going through the same thing. There are many benefits to talking with other people, so give it a try to see if helps you feel better.[37]\n\nSpeaking with those who can understand your ordeal will make you feel less stressed because you are able to vent about what you’ve been through.[38]\n\nMany support groups offer relaxation techniques, which can also help you relieve stress. Rhythmic breathing and guided imagery are two of the more popular strategies that you might try during meetings.[39]\n\nOnce you feel stronger, you might be able to co-lead discussions and provide one-on-one guidance to someone who is in the earlier stages. Doing so will make you feel purposeful and will ease emotional burdens.[40]"

        "wikiHow to Diagnose Patellar Luxation in Shih Tzus": {
            "intro": "Patellar luxation is a common disease that affects the back legs of many dogs, especially small breeds such as the Shih Tzu.[1] The patella is the technical name for a kneecap, and luxation simply means sliding out of place. This condition is also known as sliding or floating kneecaps. Learn how to diagnose patellar luxation in Shih Tzus so you can get your pet proper treatment.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for skipping on the back leg. A typical sign of patellar luxation is when the dog skips on a back leg. He may be perfectly mobile and not in pain, but every now and again he skips a step. He may also carry a back leg for several steps before putting it back down again.[2]\n\nThis is due to the mechanical locking of the knee joint due to the faulty anatomy. After a few steps, things tend to shake back into place and the dog continues to walk as normal.\nPatellar luxation occurs in the back legs. This means your dog may move all the weight into the front legs.",
                "Watch for difficulty jumping. It is possible in some dogs for both legs to be affected by patellar luxation. If this is the case, the dog may look like he’s doing a bunny hop with both legs together.[3]\n\nIf your dog has the condition in both legs, he may have difficulty jumping up onto furniture or low surfaces.",
                "Monitor for other leg problems. In severe or long term cases, the dog may develop secondary problems. One secondary problem may be arthritis in the joint. There may be swelling or stiffness in the leg or joint. If the dog is using the leg less, he may also develop muscle wastage on that side, which means the muscles on the affected side will be smaller than the ones on the other side.[4]\n\nYour dog may also exhibit lameness on the affected leg. Lameness means your dog won't have the ability to walk on that leg.",
                "Recognize the symptoms at any age. A dog can get patellar luxation at any age. Many dogs often present symptoms as a puppy because it is a problem with the muscles of the legs. Dogs can start presenting symptoms at at eight to 10 weeks.[5]",
                "Get a physical exam. If you believe your dog has patellar luxation, you should take him to the vet. The vet can perform a physical exam to check for the condition. First, the vet will watch the dog walking and feel the back legs. The vet is feeling for muscle wastage, along with sideways movement in the kneecap that shouldn't be there.[6]\n\nIt is possible to diagnose a luxating patella by feel alone since the kneecap can be felt popping out of place when the leg is straightened during the exam.\nIn cases that are not clear cut, the vet may straighten the leg and put a slight sideways pressure on the kneecap. This can be enough to encourage the patella to pop out of place.",
                "X-ray the leg. Even if the vet suspects a luxating patella from the physical exam, the leg will be x-rayed so as to fully assess the underlying anatomy. This is especially important if corrective surgery is being considered.\n\n\nThe vet will want to look at the radiographs to check the angles of the bones, which gives essential information about what surgical procedures are most appropriate for that individual.",
                "Manage the condition in mild cases. For mild cases of patellar luxation, you can manage your dog’s pain and inflammation with NSAIDs. Your vet will also give you a physical rehabilitation exercise program for your dog to help build strength in the thigh muscle.[7]\n\nYou should also control your dog’s weight. Added weight from obesity can put more stress on the knee joint.",
                "Undergo surgery in severe cases. In dogs that are regularly skipping a step or having difficulty jumping, this could indicate the changes are more marked, in which case corrective surgery could protect the joint from early arthritis.\n\n\nCorrective surgery involves deepening the groove that the kneecap sits in, tightening the joint capsule, and sometimes changing the angle of the shin bone so that the patella sits in a straighter line with the thigh bone.[8]",
                "Know what patellar luxation is. The kneecap is a vital part of knee anatomy. The knee is a hinge joint made up of the femur, or thigh bone, from above and the tibia, or shin bone, from below. When the large thigh muscle contracts, it pulls on the shin bone and causes the knee to straighten. However, it does not pull directly on the shin bone but via a pulley system formed by the patella.[9] For this system to work, the thigh muscle needs to pull in a straight line. What happens with a luxating patella is that the forces pull at an angle and the kneecap pops out of place.\n\n\nThe problems which allow or encourage the kneecap to slip can vary. One problem is a slack joint capsule that means the kneecap isn't tightly anchored. Another is that the groove the patella sits in is too shallow, which allows sideways movement that shouldn't be there. The muscles may also pull at an angle because of the bowed natures of the dog's hind leg bones.[10]",
                "Determine if your dog is at risk. Small dogs are especially prone to luxating patellas. This means that the Shih Tzu breed is especially likely to have this condition. Patella luxation is common in dogs that have shortened legs or bowed legs, such as the dachshund, Lhasa apso, Yorkshire terrier, or Shih Tzu.\n\n\nAny age can be affected, but signs often show at a young age because this is a mechanical problem with the direction of pull of muscles and anatomy. Many dogs begin showing signs at eight to 10 weeks.[11]",
                "Understand that there are four grades of the condition. The severity of the condition is determined based on four different grades. The mildest case is considered a Grade 1 while the most severe is a Grade 4. Grade 1 is when the kneecap just pops out of place and returns naturally. Grade 2 is similar, but occasionally the kneecap needs help to manually pop it back in.[12]\n\nGrade 3 is when the kneecap stops popping back into place on its own. The kneecap is popped out unless it is manually popped back in. It will only stay in place for a short while.\nGrade 4 is the most severe case. The kneecap stays popped out and won’t pop back into place even when manually moved."

                "Let your daughter try to be like you. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and it also indicates that your daughter is trying to learn her cues for behavior from you. If your daughter tries to mimic your body language, activities, or routines, invite her to participate and to learn from you. However, keep in mind that she is an individual. Encourage her to participate in activities with you, but let her explore her own interests.\n\n\nSet good examples. If you have negative feelings toward your looks or body shape, you risk passing on these same issues to your daughter.

Make a commitment to go on a date or make a home-cooked meal together at least once a week. Here are some date night ideas:\n\n\nGo to dinner and a movie. This classic never gets old if you switch up the restaurant and the movie genre each week.\nMake dinner together. Try making a dish that requires more effort than one you would make on a random weeknight. Make pizza from scratch to have fun while cooking.\nGo on a picnic in the spring and summer. A romantic picnic in a meadow or on a beach is a great way to get outdoors and spend some time together.\nGo ice skating in winter. Hold hands with your hubby and glide on the ice.\nDo something adventurous, like an extreme sport. You could go rock climbing, snowboarding, surfing, etc.",
                "Send flirty text messages throughout the day. Sometimes nothing is better than a spontaneous text or voice message from your lover. Call just to say \"I love you\" or send your hubby a flirty message that contains something for him to look forward to.\n\n\nSend sexy snap chats to your hubby to remind him what's waiting for him after work. Make sure to warn him that you sent a sexy snap in advance, so that he doesn't open it in front of his friends, or worse, his colleagues.\nPut a video or website link on his FaceBook page to something that has a special meaning to your relationship. This could be the music video to a love song, or a clip of your favorite comedy show, etc.",
                "Get some new sexy outfits. If you're constantly wallowing around the house in sweatpants, it might be time to take a trip to the mall for some new clothes. There's nothing wrong with being comfortable in front of your hubby, but be sure to always take care of yourself as well.\n\n\nSpice up a plain outfit with a sexy blouse or dress.\nPut on a pair of stilettos to elongate your legs. Every man loves long, sexy legs. A pair of heels are a quick and easy way to make any outfit look sexier.\nGet some new lingerie. Lingerie is a sexy way to spice up your bedroom life and make your hubby see you in a new light.",
                "Have an attractive and confident attitude. Being attractive isn't all about looking sexy, it's about exuding a confident and compassionate attitude as well. Be sure to retain a kind disposition toward your husband and be considerate of his feelings always.\n\n\nExude happiness. As humans, we're all going to have good days and bad days. While you shouldn't try to mask your feelings if you are feeling sad or depressed, you should try to be a pleasant person to be around whenever possible.\nSmile. Visual signals are just as important as words. Avoid walking around with a scowl on your face all day and try to smile as much as possible.",
                "Exercise. This might sound like a plea to get you to work out for the sake of a sexy body, but exercise can provide you with so much more than a slim frame and ripped abs. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, neurotransmitters that reduce stress and induce happiness.\n\n\nMaintaining a steady exercise routine has also been shown to increase sexual desire as a result of the positive effects working out has on your body and mind.\nTry stress-reducing exercises like yoga, or energy-inducing exercises like running.\nDon't overlook the positive effect that simply feeling sexy can have one your love life. When you feel desirable, your confidence and sexuality shine through.[1]",
                "Go to concerts together. Get tickets to go see one of his favorite bands live. Concerts are extremely memorable experiences that create unique feelings each time.",
                "Take a spontaneous road trip. Pack up the car while your hubby is away from home and drive to a location you have both been wanting to visit for awhile. Make a play list for the road trip that represents your relationship.",
                "Stay up all night for a movie marathon. Does he have a favorite movie producer? Compile all of your hubby's favorite movies, heat up some popcorn, and waste away the night watching them all. While you might fall asleep in the process, staying up for a movie marathon can be fun and give you and your hubby some quality cuddle time at home.",
                "Go camping. A rustic outing can be extremely romantic - especially when it's a night spent under the stars together. Take the bare essentials and head to the woods to spend some time alone on a mini vacation that won't break the bank.",
                "Leave love notes around the house. Scatter little love notes around the house where your hubby will see them. But don't stop there, put cute notes in his clothes pockets or stick an \"I love you\" on his car steering wheel. Little gestures like these will make him smile throughout the day and can really go a long way.",
                "Introduce him to something new. Did you recently read an awesome book or discover an awesome new band? Share your findings with your husband. Introducing new things into your relationship gives you more to talk about together.",
                "Frame a picture of the two of you. A picture is truly worth a thousand words, and framing a picture of you and your husband is a great way to show him how much you care. Alternately, you can make a collage of your last vacation together or simply of your favorite moments throughout the years to remind him of all the good times you have had together.",
                "Make him a homemade gift. Coupon books are a great (and inexpensive!) way to show someone that you love them. Get creative and give your hubby coupons for romantic activities that can be redeemed at any time. Some ideas include:\n\n\nMassages.\nIntimate activities.\nHis favorite home-cooked meal.\nControl of the television.\nA trip to his favorite restaurant.\nPasses to get out of doing chores.",
                "Make his favorite dinner or dessert. Food can truly nourish the soul, and putting a lot of effort into a home-cooked meal can really show someone how much you love them. Take the time to make your hubby's favorite dish or dessert every once in a while. Make it a surprise to add an extra element of romance.",
                "Compile a playlist or mix CD. Take the time to make a playlist of your hubby's favorite songs or find new songs that you think he will like. You can also make a playlist of love songs that you have listened to at one time or another during your relationship.\n\n\nGive it to your hubby in cute wrapping paper with a little note explaining the significance of the playlist to you.\nAlternately, stick it in his car CD player and set it so that it will play the next time he turns on his car. This sneaky addition will have your hubby smiling and soon as he buckles his seat belt.",
                "Give him something from nature. Collect something from a place in nature that is special to you. This can be a rock in the shape of a heart, a shell from the beach, or even a tree branch from your favorite hike. Let your hubby know that this token from nature reminds you of him.",
                "Keep things clean. This doesn't mean you should do all the cleaning in the house all the time, but you should both share in the responsibilities of creating a comfortable home. Try not to take over your shared room by throwing your clothes and makeup everywhere.",
                "Greet him warmly. If you're at home when your man gets home, greet him with a smooch and a smile. Doing so immediately sets a positive tone for your subsequent interaction and reinforces the home as a comfortable, happy place.[2]",
                "Cook meals together. Share in the responsibility of creating dinners that you two can enjoy together. Dinner is a time to share about your day and actually engage with your husband deeply. Avoid opting for the frozen, pre-packaged dinner and make a meal that you can enjoy together.",
                "Make DIY home improvements together. Take a weekend to work on a home project together. Building or painting something collectively to improve your home can be a rewarding experience. When you produce something together for each other, the results are extremely gratifying.",
                "Invite his family over for dinner. When you've made your house into a comfortable place that represents your relationship, invite your hubby's family over for brunch or dinner. Your husband will appreciate your effort in reaching out to his family and trying to make them feel comfortable, welcome, and loved.",
                "Avoid becoming just roommates. It's easy to get so comfortable with each other that you almost feel like roommates in your own home. Make sure you continue to be affectionate in your home by cuddling, touching, and kissing throughout the day. Don't let all of your inhibitions fly out the door once you are living with each other. It's still extremely rude and inconsiderate to let your bodily functions fly, not to mention it's a huge turn off.",
                "Make time for yourself. The rather comical old saying, \"A happy wife means a happy life,\" actually holds a lot of weight in a marriage situation.\n\n\nIn order for your husband to be happy with you, you first have to be secure and happy in your own skin. Being happy stems from different behaviors, feelings, and experiences for each individual person, just make sure you are leaving time to take care of yourself in addition to your husband.",
                "Reserve time to hang out with friends individually. It is important that both you and your husband take the time to nurture the relationships you have with other people in your life as well. Friends are an important part of any person's life and spending time alone with friends helps build balance in your life.\n\n\nMake one night a week dedicated to hanging out separately with friends. By choosing the same night, neither spouse will feel neglected as the other hangs out with friends.\nDon't talk about your spouse the entire time you hang out with your friends. Allow this time to be a sort of break from your busy, married life and re-engage with your friends and what is going on in their lives.",
                "Don't lose sight of your interests. It's wonderful if you and your spouse share the same interests, but make sure that you each retain your own hobbies too. If you love to read and he loves to golf, give each other space to do those things. You don't have to share everything all the time, and by giving each other space you can actually strengthen your relationship.",
                "Be honest with each other. Communication is key in any relationship. Be sure to tell each other how you are feeling, even if it is uncomfortable to do so. If you feel like you've been making a strong effort to make your husband happy and he isn't returning the love, tell him so! Often all you need to do to make an important change is communicate what is lacking."

        "wikiHow to Write a Vision Statement": {
            "intro": "Vision statements should describe the essential goals an organization sets for itself. Even though the actual vision statement should be simple and direct, writing it requires time and careful consideration.",
            "steps": [
                "Address your core values. Identify the values that exist at the center of your organization. Ask yourself why your organization currently exists and what hopes or ideas led to its founding.[1]\n\nAfter identifying your core values, you'll need to evaluate your organization with respect to those values. Determine which aspects of your company are aligned to those values and which aren't, then consider what you should do to better align yourself to those values in the future.\nYour vision statement should match up to your organization's core values. To that end, you'll need to retain any elements that currently fulfill your values while also incorporating new elements that can address those values more effectively.",
                "Focus on problem solving. Companies typically succeed when they can solve a problem or provide something that fulfills various needs and wants. Determine what problems or needs your company addresses.\n\n\nIf you haven't done so already, identify your customer base and figure out what concerns the average customer within that base. Create an \"ideal customer\" in your mind, then ask yourself what you want to do for that specific customer.\nAfter determining what you want to do for your target customer, think about how success will look if you manage to accomplish that goal. The idea of success that you imagine here should morph easily into the overall vision you hold for your organization.",
                "Visualize the future. If you have a hard time identifying your vision from your current perspective, try to imagine your organization five to ten years later.\n\n\nIt may help to draft an imaginary news article describing your organization's ideal future. Write about its biggest accomplishments and compare it to the competition. The accomplishments you hope to achieve should be transformed into elements of your vision.",
                "Dream big and scale down as needed. When you start brainstorming, don't worry too much about how realistic your goals seem. Only evaluate the practicality of your dreams after getting them out into the open.\n\n\nFor instance, your ultimate goal might involve global success even if your organization is currently a local, small-scale operation. List global success among your dreams during the brainstorming state, then evaluate the practicality of that dream once you sit down to write out your actual statement. Scale back the reach of your goal as needed to make it seem easier for others to grasp.",
                "Define your output. Your input is what you put into your organization. Your output is the result of those efforts. Use wording that focuses on your output rather than your input.[2]\n\nFor example, a clothing boutique stocks designer clothes and sells those clothes to fashion-minded customers. The \"stocking clothes\" part is the boutique's input; introducing customers to those clothes is the boutique's output.",
                "Be specific to your business. Avoid writing generic statements that could apply to any company in any field. At the very least, you need to make sure that your vision statement addresses the industry your company exists within.[3]\n\nSomething generic like “customer satisfaction” won't paint a vivid enough picture. In this case, you'll need to describe what customer satisfaction looks like within your field. For something like a clothing boutique, this would mean pairing fashion-minded customers with the best styles or introducing them to the latest trends.",
                "Give it a twist. Even within the same field, your organization has plenty of competition to work with. If there's something positive about your business model that varies from others within the field, reference it within your vision statement.\n\n\nFor instance, if you own a clothing boutique and a large portion of your stock comes from local artisans, mention that in your vision statement. Doing so could help attract those interested in supporting local business.",
                "Focus on the future. Vision statements describe goals. In other words, you're conveying something you hope to make happen rather than something that is currently happening or currently true of your organization.\n\n\nFor this reason, most vision statements rely on action-oriented verbs: \"to be,\" \"to become,\" \"to make,\" etc. Instead of saying what your company is, describe what you hope your company will be in the future.",
                "Balance ambition with realism. The statement needs to be ambitious enough to excite people, but it also needs a dose of realism. If it doesn't seem achievable, you might have a hard time finding support.\n\n\nThis is when you may need to start scaling back the “big dreams” you included in your initial brainstorming sessions. If you own a small business but are on a clear path toward global success, that might be a legitimate goal you can include in your vision statement. Typically, though, you'll need to redefine the scope of your vision to a smaller scale that will be easier for others to accept, like your community, your state, or your country.",
                "Draw in the senses. While it isn't strictly necessary, addressing the \"real life\" senses of your potential supporters allows you to plant an image in their minds, and that image can make your organization's vision easier to remember.\n\n\nThe simplest way to do this is typically with a visual. For instance, instead of making \"happy customers\" your goal, describe your goal as \"smiling customers.\" The latter creates an image, and that image conveys a stronger message.",
                "Limit the length to one sentence. Your vision statement should be short enough to memorize, so aim for one sentence consisting of 10 to 15 words.[4]\n\nAt most, you vision statement should consist of no more than two sentences and/or 30 words. If you feel the need to have a long, detailed vision statement, you should also create an abbreviated version that's easy to recite from memory.",
                "Use clear, simple language. Aside from brevity, a good vision statement also expresses clarity. Avoid complicated wording or inactive phrasing.\n\n\nPeople both inside and outside of your organization should be able to understand the statement, so avoid technical jargon, industry buzzwords, and metaphors.\nAvoid using past tense or the passive voice. You're looking toward the future, so your language needs to do the same.",
                "Adjust as needed. Don't expect to craft the perfect vision statement from the first draft. You should go through at least two drafts of your vision statement, if not more.\n\n\nDuring your first draft, only focus on getting everything down that needs to go down. Think about things like length and language, but avoid fixating on them.\nReview your first draft and revise it as needed, paying closer attention to the finer points you skimmed over previously. Keep the elements that seem most important to you, but rephrase poor wording and remove elements that weigh things down without adding much value.",
                "Seek feedback. Once you feel satisfied with your vision statement, ask someone else to review it. Choose someone who has both wisdom and integrity. This may include mentors, colleagues, or marketing professionals.\n\n\nUnderstand that you may receive both positive and negative feedback. When your statement is criticized, ask yourself if the criticism genuinely seems warranted. Seek a second opinion if you aren't sure.\nRevise your vision statement again if you receive negative criticism that makes sense. When you finish, return it to the original critic and ask him or her to evaluate the effectiveness of your changes.",
                "Spread the vision. Once you complete the final draft of your vision statement, you'll need to spread it around. Communicate your vision to your employees, investors, and potential customers.\n\n\nFollow your vision statement as sincerely as possible, too. If you aren't letting your vision statement guide the path your organization takes, you didn't craft an effective or true statement.\nYour company and industry will naturally change over time, of course, and your vision statement may grow outdated. When that happens, reevaluate your vision and start the process anew to create an improved statement that better reflects the current times."

        "wikiHow to Donate Your Body to Science": {
            "intro": "For some people, making a contribution to society doesn't stop with their death. Many choose to donate their organs, and some opt to donate their body to science. For those who do the latter, it's often because the life of someone they care about (or their own) was saved with medical technology or a certain procedure. Some may have a desire to \"give back\" so that more treatments can be developed and more lives can be saved.[1] Learn how to make this choice, discuss it with your family, and fill out the paperwork to give your body to science.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand what happens when you donate your body to science. Before you die, you will have chosen a facility or program and filled out the necessary paperwork. After your die, someone will contact the facility or program which will usually collect your body. Once they have your body, several things could be done with it.\n\n\nDonated bodies are used for testing new medical tools and equipment, testing car safety products, studying stages of advanced decay, studied for anatomy purposes, and testing new surgeries, among other things.[2]",
                "Choose between donating your organs or donating your body to science. Understand the pros and cons of each. With donating your organs, your family can still have hold a service for you and you can specify in advance which organs you'd like to donate. With body donation, your family may not get the chance to say goodbye before the body is collected. You also won't be able to specify how it is used. Decide how much control you'd like to have over what happens to your body after your death.[3]\n\nConsider the great need for donated organs. Every day about 79 people receive an organ transplant while 18 die waiting for a donor. One organ donor can save 8 lives.\nMost programs want a complete body donation. Other programs request that you pre-register any planned organ donations before donating your body.[4]",
                "Understand when body donation is not accepted. Some programs will not accept very obese bodies and most will not take bodies with certain medical conditions, like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, hepatitis, HIV, or tuberculosis.[5]\n\nBodies that suffered extensive trauma or advanced decomposition won't be accepted either.[6]",
                "Research programs and facilities. Look at programs for willed body donation within your state. When you do this, you should keep in mind what's important to you. Here are a few of the things to consider when comparing available programs/facilities:[7]\n\nCosts: Some programs will pay for body transport to the medical school, while others will charge. Find out what your family will be responsible for paying.\nFuneral or memorial options: Most programs will require almost immediate transportation of the body to the facility. You may want to find out when your cremated remains will be available to your family, if planning a service. They may be available several years after your death.\nAssistance from the program: Some programs perform a memorial service after the body has been used and before it's cremated. The program will complete the death certificate and might give information for an obituary.\nType of program: Some programs and facilities only use donated bodies for anatomical study. Others might use them as forensic tools to solve crimes, such as studying advanced decay. Make sure you're comfortable with what the program will do with your body.",
                "Inform your doctor and family members. It's important that you tell your family about your decision before your death. If you do your research and make necessary preparations, your family won't be left trying to understand your wishes. If you don't inform your family, this surprise could delay them in getting your body to the right facility in time.\n\n\nCheck with the program you're using about transportation costs. Most programs will pay to transport your body to the facility, but if you die far enough away from the facility, your family may be responsible for paying to get you there.[8]",
                "Discuss funeral or memorial options. Your family will not be able to hold a funeral with your body present and they should be prepared for this. It may affect their ability to find closure. Inform them that they can still hold a memorial service or attend a commemoration service at the facility where your body was donated.[9]\n\nGenerally, the school will cover the cost of cremation once the body is no longer being used for study, and some schools have a cemetery plot where they will bury the bodies if that is requested. But, if your next-of-kin want the remains to be given back to them, they may end up having to cover the costs of cremation or burial.",
                "Make alternative arrangements. While you may be a good candidate for body donation and you've correctly filled out the paperwork, your body may end up being rejected. If your body decomposed, suffered trauma, or experienced a major operation, you may not actually be accepted. Decide what you'd like done if body donation does not work out.[10]\n\nAgain, make these wishes clear to your family, since they'll be fulfilling them after your death. It's always a good idea to put it into writing and notify your attorney.\nRemember that you may be able to donate your organs even if you couldn't donate your body. While the decision to harvest suitable organs will be made at the time of your death, you should fill out paperwork and inform your family in advance.[11] This way, if your body isn't accepted, your organs may be.",
                "Get the correct forms. Once you've decided to donate your body to science and have selected a specific program or facility, make sure to get a registration packet. This will usually contain details and the consent form. This form must be completed, returned, and acknowledged.\n\n\nYou may be given a wallet card to notify people of your intention to donate at the time of death. Carry it with you at all times.",
                "Comply with details of the form. Some programs require you to fill out and sign the form in front of witnesses or a notary public. Be sure to read these details before filling out any paperwork.\n\n\nFor example, you may need multiple witnesses over the age of 21. Some programs specify that one witness must be a family member while the other should have legal ties to the family (like an attorney).[12]",
                "Update your paperwork. Just because you've successfully filled out and filed your body donation paperwork doesn't mean you're all set. You need to update your will to stipulate the program details of the body donation. This is especially important if you fear your family may not honor your wishes after your death.\n\n\nIf you change your mind about donating your body, you can always opt out of the program. To do this, notify the program in writing and file a copy with your attorney.[13]",
                "Understand and inform your family about the procedure after your death. While you may understand what will happen to your body after death, your family might be clueless about what it is they're supposed to do. In most cases, your next of kin, spouse, executor of your will, or hospital facility will need to immediately get in touch with the medical program after your death.[14] The facility will usually come pick up the body.\n\n\nHave all the necessary program information and contact details available for your family so they aren't burdened with details while dealing with your death."

        "wikiHow to Run a Dinner Fundraiser": {
            "intro": "Fundraising dinners are a tried and true way to raise money for your cause, whether you’re a church, school, non-profit, or political candidate. While the size and expense may differ from event to event, the fundamentals remain the same. To get the most out of your event, you’ll need to plan carefully, advertise intelligently, be prepared to troubleshoot, and make sure to capitalize on the momentum generated by your event.",
            "steps": [
                "Set your goal. Decide how much you want to raise, i.e. your net gain after expenses are deducted.[1] Linking your goal directly to a clear objective will make it easier to get people to attend. Perhaps you’re raising money to cover the cost of a new roof for your coop nursery school, or to send a missionary to China. Don’t just raise money. Raise it for a reason.\n\n\nFirst, decide the specific thing you are trying to accomplish, then analyze how much it will cost. If raising money for a new roof, for instance, you would want to cost the project with contractors. If raising money to help cover general costs at a nursery school, you would want to know total costs (last year’s, plus expected additional costs for the coming year) and total expected revenue (tuition) in order to set a goal.\nGoals should be specific, measurable, and achievable.[2] The last of these is important. Set high goals, but be realistic about whether you can achieve them. Not everyone you invite will attend your fundraising dinner. If you have an auction, not everything will sell.\nDo research or ask around to determine how much people are willing to pay for tickets before you set the price. You don’t want to price people out, but you also want to be sure you hit your goals.",
                "Set up your team. Regardless of the scale of your event, you will need to assign staff or volunteers to coordinate various portions of the dinner:\n\n\nInvitations and marketing\nSales and donations\nLocation and decorations\nFood and catering\nEntertainment\nSpecial events (auction, bake sale, etc.)\nSet up and break down\nThank you notes",
                "Establish a host committee. If you are running a foundation or non-profit with high level donors, you will want to call on wealthy donors, business leaders, and local celebrities to set up a “host committee” – people who contribute large amounts to the event and encourage others to do so as well.[3]\n\nTry to reach out first to people who have shown a past interest in the cause your dinner seeks to fund. Call or meet with them to discuss the event, why it is important, and how they can help.[4]\n\nAlso be sure to include key stakeholders – for example an executive from a corporation sponsoring your event.[5]\n\nThough your committee is geared mostly towards soliciting donations, it helps to create subcommittees with clearly defined tasks – volunteer recruitment, fundraising and sponsorship, entertainment – so that committee members feel ownership of the entire event without feeling overburdened.[6]",
                "Create a budget. You can’t decide how much to charge for tickets, or how many additional activities you’ll need (auctions, bake sales, etc.) until you know your budget. List all expenses, such as:[7]\n\nStaff.\nInvitations.\nSpace rental.\nCatering.\nEntertainment.\nTransportation.\nSecurity.\nUtilities.\nExtra for unforeseen costs.",
                "Choose a space. If preparing your own food, you will need access to somewhere with a kitchen. Schools or churches can save money by hosting the event. Non-profits with interesting settings, like zoos and libraries, should also consider hosting. For most dinner fundraisers, though, you will want to rent a space. When renting, be sure to ask these questions:[8]\n\nDoes the venue offer discount rates for non-profits?\nAre there days of the week the space costs less?\nIf you are a large scale non-profit with many members, ask if they are willing to donate space in return for free advertising in your promotional materials (emails, flyers, Facebook page, etc.).\nWill the vendor consider waiving costs like security, cleanup, etc. for non-profits?\nAre they willing to give a percentage of the food or alcohol tab back to your cause?",
                "Decide on food. Are you going to cater the event or make your own? Is it going to be buffet style or a sit-down meal? Will there be desert? Coffee? Alcohol? Remember, the more you spend on food, the more you will have to charge for tickets if you want to hit your fundraising goals.\n\n\nTable service is more formal, but is also more time consuming and expensive. A buffet is less formal and less expensive.\nIf making your own food, consider picking a meal that is easy to prepare for lots of people like spaghetti with salad and garlic bread, or hamburgers and veggieburgers with salad.[9] Having guests bring dessert will save on time and money.[10]\n\nIf catering, ask if local restaurants will consider catering for free in lieu of a donation. Mention that this will be great advertising for their business.\nYou’ll also need to have a plan for what to do with leftover food. Consider donating it.",
                "Think about adding entertainment. For expensive dinners, you will want to consider live music, and perhaps a speaker. A band also goes over well for churches or schools, but also consider using free talent – a talent show, the school band or the church choir.[11]",
                "Consider combining your dinner with an auction or bake sale. Auctions, in particular, can bring in a lot of extra money, but they take work. You’ll need an auction coordinator to solicit donations from local businesses. For schools and churches, also consider having the parents or members donate their own skills or prepare their own items, like gift baskets.",
                "Know your audience. Is this a broad invitation – the entire church, school, or town? Or are you focusing on a particular group – church members who have made large donations, a grade or class at school, or people involved with your project? Knowing your audience will also help you decide where to hold your event and what type of food and entertainment to choose.",
                "Word of mouth. For schools and churches, this is the easiest and most effective means of advertisement, since you have your members / students in front of you at least once a week. Tell them about the upcoming fundraiser and why it is important. Try to tell a compelling story. That’s the best way to get people to spread the word.\n\n\nFraming your event as a story will best capture attention. Start with the need you are addressing and a concrete example of it before moving onto the even itself. For example: Last week the kids’ art projects all got wet when the roof leaked; we’re holding a fundraising dinner to raise money for a new roof. It will be great!\nFor churches, be sure to mention the fundraiser in sermons, at bible studies, and other church events in the weeks leading up to it.\nFor schools, discuss the fundraiser at school meetings and PTA meetings. Also send informational fliers for parents home with children.\nFor non-profits, be sure to mention the fundraiser whenever you can, Every conversation, especially with potential donors, is a chance to hype your event.",
                "Use direct mail and email. Lower budget fundraisers might want to stick with email to save money. For more expensive fundraisers, send well-produced mailings. A series of mailings or emails in the months leading up to the event works best.\n\n[12]",
                "Post flyers and posters in neighborhood stores and public spaces. A simple flyer will suffice to get the word out. When posting, be sure to talk about your event to store owners. Word of mouth can be even more powerful than your flyer.[13]\n\nCoffee shops often have boards where you can post fliers.\nLocal retail stores will often let you put fliers in their window.\nIf a church or school, be sure to post fliers on the grounds in multiple places where people will see them.",
                "Use social media and the internet. Adults in the U.S. spend an average of 42 minutes a day on Facebook, 34 on Tumblr, 21 on Instagram and Pinterest, and 17 on Twitter.[14] If you want to reach people, you need to be online, too.\n\n\nCreate a Facebook page. You can give updates, post pictures of the venue, and run contests that get people engaged (most clever post, best fundraiser themed picture, etc.).[15] At the very least, use the Event app on Facebook to create a page for your event and invite friends who might be interested.[16]\n\nStart a blog. It takes time and effort, but a blog is a great way to tell people the story of your event and what you are trying to accomplish, as well as getting them excited for the big night. Consider farming out blog duties to a number of people, each writing an article a day.[17]\n\nTweet. Twitter has a smaller reach than Facebook, but can be useful, particularly for driving people to your blog or Facebook page.\nBuy ads. Look for local websites that offer inexpensive banner ads, or consider targeted advertising on Facebook. For higher impact, use your ads to direct people to your blog.[18]",
                "Advertise in local papers and magazines. Particularly for neighborhood events, an ad in the local paper can be very effective. Be sure to include the basics: who, what, when, where, and why.[19]",
                "Make a YouTube video. It does not have to be a work of art. A couple of people talking about how important your cause is, or a few pictures with voice over, is enough. Link to the video from your Facebook page or send a link in one of your email announcements.",
                "Send a news release to local media. Let newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and magazines know that you are hosting an event and that you would like coverage. Provide lots of information so the event is easy for them to write up. Even small events can often get an article in the local newspaper. Larger, more expensive events might attract more coverage.[20]",
                "Make a plan. You should have a schedule of events, and all staff or volunteers should know where they need to be during the event and the flow of activities. Be sure you have also discussed timing with any vendors.[21] You’ll want to include things like:\n\n\nWhen vendors and volunteers need to arrive to set up.\nWhen volunteers will meet before the event to discuss and rehearse as needed.\nWhen guests will arrive and how they will be greeted, guided into the event.\nWhen entertainment or additional activities like auctions will start.\nWhen food service will start.\nWhen and how food clean-up will begin.\nWhen the event will end.\nWho will stay for clean up and break down.",
                "Have a person assigned to troubleshooting. Not everything will go perfectly. If you are at a high-level fundraiser and are trying to speak with important guests, you don’t want to have to be troubleshooting at the same time. Local fundraisers can also be harrowing if everyone is worrying about last minute details. Assigning someone this task will make everyone else’s life easier.",
                "Arrive early to set things up. If you are preparing your own food or providing your own entertainment, you’ll need to arrive several hours early to start cooking and setting up. If you are catering and hiring entertainment, your event organizers will still need to arrive early in the day to make sure that the space is open and vendors are arriving and setting up as promised.",
                "Check that everything is in order. Before guests arrive, you’ll want to go through a series of checks to make sure everything is running smoothly. Check:[22]\n\nThe sound system.\nThe lights.\nThe décor.\nThe number or chairs.\nThe silverware / flatware.\nThe readiness of performers and food.",
                "Help the guest park. You should work out where guests will park in advance. Have people on the street ready to direct traffic. For events at rented spaces, it is nice to have valet parking available.",
                "Greet the guests. Have people posted outside to direct people in. For events during the winter, a coat check or a place to hang jackets is important. You will of course also need people at the entrance to greet guests, take their tickets, and distribute a program if there is one.\n\n\nA program not only informs guests about the order of events, it is also a great opportunity to reinforce your fundraising message by including information about your cause.",
                "Work the room. You will want to be sure to take advantage of the opportunity to talk to attendees about your cause and projects. While the dinner’s goal is to make money, it is also an opportunity to cultivate donors. Be friendly and introduce guests to one another, but don’t be afraid to also specifically ask for commitments to annual pledges or special projects.[23]",
                "Stay on time. This is imperative. Having your dinner drag on too long is a sure way to lose your guests' interest. Someone should be tasked with the job of keeping the dinner running on time. That means you need to start on time, hit your marks during the night, and end on time.[24]",
                "Send thank you letters. Your efforts are not over when the dinner ends. It is important to continue to cultivate donors and volunteers so that they will be willing to give more time and money in the future. Be sure to send thank you notes to all contributors, volunteers, and vendors.[25]",
                "Let people know how great the event was. The best way to have a great fundraiser is to make it an annual thing, so that word of mouth has time to spread. Start getting ready for next years fundraiser right away by reminding everyone how great this year’s was. Post event photos to Facebook, twitter, or instagram. Contact local media to let them know how successful the fundraiser was.[26]",
                "Do a post-dinner autopsy. If you want next year’s event to be even better, you need to learn from this one. The event leaders should meet in the week after the event to discuss what worked and what could have worked better. This is especially important for organizations like schools, which may not have the same volunteers from year to year. Writing down what you have learned can create institutional knowledge you can pass on to the next bunch of parents."

        "wikiHow to Repair Car Paint Chips": {
            "intro": "Chipped paint on your car can be more than an eye sore. Exposed metal can lead to rust, which can spread beneath the paint and ruin entire pieces of the body of your car. Even a small chip in your paint caused by a tiny pebble can lead to big headaches if you don’t repair it properly. Fortunately, most chips can be repaired at home with minimal tools and experience. You may not be able to return the car to a showroom finish, but you can prevent rust from developing and even repair the chip well enough that most people may never notice.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine the severity of the chip. Chips in the paint of your car can be classified into one of three categories: small, medium and large. Small chips tend to be smaller than a dime and require less work to address. Medium chips are larger than a dime, but smaller than a quarter and large chips include chips in your paint that are as large or even larger than a quarter. Other things that can make a chip more difficult to repair include rust and flaking paint.[1]\n\nSmall chips should be free of rust and smaller than a dime.\nFlaking paint requires the removal of the loose paint, which will make it larger than a “small chip” for repair purposes.",
                "Purchase a touch up paint pen. Unlike scratches, which can often be buffed or wet sanded out, a chip in your paint will require that you apply new paint to the metal. The paint on your car does more than simply make it look good, it also protects the metal beneath it from the elements. If the metal is exposed to air and moisture for too long, it will begin to oxidize and rust. Using touch up paint can help you prevent rust and with the wide variety of options available, it should be easy to find one that matches your car exactly. Touch up pens are designed specifically for small chips and can be very easy to use.[2]\n\nCheck on the sticker inside the door of all vehicles made after 1983 for a paint code. If the code for paint is not clearly labeled, take a picture of the sticker to show the clerk at your local auto parts store so they can find the code.\nSome stores may ask for the Vehicle Identification Number (or VIN) for your vehicle to ensure they can find an exact match for your paint. Your VIN can also be found on the sticker inside your door.",
                "Clean the area around the chip. Before you can do any painting, it’s important that you wash the area thoroughly. Painting over things like dirt can ruin the appearance of the final product and it may fall off, revealing the chip once again. Rinse the area of the car, then wash it with warm soap and water before rinsing it again and then drying it well.[3]\n\nMake sure the car is completely dry before applying any paint.",
                "Use the paint pen to fill the chip. Once the car is completely dry, remove the cap of the paint pen and place the point of the pen in the center of the chip. Depending on the type of paint pen you are using, you may need to press the pen down slightly to release the paint. You may not need to move the pen to fill a small chip, as the paint will be released and should fill the space needed, but move the pen from side to side a bit if you need to release more. Use enough paint to over-fill the chip slightly, as the paint will shrink a little as it dries.[4]\n\nDo not apply enough paint to allow it to drip. The paint color will match, but things like drips will stand out.\nIf you accidentally apply too much paint, wipe off the excess immediately and thoroughly.",
                "Allow the paint to dry then wash and wax the car. Make sure the paint dries completely before washing the car, as you can easily scrape or damage the new paint while it is still tacky. Depending on the type of paint pen and how much paint you used, it may take only an hour or so to dry completely, but may require as much as a full day. Once the paint is completely dry, wash the entire car and then apply a fresh coat of wax.[5]\n\nTouch the paint lightly to determine if it is dry. If it feels sticky at all, it isn’t dry yet.\nApplying a new coat of wax will help make the car’s paint appear uniform in color and glossiness, as well as helping to protect the paint from further chips.",
                "Remove any debris. Medium sized chips tend to be between the size of a dime and a quarter. Because of their increased size, it isn’t uncommon for small amounts of debris to get stuck in the chip or to the paint on the borders of the chip. Remove small debris with your fingers or a pair of tweezers before washing the area of the vehicle. If you attempt to wash it first, the sponge could catch small bits of debris and drag it through the rest of the good paint, causing small scratches.[6]\n\nUsing tweezers can help you to get small bits of debris that may be caught in the paint before you move on to washing the vehicle.\nSometimes blowing on the area or using canned air can free up and dispel small bits of debris.\nEnsure none of the paint is flaking off as you remove the debris. Flaking paint may lead to a large chip.",
                "Wash the area around the chip. Once the chip and surrounding area are free from debris, wash that part of your car just as you would for a small chip. First rinse the area, then apply warm soapy water with a sponge before rinsing it again. Ensure the car is completely dry before applying any paint.[7]\n\nWashing the area also ensures there is no debris or sediment that may get trapped by the new layers of paint.",
                "Use rubbing alcohol to remove grease and oil. Once the area around the chip is clean and dry, put some rubbing alcohol, Prepsol or enamel reducer on a rag and use that to clean the chipped area once again. This will remove any grease or oils in the area that may make it difficult for the primer to establish a strong bond to the metal. You likely won’t be able to see any oil or grease, but it does not need to be visible to compromise the painting process.[8]\n\nSimply rub the rag on the chip itself and around the edges of it.\nRemember that this will remove wax and even clear coat from the remaining paint, so avoid scrubbing the painted area. Instead simply rub the chip lightly.",
                "Apply primer to the metal. Automotive primer can be purchased at your local auto parts store as well as at many large retailers like Walmart or Target. The primer will come in a small bottle with a brush, unlike the paint pen used for smaller chips. Use the applicator brush to apply the primer to the dry, clean metal, taking care to get very little of it on the paint surrounding it. Use only enough primer to cover the unpainted area with a thin, but solid coat.[9]\n\nWhile you will be painting over the primer, applying it to the paint around the chip will raise the height of the paint in that area, creating a blemish in the paint you will be able to see.\nEnsure you don’t use more primer than is necessary. Immediately wipe off and thoroughly clean any drips.\nMake sure the primer dries completely before moving on to the next step. If it feels sticky, it isn’t dry yet.",
                "Apply touch up paint by dabbing the applicator brush. Medium and large sized chips require touch up paint that has an applicator brush instead of the pen. While the paint is the same, the method used to apply it is slightly different. For medium sized chips on the smaller side, a paint pen may still do the trick. Shake the touch up paint thoroughly, then dip just the tip of the applicator brush into it. Dab the applicator brush in the center of the chip and move it around slightly, allowing the paint to stick to the metal and expand. Dip the brush in again, then touch it to the paint in the same area, allowing the paint to flow off of the applicator brush and settle on the vehicle, instead of stroking it on as you might when painting a house.[10]\n\nIt may take a number of dabs to fill the chip, but doing it in this manner allows the paint to settle evenly.\nFight the urge to apply more paint to expedite the process. Adding too much paint at a time can result in dripping or bubbling.",
                "Allow the paint to dry and re-apply if necessary. Once the touch up paint has dried, evaluate the result. If the paint has sufficiently filled the chip and the sides of the touch up paint have become flush with the surrounding paint, you are ready to move on to the next step. If the touch up paint settles slightly lower than the surrounding paint or some metal is still visible, apply another coat of paint by dabbing it on the chip just as you did previously.[11]\n\nThe paint may look raised above the surrounding dry paint as you dab it. It will shrink as it dries, allowing it to flatten out.\nPatience during this process will ensure you end up with the best possible final product.\nEnsure the touch up paint is completely dry before moving on to the next step (it may take a number of hours).",
                "Wash and wax the vehicle. Although you only painted one small portion of the vehicle, it’s important to wax the entire vehicle at the same time to ensure the glossiness of the paint matches throughout. Wax protects your paint from the elements and from sun-caused fading, so failing to apply new wax to the entire car could result in the paint fading into slightly different shades. You will need to apply wax to the newly painted area in order to protect the new paint as well as to make the glossiness of it match the rest of the car.[12]\n\nMake sure to wash and wax your entire car to protect the paint and ensure the levels of glossiness match.",
                "Assess the damage. A large paint chip is usually the size of a quarter or even larger. Large chips can be the most difficult to repair because the area that you will need to repaint will be more visible. If the chip reaches a few inches in diameter or continues to flake into a larger and larger chip, you will probably need a body shop to repaint the entire body component or even the whole car. Make sure the paint damage is something you can handle with touch up paint before beginning.[13]\n\nTouch up paint should only be used on chips in your paint that are smaller than a few inches in diameter.\nDo not attempt to apply paint over existing paint that is chipping, as it will flake off and ruin the repair.",
                "Use tweezers or a dental pick to remove debris and chips. Larger chips are more apt to accumulate debris that you must remove before moving on to the next step. Use your fingers or tweezers to remove any large debris and try blowing on the area or using canned air to remove any sediment. Large chips may result in the surrounding paint flaking. Make sure to remove the paint that flakes, as it is no longer bonded to the metal and will eventually come off anyway – taking your new touch up paint with it. You can use your fingernails, tweezers or a dental pick to remove flakes.[14]\n\nBe careful not to remove any good paint from the area surrounding the chip when removing flakes.\nMake sure you don’t scratch the good paint with any tools you are using to remove flakes or debris.",
                "Remove any surface rust. Because large chips expose more metal to moisture, there is an increased risk of rust. Remove rust by applying some CLR to a Q-tip and swabbing the metal. If the rust has penetrated deep enough to create a hole through the door or your Q-Tip penetrates the metal, it means the rust has ruined the body component and cannot be repaired by simply painting over it. A body shop can determine if rust of that magnitude can be removed and repaired or if you will need to replace that component of the body of the car. If there is no deep penetration of rust, simply apply the CLR with different Q-tips until they start coming up clean.[15]\n\nOnce the Q-tips start coming up clean, wipe the area you applied the CLR to with rubbing alcohol to remove the chemical and any grease or oil that may remain.\nFailing to completely remove the rust will result in the new paint you apply flaking off with bits of rust.\nStopping the progress of rust can prevent you from having to pay for expensive repairs to the body of your car in the future.",
                "Sand the edges of the chip. Use fine grit sandpaper (2000 grit should suffice without causing further scratches) to round off the edges of the paint around the chip to reduce visibility of the repair. Hard defined paint edges surrounding a large chip can make the repair obvious to the naked eye, but by rounding off the edges you can help the new paint blend with the old more effectively. Do not wet the sandpaper as you might when wet-sanding automotive paint, as this can cause rust to begin to form on the bare metal. Instead use dry sandpaper and replace it often as the paper becomes clogged with paint.[16]\n\nGluing pieces of sand paper to small craft sticks or dowels can help you to control the angle in which you sand, but it is not necessary to complete this step.\nSand the edges of the chip until they are rounded off and less distinct to the naked eye.\nWash the area after sanding it to remove any new sediment.",
                "Apply the primer. Once the chip is sanded, clean and dry you can apply the primer just like you would on a medium sized chip. Apply a thin layer of primer to any bare metal using the applicator brush. Be careful not to apply so much primer that drips begin to form, as they could reach the paint or cause the final repair to look uneven.[17]\n\nAllow the primer to dry completely before moving on to the next stage.\nIt may take several hours for the primer to dry to full “cure.” Read the label on the automotive primer you purchased to know for sure.",
                "Wet sand the primer. Once the primer is dry, it may appear to be textured due to the bristles of the brush or the way it settled on the metal. Use 2000 grit sandpaper and a hose to wet sand the primer. Turn the house on and hold it above the chip so the water is pouring directly onto the dry primer, then use the sand paper to lightly sand only the primer. Be careful not to sand the clear coat or paint from the surrounding area as you lightly sand the primer until it is completely flat.[18]\n\nWet sanding the primer will help ensure it takes on a completely flat and even finish.\nAllow the sanded primer to dry again completely before moving on to the next step.",
                "Apply the touch up paint to the primer. Using the same method as you might for a medium sized chip, apply the touch up paint to the primer. Dab the applicator brush in the paint, then touch it to the center of the chip and allow the paint to settle evenly. Repeat this process until the paint covers the entire primed area. You may need to apply multiple coats, or one coat could suffice depending on the touch up paint you purchase.[19]\n\nAllow the paint to dry completely before determining if you should apply another coat.\nIf you attempt to apply the paint before the primer has dried from the wet sanding, grey swirls could appear in the paint.",
                "Wet sand the newly dried paint. Once the paint is completely dry, repeat the wet sanding process on the fresh paint to remove any texture and make it completely flat. Make sure to use different extremely fine sandpaper (2000 grit or more) and keep the water flowing over the paint as you sand it to prevent doing damage to the newly repaired area. Dry sanding will result in scratches in the paint.[20]\n\nIf you make a mistake or identify an issue with the paint during the wet sanding, allow it to dry completely and then apply more touch up paint.\nSand the area lightly until it is completely flat and even with the surrounding area.",
                "Apply clear coat. Some touch up paint will come with a small container of clear coat, but you may need to purchase it separately. Clear coat is lacquer based and should be applied in a thin coat over the fresh paint using the supplied brush applicator. A small, fine bristled paint brush will also suffice. Apply the clear coat to the new paint; this will both protect the paint and provide a healthy shine that you will further blend with the surrounding paint with wax in the following step.[21]\n\nApply the clear coat by painting a thin layer of it to the new paint.\nThe freshly painted chip may still be slightly visible to you as you complete the clear coat, but remember that it will be difficult to see if you aren’t too close.\nAllow the clear coat to dry completely before moving on.",
                "Wash and wax the entire car. Once the repaired area is completely dry, wash and wax the entire car to ensure the wax is evenly distributed. Waxing the car will further blend the freshly painted area with the surrounding paint and make the repair even less noticeable. You may want to wait a few days before waxing to ensure the repaired layers of clear coat, paint, and primer are all completely dry so you don’t run any risk of damaging the new paint in the process.[22]\n\nYou may want to repair any other chips you intend to fix before waxing the vehicle."

If you want the top of the Workbench to be flush with the frame underneath it (which you will be building in Steps 8 and 9), each brace should be equal to the width of the bench top minus the width of two 2x4s; however, if you’d like the frame to jut slightly out from underneath the bench top, which can be useful for storing clamps, for example, cut the braces to same length as the width of the bench top.\n\nSince 2x4s aren’t actually 2 x 4 inches and can sometimes even vary in thickness, measure the (skinny) width of your 2x4s for a precise cut.",
                "Position each top leg brace on a pair of legs. Lay down two of the 4x4s perfectly parallel to one other so that the distance from the outside left edge to the outside right edge equals the length of the brace. Lay one leg brace across them so that it is flush with both the sides and (what will eventually be) the tops of the legs. Repeat on the other leg pair.",
                "Bolt each top leg brace to a pair of legs. Using a 3/8-inch (10-mm) drill bit, drill two holes clear through both the 2x4 and the 4x4. Make sure to drill the holes at a diagonal from each other (i.e. one at the top left, one at the bottom right) so that you will later be able to fit a third bolt into the space between. Moving from the 2x4 to the 4x4, slide bolts through the pre-drilled holes. Close them by sliding washers over the ends and holding them in place with nuts, which you can tighten with a wrench. When you’re done, the bolt ends should stick out of the 4x4s. Repeat on the remaining leg pair.",
                "Bolt the bottom two leg braces to the legs. Flip one of the leg pairs over and repeat the process you followed in Steps 7 and 8 with another brace; however, instead of lining the brace up with (what will eventually be) the bottoms of the legs, raise them a few inches so that they won’t sit flush with the floor. When you’re done, you will have a top brace at the top of one side of each leg pair and a bottom brace near the bottom of the other side of each leg pair.\n\nIf you would like to build a low shelf across the bottom braces, position them accordingly provided that they do not rise above 1/3 of the height of the legs; the lower the braces, the more stable the bench will be.",

                "Bolt the top supports into place. Lay the leg pairs down with the top braces facing outwards (i.e. away from one another) so that the distance from the outside left edge to the outside right edge equals the length of the top support. Place one of the top supports across the leg pairs so that it lines up with the top braces. Pre-drill a hole through the top support and into the 4x4 on either side (making sure to drill between the existing bolts) and then bolt the support into place with coach bolts. Flip the structure over and repeat on the other side. When you’re done, your four legs should be surrounded by a frame at the top.",

Screw coach bolts into place to secure.\n\nIf you have a thick bench top, consider bolting from the bottom up; this will keep the bench top smooth and bolt-free. However, only do this if the bench top is thick enough that it won’t risk popping off of the bolt ends.",

        "wikiHow to Find Toads": {
            "intro": "Toads are amphibians that you can find all over the world. Toads come in many sizes.[1] They even have “warts” on their bodies.[2] You might want to catch a toad to keep it as a pet, but might find it difficult because they are often hard to find. You can find toads, though, by checking their habitats and distinguishing them from frogs.",
            "steps": [
                "Scope out typical habitats for toads. You can find toads in most parts of the world except in the South Pacific and polar regions. They are most common in tropical areas.[3] Toads like gardens, fields, streams, and ponds. Toads often like dark, damp places that allow them to hide. Take some time to look for places where you might find toads including:[4]\n\nBerry patches\nWindow wells\nTrees[5]\n\nUnder leaves\nSand\nLawns[6]\n\nGardens\nPools of water such as ponds, streams, lakes, and reservoirs\nForests\nMeadows\nUnder rocks and logs",
                "Check places where toads may find food. Toads eat a variety of foods including insects, worms, and snails.[7] Looking for toads in the places where their food sources are may help you find them more easily.\n\n\nLook for worms in rich, soft soil. Rain causes worms to come to the surface and this may be an optimal time to check for them—and toads. You may also want to check for worms and toads under old boards, bricks, logs, or debris where the soil is moist.[8]\n\nFind snails in shaded areas, when it is cloudy outside, or at night. Make sure you look for snails and the toads that like to eat them in cooler areas.[9]",
                "Search during active times of the day. Toads are mostly nocturnal. They also prefer darker spaces to rest in during the day. Looking for toads when they are most active during the day may help you more successfully find and capture them.[10]\n\nCheck for toads in the late afternoon, early evening, and nighttime. You may also find them if you search in the early morning.\nLook for toads under things such as leaves, logs, and rocks if you search for them during the day.",
                "Keep the time of year in mind. Toads, like many amphibians, may hibernate during the winter. Though not all species of toad hibernate, most will burrow below the frost line in the winter. Searching for toads according to the time of year can make you more successful in your hunt.[11]\n\nLook for toads in the forest and woodlands, grasslands, yards and gardens during the summer.\nCheck below the frost line during the winter and early spring. You may also find toads at the bottom of lakes, concealed in logs, or tucked into leaf piles.[12] You may even be able to find some toads swimming under ice in the winter.",
                "Attract toads to your yard or garden. If you prefer to not go on a large expedition to find toads, you can easily find them in your yard or garden. Setting up your yard or garden with water features and places to hide can attract toads that you can then catch.[13]\n\nAdd a small water feature to your yard. You could have a pond or small fountain. Make sure to not use any chemicals in the water feature because they may harm toads.\nSet up a toad abode or adobes where toads can hide, preferably near a shady place or water source. You can easily create an abode yourself by turning a ceramic flower pot upside down. If it doesn’t have a crack or hole in the side, prop it up with a rock to let the toad get in and out. The abode doesn’t need a bottom because toads like to dig. You can also make an abode out of a pile of rocks.[14]\n\nPlant perennials with large leaves such as Bergenia or Ligularia. Make sure to not use chemical pesticides in your yard or garden as this can harm toads and decrease their food supply.",
                "Contact your local county extension. If you are having trouble finding toads or attracting them to your yard, call or visit your local county extension. The county extension can provide you information on the types of toads in your local area and where you might find them. The county extension can also suggest what to plant and how to fertilize your garden without chemical pesticides that may deter or harm toads.[15]\n\nLocate your local county extension at http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm.",
                "Figure out why you are catching the toad. People have different reasons for wanting to catch toads. It might be to keep them as pets for life or it might even be to get rid of invasive or poisonous species such as Bufo toads.[16] Knowing your reasons for catching a toad can ensure that you treat toads in the most humane way. Ask yourself the following questions:\n\n\nAm I willing to support a healthy environment for toads to help get rid of insects in my yard?\nCan I commit to taking care of my toad for its life, knowing that it could be up to 15 years? Can I afford the supplies and food?[17]\n\nAm I prepared to humanely euthanize invasive toads on my property? Is this better left to a professional?[18]",
                "Get materials for a trap. You can easily trap toads on your property or in other wilderness areas. Having your materials ready can help you quickly build your trap and look for toads. Get the following items:\n\n\n24 ft. of 18-inch wide aluminum window screening or 15 ft. of 28-inch wide screening\n15 ft. of 36-inch wide fiberglass screening\n25 ft. of string or small rope to make handles\nUtility knife and scissors\nStapler with 1000 staples[19]\n\nSmall fish net or other container if you prefer to catch toads with your hands[20]\n\nGlow stick or outdoor light, that can attract insects toads like to eat. A 12 volt black light insect tube may be the most effective at attracting insects.[21]",
                "Build your trap. You can purchase traps for amphibians, including toads. But they might not work as well as a trap you make. Using your materials, build the trap(s) and place where toads live.[22]\n\nCut the aluminum window or fiberglass screening in a large rectangle. Then roll it into a cylinder that is 18” x 8” around. Make a 1” lip at the top by rolling the 18” end toward the other end. Staple the lip where it meets the cylinder screening. This will keep the cylinder and lip together. Staple every ½” to hold the cylinders together.\nPlace the light or glow stick at one end of the of the cylinder and cover it with shade cloth or plastic. Leave the other end open for toads to enter the trap.[23]",
                "Place the traps near bodies of water. The most effective place to put your traps is near a body of water. If it is winter, when some toads hibernate, then place the traps near refuges such as plant beds.[24]\n\nPlace the trap near non-flowing, water source like a swamp, pond, or vernal pool in the summer and spring.[25]\n\nPut the trap near burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer.",
                "Monitor the traps. Check to see if you’ve trapped any toads within 24 hours of setting the traps. If you didn’t catch any toads, keep checking the trap until you find a toad in it.[26]\n\nUse a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to transfer your toad to its new home.\nRelease other animals in the trap back into the wild.",
                "Net a toad. You may want to actively catch a toad using a net instead of traps. Look for the toads in the same places that you would place traps. Take a light or glow stick to attract the insects that toads eat.[27]\n\nPut on a pair of waterproof shoes or boots so that you can walk through mud or water.\nSweep the net through the water, hoop first, through the water when you see a toad you’d like to catch. You’ll have to be quick so that you don’t miss it.",
                "Avoid touching irritant secretions. There are many myths about toads giving humans warts by touching their skin. You can’t get warts by touching the skin of toads, but you may expose yourself to other irritants. Many toads have a so-called bufotoxin on their skin, which can cause other small animals death and irritation to human skin. If you’re going to catch the toad you found, use a net or a pair of gloves so that you minimize the risk of skin irritation with a bufotoxin.[28]",
                "Identify the basic characteristics of toads. You’ve located a spot to find toads and considered your motives, and now you’re ready to get your toad. It’s a good idea to know what traits identify toads. Some typical characteristics of toads are:\n\n\nDry, warty skin[29]\n\nBumps on their heads\nStubby bodies[30]\n\nStubby hind legs\nSwellings behind the eyes, which are the parotid glands\nBrown or grayish color\nJewel-like eyes\nSlightly-webbed toes\nNo teeth, unlike frogs",
                "Observe different species of toads. Most toads have the same basic characteristics. However, there are 300 different species of toads across the globe. They can vary in size and color. Figuring out what species may be in your area can help you locate toads and even find unusual species.[31]\n\nCheck with your local or national wildlife agency for toad species that you can find near you. For example, if you live in Western Europe, you might find the common midwife toad.[32] If you’re in Madagascar, you might find the rare red Dyscophus antongilii.[33] People in the Americas may find giant or cane toads.[34] You can also find these in Australia.[35]",
                "Distinguish toads from frogs. You might spot a toad that doesn’t match any basic characteristics. You may have found a frog instead. All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. This can be confusing! Ask yourself the following questions if you are unsure if you found a toad or a frog:[36]\n\nWhere does the toad live? Frogs and toads live in similar places, but frogs may live in trees. You won’t find any toads climbing trees.\nIs my toad chubby or slim? Toads are chubbier than their frog cousins. They have shorter back legs, which are good for hopping on the ground, or walking and crawling. Toads may be slightly slower and less active than leaping frogs.\nWhat do my toad’s feet look like? A toad won’t have webbed feet or sticky pads on its toes. Frogs have webbed hind find and some may have webbed front feet. Some frogs have pads on their toes to help them climb trees.\nWhat does my toad’s skin look like? Frogs have smooth and moist skin. Toads have drier skin that feels rough and has warts."

        "wikiHow to Speak Clearly": {
            "intro": "Speaking clearly and effectively can make it much easier to communicate ideas accurately. You'll need to slow down your speech, enunciate each syllable, and practice your diction. Take the time to practice speaking, and correct yourself if you mess up.",
            "steps": [
                "Take a deep breath. Calm yourself down before you start speaking, so that your lungs won't run out of air. Distill your thoughts – do not spill them. If you dive into speech without taking time to ground yourself, you may speak more quickly and slur your words. Take the time to center yourself, and proceed mindfully from there.",
                "Articulate your words. Pronounce each syllable individually. Syll - a - ble. Take it very slowly, at first, until each sound is clear and distinct. Gradually speed up your speech and decrease the space between words until you are speaking normally.[1]\n\nMake sure you actually stop the air for consonants like 't' and 'b'. Differentiate between your vowels.\nDon't expect to speak with perfect clarity right away. You may need to practice this for several hours each day, and you may need to practice more to master difficult words.\nPractice when you're alone – in the car, or walking down the street; when cleaning, or knitting, or standing in front of the mirror. You can slow down your syllables in conversation, but you may make more progress if you devote some serious time to honing your speech.",
                "Speak more slowly. It can be incredibly helpful to give your words an extra second or two to fully come out of your mouth. Pausing also works, because pausing allows the person you're speaking to, to digest all of the words you've just said.[2]",
                "Practice your grammar. If you use poor grammar, your thoughts and ideas may not come across as clearly as you'd like. Speak as though you're composing an essay or a letter: with patience, poise, and precision.\n\n\nAvoid speaking in run-on sentences. If you let yourself ramble, your listeners might miss the point. Try to break up your thoughts into comprehensible chunks.[3]",
                "Expand your vocabulary. One apt word can be much clearer than a flurry of circumlocution. Try to find exactly the word you need – then use it effectively. Be careful not to use words incorrectly or out of context; you may obscure the clarity of what you're trying to say, and you will not be taken seriously.\n\n\nThe caveat: you'll need to make sure that the people you're speaking to also know these words. Keep audience in mind. Use simpler words, when possible.\nReading is a great way to expand vocabulary. Read books, articles, essays; read things that fascinate you, and read things that you wouldn't normally read. Whenever you come across a word that you don't know, look it up.\nTry keeping a list of useful, powerful words. The more you use them in context, the more natural it will feel – and the better your word-selection may become.",
                "Think before you speak. If you prepare your words, you may run less risk of slipping up. Even if you don't plan out the exact words that you're going to say, you can take a moment to think through your ideas and clarify them in your mind.\n\n\nSilently say the words to yourself before you say them aloud. This might help you ensure that you've gotten the pronunciation right.",
                "Speak with inflection. Questions should ascend in pitch at the end. Statements should inflect somewhat deeper, with finality. Notice which syllables and words get emphasis. Try exaggerating your inflection, the way you would if you were reading a story to a small child.[4]",
                "Practice saying tongue twisters. If you work on phrases that are difficult to pronounce, you may find it easier to speak clearly in everyday conversation. Start slowly, and gradually work your way up to a normal pace. Identify problem syllables: if you notice that you have trouble enunciating your \"B\" sounds, try saying tongue twisters that play on the \"B\" syllable.[5]\n\nFor \"B\" words, try: Bill had a billboard. Bill also had a board bill. The board bill bored Bill, so Bill sold his billboard and paid his board bill. Then the board bill no longer bored Bill, but though he had no board bill, neither did he have his billboard!\n\nFor \"D\" words, try: Did Doug dig David's garden or did David dig Doug's garden? or Do drop in at the Dewdrop Inn.\n\nFor \"F\" sounds, try: Four furious friends fought for the phone or Five flippant Frenchmen fly from France for fashions.\n\nFor \"J\" sounds, try: James just jostled Jean gently or Jack the jailbird jacked a jeep.",
                "Repeat the phrases over and over. Start very slowly and clearly, enunciating each syllable: \"Five flipp-ant French-men fly from France for fash-ions.\" Get faster and faster while maintaining clarity. If you trip over words, stop and start again. With determined practice, you may learn to conquer difficult syllables.",
                "Be confident in your speech. Don't be afraid to speak loudly and clearly. Reciting anything that someone else has written—poems, books, tongue twisters—is great for practicing confidence. Follow through with your words: finish as strong as you start! Be sure of what you intend to say, and the meaning will shine through.\n\n\nIf you tend to mumble or slur your words, it can be difficult to break from the pattern and speak clearly. When you recite words, try to forget about the fact that you are speaking. Focus only on the words, their meaning, their beauty. Try not to overthink it.[6]"

        "How to Remove Musty Smell from Clothes": {
            "intro": "If your clothes smell musty, chances are they are infested with spores of a mold. This can happen if you leave them too long in the storage or let them sit for a few days in the washing machine. You can get rid of the smell using handy household products like vinegar, baking soda or borax. After washing your clothes, dry them outside in the sun to completely get rid of the smell.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a household product to use. Clothes with a mild musty smell can often be treated using a common, nontoxic household product. This method is also best for delicate fabrics that can't be bleached. If your clothes have mold spores, they won't stop smelling musty until the spores have been killed. Check around your house to see which of the following mold killing products you have on hand:\n\n\nWhite vinegar\nBorax\nBaking soda",
                "Start a load of wash. Put the musty clothes in your washing machine with the amount of detergent you normally use. Let the washer fill with water as the cycle begins. Allow it to completely fill before continuing.\n\n\nIt's best to use hot water to ensure the mold spores get killed.\nIf you're washing clothing that can't be washed in hot water, try using cold water instead. You may have to wash the clothes more than once to get rid of the smell.",
                "Pour a cup of your chosen product into the water. Once the washer has filled with water, pour in a cup of vinegar, borax or baking soda. Pour it straight into the water so it will get evenly dispersed. Finish running the wash cycle as usual.\n\n\nEach of these items has properties that help to kill mold spores and remove bad smells. If the clothes are particularly musty, you can use baking soda and vinegar together.\nIf you aren't able to pour the product straight into the water, mix it with a cup of hot water and use the liquid detergent dispenser.",
                "Hang the clothes outside to dry. Drying your clothes on a line in the sun will help to kill any remaining spores and freshen the smell of the clothing. Even during the winter, you can dry your clothes outside on a sunny day. Try to place them in an area that gets full sun and wind.\n\n\nIf it's raining outside, you'll need to use your dryer instead. This isn't ideal, since the dryer is an enclosed space that doesn't allow fresh air to flow through your clothes.\nIf your clothes come out of the dryer still smelling musty, wait for a sunny day to wash them and dry them outside.",
                "Try a no-rinse cleaner. If you need to get the smell out of a coat or another clothing item that's dry clean only, submerging it in water isn't an option. No rinse cleaner effectively rinses the surface of an item without completely saturating the layers of fabric, so there's less chance of warping. Look in the laundry products section for a \"no-rinse wash.\" It's a concentrated solution that comes in bottles, similar to detergent.\n\n\nIn most cases you'll mix a capful of the no-rinse wash with several liters of water. Pour it into a spray bottle.\nSpray your musty garment so that all parts of it are slightly damp.\nHang the garment to dry outside in the sun and wind. When it dries, the smell should be gone. If it still smells musty, repeat the process.\nNote that this does require wetting the fabric. Don't use this method on items that shouldn't get wet, like leather or suede.",
                "Use baking soda. Instead of washing your clothes with baking soda, you can use dry baking soda on your dry clean only garments. Baking soda will absorb the musty smell. You may have to repeat the process more than once for best results.\n\n\nLay the garment on a clean surface. Sprinkle it all over with a fine layer of baking soda. Turn it over and do the same. If you don't wish to put baking soda directly on the item try placing the item in a plastic bag next to an open container of baking soda.\nLet the baking soda sit on the garment overnight.\nTake it outside and shake it well. Use a soft brush to remove excess baking soda.\nHang it outside for the rest of the day.",
                "Try spraying your garment with vodka. If you don't want to go to the expense of getting a special cleaner, you cause use cheap vodka. Pour some vodka into a spray bottle. Spray the musty item all over, making sure you don't miss a spot. Hang it outside in the sun to dry. This should remove or weaken the musty smell.",
                "Get it dry cleaned. If no at-home methods successfully remove the musty smell, you may need to take the item to a dry cleaner store. Dry cleaners use powerful chemicals to deodorize fabric, and in most cases they can effectively get rid of mustiness. If you're not interested in having your clothing coated with chemicals, look for a \"green\" dry cleaning store that uses liquid carbon dioxide cleaning.[1]",
                "Place the clothes in boiling water. If your items are extremely moldy and you don't want to throw them away, you can try putting them in boiling water to kill the mold spores and remove that musty smell. This method should only be used on items like towels, sheets, and other sturdy linens that can stand up to boiling water. If you place delicate fabrics in boiling water, they will probably fall apart. To boil moldy items,\n\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. You need enough water to thoroughly saturate the garment you're treating.\nPlace the garment in a separate large pot. Pour the boiling water over it, making sure it gets fully soaked.\nLet it sit for five minutes.\nWring out the water. If it's still very hot, you may want to wear rubber gloves.\nWash the garment as usual in the washer. Dry it outside in the sun.",
                "Use bleach. Bleach is an effective mold killer. It will remove mold and mustiness from items that are safe to bleach, like towels, sheets and socks. Be sure to check an item's tag before bleaching it. If it says \"Do Not Bleach,\" use a different method. Whenever you use bleach, do it in a room with plenty of ventilation, and protect your skin with gloves. To bleach your clothes,\n\n\nIn a large bucket, mix up a solution with half a cup of bleach and a gallon of water.\nPlace the musty clothes in the bleach solution.\nWash the clothes in your washing machine with detergent, as normal. Dry them outside in the sun.",
                "Try ammonia. Ammonia has a strong smell that is toxic to the lungs, so make sure your laundry room is well ventilated before using. Put your clothes in the washer and start a wash cycle without adding any detergent. Add a cup of ammonia to the water. Let the cycle run, then do a second cycle with detergent only. Hang your clothes in the sun to dry.[2]\n\nNever mix bleach with ammonia. It creates a gas that can cause lung damage if breathed.\nHandle ammonia with care. You may want to wear clothes to prevent it from getting on your skin. If you breathe in ammonia, leave the area to get fresh air. Call poison control if you feel light-headed.[3]"

[1] This article will teach you a few different meditation techniques that are proven to help people fall sleep. Try one or try them all, and find the method that works best for you!",
            "steps": [
                "Understand guided meditation. In guided meditation, you listen to an audio track of a person reading meditation instructions to you, and simply follow along with your thoughts. This is an excellent introduction to meditation for those who have never done it before and don't know where to start.",
                "Find a guided meditation track for sleeping. There are many free guided meditations for sleep available on the internet as downloadable audio files, podcasts, and YouTube videos. You can also purchase sleep meditation CDs at any major bookstore, or online.\n\n\nLook for a guided meditation CD or file that has good reviews, or comes from a reputable source, such as MIT Medical, which provides a number of audio file downloads designed to help you fall asleep. [2]\n\nIf you download a free file, it is a good idea to listen to it once before bedtime to make sure the file is intact and doesn't include any hidden surprises, like advertisements at the end.",

Adjust the volume settings beforehand.\n\n\nBe sure to set the device's sleep mode or power saver settings so that the device will turn itself off after the recording has finished.\nIt is not advisable to use headphones for a guided sleep meditation, since ideally you will fall asleep before the recording is over, and you don't want to get tangled up in the cords in the night.",
                "Get ready and start the recording. Put on your pajamas, darken the room, and get comfy in bed before you hit play. Then relax and listen, and prepare for a night of restful sleep! If you don't fall asleep after the first play-through, take a few deep breaths and begin again.",
                "Understand progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a meditation technique in which you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in your body to promote awareness of your body, and an allover state of relaxation. Progressive relaxation can be used day or night for general relaxation, but is especially helpful for promoting sleep at night. Performing the full progressive relaxation exercise should take between 10 to 15 minutes.",
                "Get comfortable. Put on your pajamas and ready for bed. Darken your room, lie down, and adjust your pillows and blankets until you are fully comfortable.",

Tense the muscles just enough to feel the tension, not so much that you feel pain. After five seconds of tension, relax the muscles you are working on. (Some people find it helpful to think or quietly say the word \"relax\" for this part.) After 10 seconds of relaxation, move on to the next muscle group, and repeat the process.\n\n\nForehead. Wrinkle your brow or raise your eyebrows up like you are surprised, then relax.\nEyes and nose. Close your eyes tightly in a squint, then relax.\nMouth, cheeks and jaw. Stretch your mouth open, as in a yawn, or make a wide grimace, then relax.\nHands. Clench your fists, then release them and relax.\nWrists and forearms. Hold your hands up like you are pushing an invisible wall and tense, then relax.\nUpper arms. Flex your biceps, then relax.\nShoulders. Raise your shoulders towards your ears in a shrug, then relax.\nBack. Arch your back gently, then relax.\nStomach. Tighten your stomach muscles like you are \"sucking it in,\" then relax.\nHips and glutes. Flex your glutes, then relax.\nThighs. Tense your thigh muscles above the knees, then relax.\nAnkles and feet. Flex your feet, raising your toes as high as you can, then relax.\nToes. Curl your toes as tightly as you can, then relax.",

                "Understand mindfulness meditation. During mindfulness meditation, you will pay focused and intentional attention to the way you are feeling, in order to relax the body and mind. [4] It is important not to judge or analyze the thoughts and feelings that pop into your head while performing mindfulness meditation, just note them and let them go by. The center of your focus should be the physical sensations you are experiencing in the present moment, as you lie in bed.[5]",

Take your time with this step and don't become concerned by the flood of thoughts that may occur, just take a few moments to observe them and let them rush by.\n\n\nThis is not the time to try to solve problems. If you feel yourself worrying about something, just observe the concern and move on. You can try to work out solutions to issues the next day, when you are well-rested and refreshed.",
                "Focus your on attention on your physical body. Begin by concentrating on the points of contact between your body and the bed. Is your weight equally distributed? Think about how your head is resting on your pillow, and how the blankets lie against your feet. Listen to any sounds you can hear, including your own breath. Observe the temperature of the room, and the way the air is circulating around your face.",
                "Think about how your body feels. Does it feel light or heavy? Are you experiencing any tension or pain? Mentally scan your body from head to toe, thinking about areas of tension, and intentionally tensing and then relaxing them, as you might do in a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Repeat the body scan process several times, if needed, to relax any tense muscles.",
                "Focus again on your breathing. Pay attention to the rhythm as you inhale and exhale. Focus on the physical sensations of breathing, and the sounds that your breath makes. If your mind starts to wander, return to the focus of the rising and falling of your chest.",
                "Review the events of the day in a structured fashion. Take a few minutes to remember and relive the way your day unfolded, from the moment you got up in the morning, to the present moment. Fast-forward through the day, observe and recollect conversations and what you did, but don't analyze or overthink.",
                "Return your focus to your body. Once your review of the day has caught up with the present, where you are lying in bed, return to the sensations of your body and your breath.",
                "Switch off your body. Beginning with the toes of your left foot, think about each part of your body for a moment, and give it permission to \"switch off\" or \"go to sleep.\" Travel from your toes, up your leg, to your waist, then repeat with the other leg. Then continue to check-in with your torso, and each arm, beginning with your finger, and working your way up to your shoulders and neck. Finish with your throat, face and head.",
                "Enjoy the feeling of relaxation, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep. With your body at rest, your mind will soon follow. Allow your thoughts to wander as they will, knowing you will wake up feeling refreshed and relaxed.\n\n\nMany people fall asleep long before this last step. If you have not, don't worry. Just remember that your body wants to sleep as much as you do, and that it will eventually happen. Just relax and try not to force it."

Muscle pain always feels better when heat is applied, and the uterus is no exception.\n\n\nLie down and lay a hot water bottle or other hot compress across your abdomen.\nYou could also apply heat by taking a warm bath or shower to ease the pain.",
                "Drink herbal tea. Drinking a warm, soothing fluid can help relax your muscles, and certain herbs are said to effectively relieve cramps. Brew up a pot of tea with one of the following herbs:\n\n\nRaspberry leaf, which is said to help relax the uterus.\nCramp bark, a powerful herb that is said to ease uterine muscle contractions.\nDong Quai, which is relaxing to the nervous system.",
                "Get a massage. Kneading the muscles in your lower back and abdomen can go a long way toward easing the pain of cramps.[1]Use a self massaging tool or have a partner work on these areas for you. If you're in the mood to splurge, hire a masseuse for a professional job.",
                "Get regular exercise. Women who incorporate regular exercise into their routines have less severe cramps than women who don't exercise.[1] Consider adding exercise to your life in one of the following ways:\n\n\nWalk or bike to work. Walking or biking can take less time than other modes of transportation, and the light exercise it entails adds up a lot over time.\nStart jogging or swimming a few times a week. Jogging and swimming keep your muscles toned and give your body a strong, healthy foundation, which helps keep cramps at bay.\nJoin a team sport. Basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball get you moving several times a week.",
                "Limit substances that make cramps worse. Have you every noticed that your cramps are more painful during periods when you're drinking a lot of coffee? That's because caffeine has an effect on the severity and duration of muscle cramps, as do alcohol and salt.[1] Limit your intake of the following substances, especially as your period approaches:\n\n\nCoffee, caffeinated tea, and soda.\nBeer, wine, liquor, and other drinks containing alcohol.\nSalty foods like chips, canned soups, and fast food.",
                "Consider taking birth control. For people with severe menstrual cramps and other menstruation-related symptoms, taking birth control can help ease the pain. The hormones in birth control cause the uterine lining to thin, resulting in fewer uterine contractions and less severe cramps. Consider the following options:\n\n\nThe birth control pill is a popular method. A pill containing a certain amount of estrogen, progesterone or both is taken each day until the end of the cycle, when the period comes.\nInjectable contraceptives contain the same hormones, and are administered in the form of a shot periodically.\nIntra-uterine devices, or IUDs, are implanted inside the cervix. The device releases estrogen and progesterone hormones.",
                "Pay attention to your symptoms. If your cramps keep you from going to school or work, or prevent you from participating in your normal daily activities, there might be a medical issue aside from menstruation causing the problem.[1] See a doctor if you experience these symptoms:\n\n\nYour cramping is so severe that you are unable to stretch out your body.\nYour cramping lasts for more than 2 days.\nThe pain from your cramping leads to nausea and vomiting.",
                "Determine whether a reproductive disorder is causing your cramps. Your doctor will conduct tests to ascertain whether your cramps are regular menstrual cramps or they are a symptom of a reproductive disorder.\n\n\nEndometriosis is a condition in which the uterine lining is present outside the uterus.[1]\n\nFibroids are small tumors that can grown on the wall of the uterus and cause pain.[1]\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease is an infection that can lead to pain and other symptoms."

        "How to Overcome Obsessive Compulsive Disorder": {
            "intro": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, is a serious psychiatric disorder that involves uncontrollable and reoccurring thoughts called obsessions in addition to unusual, repetitive behaviors known as compulsions. People with this disorder may experience problems performing at work or school. They may even have trouble getting things done because of their constant obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors. Fortunately, with the appropriate approaches, OCD can be effectively managed. Learn how to overcome your OCD.",
            "steps": [
                "Locate a qualified therapist in your area. OCD requires intensive professional treatment. If you suspect you are suffering from this disorder, you must seek out a treatment provider who has experience working with OCD patients. This person will evaluate you to confirm that you are, indeed, experiencing OCD symptoms. He or she will also determine if you are suffering from another co-existing mental illness.\n\n\nFor help finding a mental health provider in your area, you may contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Treatment Referral Helpline at 1-800-66-HELP.[1]",
                "Discuss your treatment options. Once you have a confirmed diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, you should ask your mental health provider about different treatment approaches. Like many mental disorders, OCD is best treated through with therapy, medications, or a combination of these two approaches.",
                "Find out which forms of therapy are available to you. Previously, OCD was thought to be resistant to treatment. Most recently, there are a variety of therapeutic approaches developed to treat the disorder. Talk to your therapist about which is the right choice for you.\n\n\nThe treatment options that work most effectively are Cognitive/Behavioral (CBT) and a type of CBT called Exposure/Response Prevention (ERP) therapies. These therapies are geared towards helping a person with OCD manage obsessive thoughts and also exposing him or her to distressing situations.[2]",
                "Ask your therapist if medications will help with your symptoms. If your therapist recommends medication, you will need to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss which prescription will be the right choice for you. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to patients with OCD.[3]\n\nKeep in mind that medications may take 8 to 12 weeks to demonstrate any improvements. If you are prescribed meds, don’t stop taking them too soon because you think they’re not working. Give them the appropriate amount of time.\nAlways talk to your psychiatrist before making any changes to your medication regimen. You will also need to contact your doctor to let him or her know about any side effects of the medication.",
                "Join a support group. Support groups are often led by therapists who are trained to treat OCD or by individuals who have conquered the symptoms of OCD. Participating in a group format can help you feel less alone with the disorder and even teach you helpful tips about how others manage their symptoms.\n\n\nIf your therapist cannot refer you to a local support group, check out the list available at the International OCD Foundation.[4]",
                "Accept your thoughts and move on. OCD thrives on your resistance to obsessive thoughts, as well as your negative emotional reactions to them. If you have obsessions, don't try to reason with the obsessive thoughts as this will only intensify your symptoms. OCD is full of intrusive, irrational thoughts and you cannot reason your way to serenity.",
                "Try using mindful acceptance to deal with these issues. Accept and allow your unpleasant feelings, and just observe them without judging or reacting to them. Then, focus back on the present moment and all of your sensations. If you are busy focusing in on the here and now, you won't have time to worry about the future.\nIt may be helpful to simply accept and agree the obsessive thought. Consider the possibility that your fear will come true, and try making a compromise with that possibility. For example, if you have an obsessive thought about dying from pneumonia from touching the shopping cart, the world ending tomorrow, or a meteor falling on you and your family, you could say: \"Well, those scenarios are all possible, but the odds of all these situations happening are extremely low. No matter what, I'm going to let go of what I can't control, stop worrying about these possibilities, and enjoy whatever time I have left. That way, if any of these things do happen, at least I will have had a good time and spent my last moments well. I will now let go of these thoughts and my need for absolute certainty, and I'll bring my attention to my shopping in the present moment.\" It may sound counter-intuitive and even ludicrous, but this technique is often used in therapy and works. Simply acknowledge the thought and accept whatever worst case scenario your mind has concocted and move on.[5]",
                "Establish a worry period. If your obsessive thoughts seem to consume your entire day, attend to them all at once during a specified time. Depending on how many worries you have throughout a day, choose one or two short, 10-minute windows to attend to your obsessive thoughts. This tactic helps you acknowledge obsessions without trying to suppress them.[6]\n\nChoose a time that’s sufficiently spaced from your bedtime so that you aren’t kept up each night. Throughout the day, jot down a few notes about the worries that cross your mind. Tell yourself you will think more on them during your worry period.\nWhen it’s time for your worry period, focus on all the urges and thoughts that have flooded your mind during that day. Allow yourself to obsess about them for the given time frame. Once the window closes, take a deep, calming breath and let the worries go.",
                "Prepare a list of go-to distractions. Like other forms of anxiety, you can manage your OCD symptoms by shifting your attention. When incessant obsessions and behaviors seem to be coming to a head, distract yourself by refocusing your attention.[7]\n\nIt is handy to create a list of helpful activities that may serve as distractions. For example, you might include calling a friend, taking your dog for a walk, going swimming, listening to music, or any other pastime you enjoy.\nDelay the urges for at least 15 minutes by engaging in the distraction activity. At the end of the time period, examine your thoughts and urges. If they are still strong, continue the activity so that you can delay the obsessions and compulsions for as long as possible.",
                "Expose yourself to your fears, slowly and gradually. Compulsions are often done to protect you from some fear. Before now, you may have been trying to avoid any of your fears in order to prevent the compulsive behaviors. Unfortunately, when you avoid your fears, they only grow larger in scope.[8]\n\nExpose yourself to one of your triggers. Let’s say, you are sitting on the couch watching TV and suddenly question whether you locked the door. Sit with the feeling of anxiety without giving into the urge. Resist for as long as you can. When you do give in, try to limit the repetitions of checking the door again and again. Over time, you should feel less and less anxiety when faced with that trigger.\nLike with exposure and response prevention training that you may do with your therapist, you can also systematically expose yourself to distressing situations on your own. Be sure to only do this when you have successfully practiced with your therapist and have outlined coping strategies to complete if the anxiety becomes too much.",
                "Do relaxation exercises. When you are stressed, your OCD symptoms may occur more frequently and with greater intensity. Managing stress can help you to decrease the episodes. It is best to find a few relaxation exercises that work for you and practice them daily. Therefore, when you need them in the heat of them moment you can do them easily. Common relaxation techniques for OCD may include:[9][10]\n\nDeep breathing- Sit comfortably, either erect in a chair or lying on your back on a sofa or bed. Release the air from your lungs. Now, take a slow, calming breath in through your nose for 4 counts. Hold the breath for 7 counts. Exhale through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat the process until you feel more calm.\nVisualization- Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Call to mind a place where you feel completely safe. It can be a place that you know like your childhood bedroom, or an imaginary place such as an exotic beach or a lakeside cabin. Use your senses to connect with this place. Think about how it smells, sounds, feels, or tastes to be there. Use your mind to vividly create a thorough 3-dimensional picture of this place. Activate as many senses as you can. This exercise can be carried out with your therapist, on your own, or with a guided video from YouTube.\nProgressive muscle relaxation- Sit on a sofa or lie down on a bed. Relax your muscles. Inhale and exhale deeply. Starting with your toes, clench the muscles tightly. Notice how that feels. Hold them like this for a few seconds, then release the tension. Notice how it feels to let go of that tension. Now, move up to your knees. Contract those muscles, holding them this way for several counts. Release. Move upwards until you have progressively contracted each muscle group.",
                "Get some endorphins to improve your mood. Staying physically active is not only good for your physical health, but your mental health, too. Getting just 30 minutes of exercise each day can help you develop greater mental strength to control your obsessions and compulsions. For those with anxiety such as in OCD, exercise can also help take your mind off your worries.\n\n\nExercise releases feel-good chemicals in your body called endorphins. These chemicals can relieve negative mood states and make you feel happier and more confident.[11]",
                "Sleep adequately to minimize anxiety. Sleep may seem unrelated to your OCD symptoms, but surprisingly, not getting enough sleep or having poor quality sleep can worsen anxiety. Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night while aiming for 9.\n\n\nYou can improve your sleep habits by removing caffeine from your diet, retiring and rising at the same times each day, developing a routine in which you unwind before bed, and making sure your bedroom is conducive to quality sleep.[12]",
                "Surround yourself with a positive support group. Having any sort of mental disorder can make you feel isolated from others around you. However, withdrawing from friends and family can actually make you feel worse than you already do.[13] Of course, you should not depend on anyone else to help you manage OCD, but spending time with those who love and support you can give you the confidence and accountability to be steadfast in your treatment."

Doing a little research (as well as knowing what you want cherries for) is a smart first move. Here are a few of the most popular types of cherry you should know about:\n\n\nBing cherries are arguably the best-known, archetypal cherry. They are red, and very versatile, great both for using in recipes and eating on their own.\nRainier cherries are large cherries with a yellow hue to them. When they're most ripe, they develop a more reddish colour.\nLapin cherries tend to be dark red and quite big. They're perfect for making jams with.",
                "Buy your cherries, preferably handpicked. Although there are canned and packaged options, you'll want to get cherries fresh whenever possible. Hand-picking them is the best option, as it gives you the most control over which ones to buy. Go to a local and trusted produce store, and buy a bagful.\n\n\nAs a rule, if you're getting the popular red Bing cherries, you should look for the darkest cherries of the lot. Darker cherries are riper, and have a sweeter kick to them. Lighter cherries are generally more sour, and better suited for baking rather than eating them by themselves. [3]",
                "Wash your cherries off in hot water. Giving your cherries a good wash at home will remove any remaining pesticides, making them safer to eat. This rule applies to all uncanned produce, so make sure to give it all a rinse before you move forward! Putting them under the faucet for around 30 seconds should suffice.\n\n\nTry to avoid washing your cherries prior to storing. Adding moisture will dry them out and hurt their taste, so it's better to wash them right before eating. [4]",
                "Pit your cherries. The most complex and unique aspect of eating cherries is the pitting process. While removing the pit from a cherry isn't necessary, leaving them in means you'll have to spit the pit out afterward, as eating them is mildly toxic. Its easy to eat around the pits of fruit like peaches, but a cherry is so small that it should be removed manually. There are several ways to do this, and it's recommended you try out most of them to see which one suits you best. [5]\n\nThe best option if you're going to be eating a lot of cherries is a specialized cherry pitter. These simple contraptions are usually reasonably priced, and can make the pitting process several times faster than they would be if you're doing them by hand.\nIf you're not interested in picking up a pitter, you can get a steady momentum going by using a chopstick and a glass bottle. Place the cherry on top of the bottle with the stem on top, and push the chopstick through the cherry. The pit should fall through into the bottle, eliminating any cleanup from other methods.\nIf you're looking for an easy, basic solution to pitting, take a knife and cut around the edge of the stem. Once you've cut around, you can pull the pit out. This process takes significantly longer than the other methods listed, but it'll do in a pinch if you don't have a lot of utensils around.\nIf you're wanting to circumvent the pitting process altogether, you can always purchase a pack of pitted cherries. Keep in mind, however, that these tend to be less fresh than if you were hand-picking them yourself.",
                "Find somewhere quiet and relaxing to enjoy your cherries. Arguably the most overlooked part of the way someone eats is where they're eating. Trying to eat somewhere busy and crowded isn't going to lend itself to a memorable snacking experience. Find something where you don't have to worry about anything distracting you from your cherries.\n\n\nYou might find it beneficial to add an element of ritual to your cherry-eating. Even if it's just finding a favourite chair to sit in each time you eat them, treating the experience with an air of importance might enrich your experience.",
                "Savour the cherry. It goes without saying that the most important part of enjoying cherries is eating them! The key here is to draw out the experience of eating it; let the cherry sit on your tongue, and let yourself focus on the taste as you bit down into it. Close your eyes, and let your taste buds appreciate each cherry for all they're worth!\n\n\nSavouring food is a lost art in the current age of expedience and efficiency. If you're having a hard time pacing yourself while you eat, try to give yourself approximately 45 seconds for each cherry.",
                "Freeze whatever portions you won't eat soon. It's important to note that cherries are very perishable. In a refrigerator, they might last a week if you're lucky! If you want to save yourself the trouble of constantly going back to the grocery store, you can freeze them in bulk. Bring them out and let them thaw a few hours before you plan on eating them. [6]\n\nFrozen cherries are best eaten within a year, although judging from how delicious they are, it's not likely you'll have them sitting around a fraction of that time!",
                "Research some recipes. If you're new to using cherries in your cooking, it's definitely recommended to look online for some standard options. Most often, cherries are used in dessert dishes for their sweet taste. For certain recipes (particularly baking) you'll want lighter-tinted, sour cherries. If you're adding them as an accent, as you would atop a sundae, you'll want them dark and sweet. You don't have to make up your mind right away, but it's a good idea to have some vague idea what you'd like to make with your cherries.",
                "Prepare cherries as though you were going to eat them on their own. This includes washing and pitting them. Remembering to do this is arguably even more important when you're using them in a recipe; if you cherries in a pie, for example, without first pitting them, the entire pie will end up being ruined!",
                "Bake them in a pie. The most famous use of cherries in cooking is arguably in pies. Cherry pie is a staple dish in many cafes, and for good reason! You can add cherries into your pie whole if you want, or you can mash them into a thick paste so they're able to disperse more evenly. You can even try baking with cherry jam! There are lots of possibilities when it comes to baking; look up some solid recipes, and you'll end up with a delicious summertime treat. [7]",
                "Add them to salads. An even simpler way of adding cherries is through salads. Salads tend to be inclusive of all sorts of fruits and vegetables. You won't need too many cherries to accent your salad-- just a few will give a tangy kick to your meal you won't soon forget. [8]",
                "Accent an ice cream sundae with a cherry! In many ways, an ice cream sundae is the ultimate dessert. It can be made even better by adding a cherry atop some whipped cream. While it will taste great, adding cherries as accents has the extra benefit of boasting some visual panache as well. It's an easy way to give your home concoctions the look of fine dining.\n\n\nFor sundaes, you'll want to get sweeter, darker cherries. The sour taste of light cherries doesn't compliment ice cream nearly as well.",
                "Make a cherry jam. Jam is one of the most versatile creations you can make from fruit. The sweetness in cherries makes them perfect for making jams with. Pit your cherries, pick off the stems, and finely chop them up. Next, add some sugar and pectin, and mix them together until they make an even paste. Next, boil it together. Look up some special recipes, and you'll have your own homemade jam in no time at all. [9]\n\nCherry jam is best served on bread, but it's also great in pies and on ice cream."

        "How to Remove a Chain Link Fence": {
            "intro": "So it's time for that old chain link fence to go the way of the dodo. Removing the \"fence fabric,\" or chain link itself, is the easy part. Removing the fence posts themselves requires more effort, and sometimes the use of a truck or specialized equipment. If your fence is in good condition, you can instead try advertising free fencing material to anyone who is willing to remove it.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider trading the fence material for free removal. If the chain-link fence is in good condition, someone may be willing to remove it for free if he gets to keep the materials afterward.[1] If you can find someone in this position through craigslist or word-of-mouth, you can save yourself a considerable amount of effort.\n\n\nEven if you end up having to remove it yourself, advertising free fence material is a great way to dispose of unwanted items without having to use a truck yourself or pay a disposal fee.",
                "Clear a space on one side of the fence. The goal is to have a flat place on the ground on one side of the fence—preferably on the side opposite the top rail—to lay the fence fabric down flat so it can be rolled up. This should be at least 2 feet (61 cm) wider than the fence fabric is tall. If this space is not available, you can roll it up in smaller sections while its still attached to the fence, but you'll still need at least 2 to 3 clear feet (61 to 91.4 cm) of space.\n\n\nIf possible, clear a pathway for a truck or at least a handcart to reach the fence. This is important for both convenience and safety, since the rolled up chain link will be extremely heavy and difficult to work with.",
                "Protect garden plants nearby. Tie up or trim nearby bushes and trees you want to preserve, or cover smaller desirable plants with an inverted bucket.\n\n\nIf a tree you want to keep has grown through the fence, there's no need to remove it. You can plan to cut the fence on either side of the tree.",
                "Put on protective clothing and eyewear. Chain link removal can scratch you up and sometimes send small pieces of metal flying. Wear thick gloves, eye protection, and a long sleeve shirt and trousers.",
                "Start with an end or corner post. The post in this position is generally wider in diameter than the other posts. The fence fabric will be attached to it by a thin, flat piece of metal called a tension bar that is woven through the fence fabric and attached by clamps to the post.",
                "Remove the clamps holding the fence fabric to the post. The clamps are generally attached with a bolt and nut. Loosen the nut with a wrench and pull the bolt out. Pull the clamps off the fence post. The fence will slacken, but shouldn't fall.",
                "Pull out the tension bar. Weave the metal bar out from the chain link. Save your hardware and the metal bar in a safe place, keeping the ground clear.",
                "Measure out a section to remove. You can eyeball this if you don't have a measuring tape, since posts are typically set 10 feet (3 m) apart. The important part is to choose a section that can easily be rolled up and handled in the space you have available. Use these guidelines to decide on a length, then mark the end of the first section using a piece of colored tape or a knot of colored string.\n\n\nIf you're working in an open, flat area, have an assistant, and are used to manual labor, you can remove the fence in 50 foot (15.24 m) sections.\nIf you are working alone, or if you're not able to lift much, or if there are obstacles in the area, keep the sections no more than 20 feet (6 m) or so each.\nIf you're in a narrow area with no ground space, you'll have to roll the fence vertically, and cut it frequently before it becomes too bulky to handle.",
                "Remove the fence ties a few at a time from your marked section. Fence ties are pieces of wire attaching the fence fabric to the top rail and posts. You can purchase specialized \"fence pliers\" or \"wire grippers\" for this purpose, but most fence ties can be bent back with ordinary heavy pliers or a vise grip.[2] Read the step below before you remove more than a few fence ties.\n\n\nStore the ties in a container as you remove them so they don’t become hazards for people and lawn mowers.\nCutting the ties with bolt cutters is another option, but the creation of sharp wire edges makes this method less than ideal.",
                "Lay the fence fabric on the ground, or roll as you go. As you remove the fence ties, lay the chain fence fabric flat on the ground, without rolling it up. If you do not have the space to do this, you'll have to use a more tedious method instead:\n\n\nLoosen a few fence ties at a time.\nRoll the loose fence, then attach the roll to the top rail with a bungee cord or a piece of wire so it stays upright. Taking extra time and care to secure the roll using strong ties will make it easier for you to handle the fencing, and will ultimately save you time.\nRepeat until the marked section is rolled up along the fence.",
                "Break the fence when you get to the end of your marked section. Stop cutting fence ties when you get to the end of the section you're removing. Follow these steps to detach the chain link you've pulled off from the rest of the fence:\n\n\nFind a wire forming part of the chain link at the top of the fence, just before the post, and unbend the hook it makes over the next wire with your pliers. Straighten the hook out.\nFollow that piece of wire down to the bottom of the fence and unbend it, so it no longer hooks over the next wire.\nBeginning at the top, grab the straightened wire with gloved hands and twist it around, removing it from the fence as you go. The wire should move upward in a spiral, until the two fence sections are separated.",
                "Roll and tie the removed section. Roll up the fence section you've laid on the ground, and tie it securely with wire or rope so it won’t unwind. Move it out of your way.",
                "Repeat until the fence fabric is removed. Continue marking sections and removing the fence fabric as described above. Once all the fabric is gone, move on to the more difficult part: removing the metal rail and poles.",
                "Remove the top rail. Once the chain fence fabric is removed, work on the metal bar running along the top of the fence. Here are several common ways this rail can be attached, and how to remove it:[3]\n\nIf the rail is fastened to a \"cap\" at the top of a corner or end post, loosen the nut and remove the bolt holding the rail and one cap together.\nThe top rail is often made from hollow 10 feet (3 m) lengths of pole. Once the end is detached, twist the lengths of rail apart at each attachment point and slide them apart. In some cases, these sections of top rail will not come apart easily, or at all. If you are unable to separate them by hand, you may need to cut them apart. You can do this with a reciprocating saw, hand grinder, metal abrasive wheel, or hand hacksaw. Make sure the tool you choose has a metal-cutting blade.\nIf the rail is welded, put on a face shield and cut it into manageable segments with a reciprocating saw. Attach a metal-cutting blade, ideally one with roughly 18 teeth per inch (or 1.41mm pitch).[4]",
                "Pull of the post caps. Remove the remaining caps from the post tops and store with the other hardware.",
                "Dig down to expose the concrete. Chain link fence posts are almost always embedded in concrete, making removal a major operation. If the concrete base is buried, use a shovel to dig down until it is exposed.\n\n\nStart with the middle posts first. End posts and corner posts are usually more difficult to remove, due to larger concrete bases.[5]",
                "Soak the ground around the fence post. Loosen the dirt and concrete by soaking the base of the post with water.[6]",
                "Attempt to remove the post and concrete intact. Dig a hole next to the concrete, and push the fence post back and forth until the concrete base falls into the hole. This is the tidiest way to remove the post, but it may not be feasible for large concrete bases, or for fences installed over asphalt or other hard surfaces. For best results, you will have to dig around the entire circumference of the post and concrete base.",
                "Pull out the post with heavy equipment. Large fence posts often can't be removed by hand. Use one of these methods to apply more force:\n\n\nRent a post puller from a heavy equipment rental company. Attach it to the post with a chain and push down on the lever to lift the pole vertically.\nUse a chain to hitch the post to a tractor or truck. Run the chain over a stable object standing next to the post, so the post is pulled vertically instead of sideways.[7] Clear the area of people, as the post may go flying once removed.\nYou can also use a farm jack to remove posts. Wrap a length of chain around the fence post, and secure the other end to the lifting plate on the jack. Then jack the post out of the ground.",
                "Attempt to loosen the fence post. If the methods above don't work, attempt to loosen the post from the concrete. Have a strong person push and pull a fence post repeatedly, or hit it near the base with a sledgehammer. Torque is sometimes more effective than direct pushing, so try gripping the post with a large pipe wrench or vise and turning.[8] Once the post turns or moves, repeat the pulling step above to remove just the metal post, then dig out or fill the concrete base afterward.",
                "Cut the fence post as a last resort. This is not an ideal solution, as you'll end up with potentially dangerous, jagged metal bases left over. If nothing can budge the fence post, however, this may be the last \"DIY\" option available. Use an angle grinder or reciprocating saw, with a metal-cutting blade.\n\n\nAlways wear eye protection when sawing through metal.\nOnce the post is cut, make the area safe by crimping the metal edges, or at least covering it with a planter or other large object.\nFlatten out the rough edges with a small (3-5 lb or 1.4-2.3 kg) hand sledge hammer.\nIf possible, dig down a bit and make your cut below the surface of the ground. Once you have cut the post and flattened the rough edges, cover the cut end of the post with soil.",
                "Break up the concrete with a jackhammer (optional). Once the fence post is removed, get rid of the concrete before disposing of the metal. Rent a small, electric jackhammer from an equipment rental company, and carefully break up the outer edge of the concrete base. Once the cracks have made it to the fence post base, use a hammer and chisel to remove the concrete immediately around the fence post. You can also break up the concrete with a heavy (10-12 lb or 4.5-5.4 kg) sledgehammer.\n\n\nEye protection, hearing protection, thick gloves, and steel-toed boots are recommended.[9]"

        "How to Say Hello in Spanish": {
            "intro": "Even if you've never taken a formal Spanish class, you probably know that \"hola\" (OH-lah) is the word for \"hello\" in Spanish. But in Spanish, just as in English, there are a number of different words and phrases that you can use to greet others. Learning multiple greetings is a good first step towards becoming more conversational in Spanish. Add some local slang, and people just might mistake you for a native.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Start with \"¡Hola!\" This is the basic greeting in Spanish, and can be used to greet any person in any situation. Latin American culture in particular can be quite formal, so when in doubt, this is the best way to greet someone.[2]\n\nIf you encounter a group of people, plan on saying hola to each of them individually. This gesture may not be necessary everywhere, but it will be seen as a sign of respect regardless.",
                "Move to more casual ways of saying \"hello.\" Just as in English, it's common for Spanish speakers to use different greetings when talking to friends or acquaintances, or when greeting one another in a more casual atmosphere.[3]\n\n\"¿Qué pasa?\" (KAY PAH-sah) means \"What's happening?\"\n\"¿Qué tal?\" (kay tahl) means \"What's up?\"\n\"¿Qué haces?\" (kay ah-says) means \"What are you doing?\" or \"What are you up to?\"",
                "Use \"¿Cómo estás?\" (KOH-moh ess-TAHS) as a greeting. Just as in English, Spanish speakers often skip the \"hello\" and move straight to \"How are you?\" as a greeting. You'll change the form of the verb estar depending on who you're greeting.[4]\n\nSay \"¿Cómo estás?\" when speaking informally, to someone your age or younger, or someone familiar.\nIf you're speaking formally, to someone older than you or in a position of authority, you would say \"¿Cómo está?\" You can also say \"¿Cómo está usted?\" When in doubt, address the person formally and give them the opportunity to tell you that it's not necessary.\nWhen speaking to a group of people, say \"¿Cómo están?\" to address everyone.",
                "Switch up your greeting when answering the phone. In most places, if you answer the phone by saying \"¿Hola?\" you'll be perfectly well understood. But most Spanish speakers answer the phone by saying \"¿Aló?\"[5]\n\nIn South America, you also might hear the phone answered \"¿Sí?\" This is especially common in business contexts.\nSpaniards typically answer the phone \"¿Dígame?\" or the shortened form \"¿Díga?\" This also means \"hello,\" but is only going to be used on the phone.\nIf you're the one making the phone call, it's polite to respond to the phone greeting with a greeting based on the time of day. For example, if you're placing the call in the morning, you might respond \"¡Buenos días!\" (boo-AY-nohs DEE-ahs), or \"Good morning!\"",
                "Respond to \"¿Cómo estás?\" with \"Bien, gracias\" (BEE-ehn, grah-SEE-ahs). This basic response means \"I'm well, thanks.\" Just as in English, Spanish speakers typically will say that they are doing well in response to a greeting, even if they're not.[6]\n\nYou also might respond \"Más o menos,\" which means \"okay\" or \"fine.\" It's a little more mellow than \"Bien, gracias.\"",
                "Alter your response depending on the greeting used. Sometimes, even in English, you find yourself on autopilot. Someone says \"What's up?\" and you respond \"Fine, thanks!\" Altering your response keeps you from making this same mistake in Spanish.[7]\n\nFor example, if someone says to you \"¿Qué tal?\" (\"what's up?\"), you might respond \"Nada\" (nah-dah), meaning \"nothing.\"",
                "Say \"¡Buenos días!\" (boo-AY-nohs DEE-ahs) in the morning. While this phrase literally means \"Good days!\" (interpreted as \"good day\"), it is typically used to mean \"Good morning!\" Generally speaking, you can use this greeting anytime before noon.[8]\n\nTypically Spanish greetings based on the time of day are plural. You may occasionally hear \"buen día,\" (\"good day\"), but \"buenos días\" (good days) is far more common.",
                "Use \"¡Buenas tardes!\" (boo-AY-nahs TAHR-days) in the afternoon. If it's after 1 p.m. or so, you can use this afternoon greeting instead of \"¡Hola!\" to say \"Good afternoon!\" In Latin America, you typically wouldn't use this greeting after the sun goes down, but in Spain you may hear it used well into the evening.[9]",
                "Say \"¡Buenas noches!\" (boo-AY-nahs NOH-chays) in the evening. This phrase means \"Good night,\" and is used as both a greeting and a way to say goodbye. When used as a greeting, it would more accurately be translated as \"Good evening!\"[10]\n\nTypically \"¡Buenas noches!\" is considered a more formal greeting, so be mindful of the context. Use it more frequently with strangers, especially those who are older than you.",
                "Try \"¡Muy buenos!\" (moo-ee boo-AY-nohs) at any time of day. \"¡Muy buenos!\" is a shortened version of all of the greetings based on the time of day. If it's around noon, or late afternoon, and you're unsure which greeting would be appropriate, you might want to use this one.[11]",
                "Listen to native speakers. When you first enter a Spanish-speaking country or neighborhood, take a few minutes to listen and absorb the conversations around you. This will allow you to pick up some casual ways locals greet each other.[12]\n\nYou also may be able to pick up some slang by watching Spanish-language television, or listening to Spanish-language music, especially pop music.",
                "Use \"¿Qué onda?\" (kay OHN-dah) in Mexico. The literal translation of this phrase in English (\"what wave?\") doesn't make a lot of sense. But the phrase is commonly used as a casual and informal greeting, generally meaning \"What's up?\" Watch your tone, as this phrase also can be interpreted as something similar to \"You got a problem?\"[13]\n\nAnother common way to say \"hi\" in Mexico is \"Quiubole\" or \"Q'bole\" (pronounced KYOO boh-leh).\n\"¿Qué onda?\" is also common in many other parts of Latin America. If you hear someone else saying it, feel free to use it.[14]",
                "Try \"¿Qué más?\" (kay mahs) in Colombia. This phrase literally means \"What else?\" but is used in Colombia and some other parts of Latin America as a greeting meaning, roughly, \"What's up?\"[15]",
                "Use \"¿Qué hay?\" (kay aye) or \"¿Qué tal?\" (kay tahl) in Spain. These two phrases are used as colloquial greetings in Spain, similar to how you would say \"Hey!\" or \"What's up?\" to a friend in English.[16]",
                "Learn colloquial responses to Spanish greetings. Just as you can greet someone using a slang or colloquial phrase, you also can respond to their greeting in kind. These are phrases you'll likely use with friends or acquaintances, or people around your age.[17]\n\nOne common response is \"¡No me quejo!\" (noh may KAY-hoh), or \"Can't complain!\"\nYou also might respond \"Es lo que hay\" (ess loh kay aye), which means \"It is what it is.\" This can be a clever response if you're asked \"¿Qué es la que hay?\" (kay ess lah key aye), which is a common slang greeting in Puerto Rico.[18]"

        "How to Recognize Signs of Senile Dementia": {
            "intro": "Watching a loved one fall victim to the ravages of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia can be heartbreaking. Dementia is a term used to describe a set of symptoms that impair daily functioning and affect memory, thinking, and social abilities.[1] Nearly 11% of dementia is considered potentially reversible. Potentially reversible dementias are more likely to be seen in patients younger than 65 years old. Depression, hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency are some potentially reversible causes of dementia.[2] There's no cure for dementia, but there are treatments that may help with its symptoms. Knowing the signs of dementia's approach can be a blessing because when you know what the future holds, you can make plans to help a loved one deal with its effects.",
            "steps": [
                "Check for memory loss. Everyone forgets things from time to time. However, dementia sufferers may have difficulty remembering recent events or familiar routes and names.[3]\n\nEveryone’s memory is different, and occasional forgetfulness is common among the general population. Family members and close friends typically will be the best judges of changes in behavior from what he or she was like previously.\n\nHowever, be aware that denial happens. Family members sometimes try to avoid the painful truth that Grandpa is having great issues by normalizing what is not normal, or overlook what should not be overlooked.\nSometimes family members get hyper-sensitive over memory loss issues. Family members sometimes over-react to mild memory issues. For example, if Nana is not taking her pills on time, it may be she needs help from a pharmacist or nurse to organize her medications--she may not need to be in a nursing home.\n\n\nUnderstand normal memory loss versus abnormal loss. As a person ages, it is not uncommon to have some problems with memory. An older individual often has a lot that he or she has experienced, and the brain may not work quite as efficiently as it did in younger years. However, when memory loss starts to impact daily life, that is when intervention needs to happen. Th early signs are different for different people. But common signs include:\n\nInability to care for self: not eating, eating too much, not bathing, dressing inappropriately, not leaving the house, \"wandering\" behavior.\nInability to maintain household chores: Dishes are chronically dirty, garbage not taken out, cooking \"accidents\", filthy house, wearing dirty clothes.\nOther \"odd\" behavior: Calling loved ones at 3 a.m. and hanging up, odd behavior reported by others, emotional outbursts when nothing outward seems wrong.\nThere is a big difference between forgetting when a daughter graduated high school, and forgetting the name of the daughter.\nAlso, there is a significant difference between trying to remember what countries Spain borders, than that Spain is a country.\n\n\nIf memory loss reaches a point where it interferes with day-to-day activities, take the individual to see his or her doctor for more evaluation.",
                "Look for trouble doing tasks they used to do easily.[4] Dementia sufferers may forget to serve the meal they just cooked or forget they cooked it in the first place. People with dementia may have difficulty with other daily tasks such as putting on clothing. Generally, look for obvious declines in daily hygiene and dressing habits. If you notice the individual is having increasing difficulty with these common daily tasks, consider seeing your doctor for further evaluation.",
                "Take note of problems in using language.[5] It's normal for people to fumble for the right word. But, dementia sufferers often get flustered when they can't find the right word. This may cause them to blow up at the person they're talking to, which can be frustrating to both parties.\n\n\nChanges in language usually begin with difficulty remembering words, sayings, and expressions.\nIt will progress to a decline in ability to understand other people's language.\nEventually, the person may be unable to communicate verbally at all. At this stage, people communicate only by facial expression or gesture.",
                "Note signs of confusion.[6] People with dementia often suffer from confusion about spatial, time, and temporal contexts. This is more than simple memory loss or \"senior moments\" — spatial, time, and temporal confusion show an inability to understand where the person is in the moment.\n\n\nSpatial confusion may cause dementia sufferers to forget directions, thinking north is south and east is west. Or that the way they just came is a different route. They may wander off, then forget how they got to a place and how to return to where they belong.\nTime disorientation is marked by the performance of behaviors at inappropriate times. This might be subtle, like slight changes in eating or sleeping schedules. But it can also be more significant: an individual might eat breakfast in the middle of the night and then get ready for bed in the middle of the day.\nPlace disorientation may cause confusion about where sufferers are, causing them behave inappropriately. A person may think the public library is their living room and be angry about people invading their home.\nThey may find it hard to perform common tasks outside of their home due to spatial disorientation. This can be very dangerous, as the individual cannot navigate environments beyond the home.[7]",
                "Do not ignore misplaced items. It is common to misplace the car keys in one's pants pockets, for instance. Sufferers of dementia often place objects in locations that do not make sense.\n\n\nFor example, they may put a purse in the freezer. Or the checkbook ends up in the bathroom medicine cabinet.\n\nBe aware that a person with senile dementia may defend or deflect from this line of logical reasoning, arguing why it makes sense. Be very careful not to try to get into an argument at this point, as you will be unlikely to convince him or her, and agitate the person. He or she is in denial, and is trying to defend from the truth because it is terrifying. It is safer to focus on you as a target than face the truth.",
                "Observe problems with abstract thinking and reasoning. While a normal person may make occasional mistakes in keeping a checkbook, someone suffering from dementia may forget the concept of numbers. They may also fail to recognize that a whistling teakettle means that water is boiling on the stove and let the water evaporate away.",
                "Watch for changes in mood or personality.[8] While people may get moody from time to time, dementia sufferers may have sharp, rapid mood swings. They can go from giddily happy to blazing mad in minutes, or they may become generally irritable or paranoid. Dementia sufferers are often quite aware that they're having problems with common tasks, and this can be frustrating. This sometimes results in outbursts of irritability, paranoia, or the like.\n\n\nAgain, avoid upsetting the individual even further by getting angry, as this is counterproductive to both people.",
                "Check for signs of passivity. The person may no longer want to go to places they used to go, take part in activities they used to enjoy, or see the people they used to see. As day-to-day activities become more difficult, many individuals may become more and more withdrawn. Instead, they may settle into depression, unmotivated to do anything inside or outside of the home.\n\n\nNotice if the person spends hours sitting in a chair and staring into space or watching television.\nLook for declining activity, poor hygiene, and problems with common day-to-day activities.",
                "Compare the current behavior to what you know of the person. Dementia requires a \"constellation\" of erratic and noticeably declining behaviors. No one indicator is enough for a diagnosis. Just forgetting things doesn't necessarily mean someone has dementia. Look for a combination of all the symptoms listed above. The better you know the individual, the easier it will be to notice changes in their usual behavior.",
                "Familiarize yourself with some types of dementia. Dementia is a widely varying condition, and it will look different from patient to patient. In large part, you will be able to predict how the patient will progress by taking the cause of the dementia into consideration.\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease - dementia progresses gradually, usually over the course of years. The exact cause is unknown, but plaques and structures called neurofibrillary tangles have been found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.[9]\n\nLewy body dementia: protein deposits, called Lewy bodies, develop in nerve cells the brain and cause a decline in thinking, memory, and motor control abilities. Hallucinations may also occur, and lead unusual behavior like talking to someone who isn’t there. [10]\n\nMulti-infarct dementia: dementia occurs when a patient suffers many strokes that block a brain artery.[11] People suffering from this type of dementia may have symptoms that stay the same for awhile and then get worse as they have additional strokes. [12]\n\nFrontotemporal dementia: portions of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink causing personality changes or the ability to use language. This type of dementia tends to occur between the ages of 40 and 75.[13]\n\nNormal Pressure hydrocephalus: a buildup of fluid puts pressure on the brain, causing dementia that comes gradually or abruptly, depending on how fast the pressure increases.[14]A CT or MRI will show evidence of this type of dementia.\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease: this is a rare and fatal brain disorder believed to be caused by an unusual organism called a \"prion.\" Though it may be present for a long time before symptoms emerge, the condition comes on very suddenly. A biopsy of the brain will reveal prion proteins believed to be cause of the condition.[15]",
                "Take the person to a doctor. If you think you see a \"constellation\" of behavioral changes and symptoms, you need expert evaluation. In some cases, a primary care physician will be able to diagnose dementia. More often, the patient needs to be referred to a specialist, such as a neurologist or gerontologist.",
                "Provide the patient's medical history. This should include a detailed record of how and when symptoms developed. Based on this review, a doctor may order tests like a blood count or tests for levels of blood glucose or thyroid hormone. These tests will be specific to the type of dementia that your doctor is testing for.",
                "Inform the doctor about all medications being taken.[16] Certain combinations of drugs may mimic or add to the symptoms of dementia. Sometimes, the mixing of unrelated drugs used to treat different diseases causes dementia-like symptoms. This type of drug mixing is common with older people, so make sure you have an accurate medication listing.\n\n\nSome classes of common medications that can cause issues are: benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, neuroleptics, and diphenhydramine (among others).",
                "Be prepared for a full physical examination. A physical exam might identify a disorder that overlap with or contributes to dementia.It may rule out dementia entirely, too. Examples of related conditions include heart disease, stroke, nutritional deficiency, or kidney failure. Variations in each of these factors may give a clue to the type of dementia that needs to be treated.[17]\n\nThe doctor may also conduct a psychiatric evaluation to rule out depression as an underlying cause of a patient's symptoms.[18]",
                "Allow the doctor to evaluate cognitive abilities. This might include tests for memory, math, and language skills, including the ability to write, draw, name objects, and follow directions. These tests assess both cognition and motor skills.",
                "Submit to a neurological evaluation.[19] This evaluation will cover balance, reflexes, sensory and other functions in the patient. This is done to rule out other disorders and identify treatable symptoms. The doctor may also order a brain scan to identify underlying causes like strokes or tumors. The main forms of imaging used are MRIs and CT scans.[20]",
                "Understand whether or not the dementia is reversible.[21] The dementia that arises from certain causes can sometimes be treated and reversed with medical care. Others, however, are progressive and irreversible. It's important to know which category the patient falls into, so you can plan for the future.\n\n\nPotentially reversible causes of dementia include hypothyroidism; neurosyphilis; Vitamin B12/folate deficiency/thiamine deficiency; depression; and subdural hematoma.\nIrreversible causes of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease,multi-infarct dementia, and HIV dementia."

        "wikiHow to Make Nutcracker Drinks": {
            "intro": "The nutcracker is an alcoholic beverage known for its high alcohol content and often bright, neon-type color. Most legends trace the drink back to one New York restaurant or another, and today, nutcrackers are often sold on the streets or beaches in clear plastic bottles or Styrofoam cups. Nutcracker vendors typically have their own unique recipes, but it’s often a rum-based drink blended with a mixture of other hard alcohols and various fruit juices to create a sweet, summer punch. The great thing about nutcracker drinks is that you have the freedom to experiment with different alcohol and juice combinations and quantities until you find a concoction that suits your tastes.",
            "steps": [
                "Assemble your ingredients. A basic nutcracker requires nothing more than hard alcohol and fruit juice. Although this recipe calls for Hawaiian Punch, vodka, and rum,[1] you can substitute in juice or other alcohols if you prefer.",
                "Mix your ingredients. Mix the vodka, rum, and water in a clear plastic single-serve juice bottle. Add enough Hawaiian Punch to fill the remainder of the bottle.\n\n\nFor a stronger drink, increase the amount of vodka, rum, and water in equal increments.\nInstead of Hawaiian Punch, you can substitute other juices, such as apple, peach, or any other juice or fruit-flavored beverage.",
                "Shake and serve. Replace the lid on the juice bottle and shake to mix the ingredients. Serve cold in the juice bottle.",
                "Assemble your ingredients. The NYC recipe is not for a single-drink, but makes a pitcher designed to serve many people.[2]\n\nUse a 750ml (25.35 ounces) bottle of rum if you can’t find the one-liter bottle.\nYou can substitute half the rum for gold or dark rum, and you can also add Southern Comfort for a different variation.\nInstead of all or some of the pineapple juice, consider substituting peach, mango, or cranberry juice.",
                "Mix your drink. In a large pitcher, pour in the entire bottle of rum. Add equal parts amaretto, triple sec, and lime juice. Finally, stir in half a bottle of grenadine, and the pineapple juice.\n\n\nFor the amaretto, triple sec, and lime juice, start with a single ounce (30 ml) of each and adjust to taste if you feel the punch needs more.",
                "Serve. Nutcrackers are served cold, as they are meant to be refreshing summer drinks. Consider serving over crushed ice, or chilling the beverage in the freezer for 15 minutes before serving.",
                "Assemble your ingredients. This particular recipe is for a single-serving nutcracker, but be warned that as per tradition, the alcohol content is quite high.[3]",
                "Mix your ingredients. Measure all your ingredients into a large glass or small pitcher. Serve in a glass or clear plastic juice bottle.",
                "Create a \"nemo.\" Another option for this drink is to serve it semi-frozen like a margarita. A frozen nutcracker is called a nemo, after the movie \"Finding Nemo.\" Instead of mixing ingredients in a pitcher, blend them in a blender with equal parts ice until a slushy consistency is achieved.[4] Serve as usual."

        "wikiHow to Help Your Spouse With Depression": {
            "intro": "Depression is a mental illness that requires treatment just like any other medical condition. If your spouse is suffering from depression, there are things that you can do to help. Helping your spouse get treatment, supporting your spouse during treatment, and taking good care of yourself are all important ways that you can help your spouse recover from depression. Keep reading to learn more about how to help your spouse with depression.",
            "steps": [
                "Recognize the symptoms of depression in your spouse. You may suspect that your spouse is depressed by the way he or she is acting. If you are unsure, there are several common signs of depression that may help you to determine if something is wrong. Some of the common symptoms of depression include:[1]\n\nPersistent sad feelings\nLoss of interest in hobbies, friends and/or sex\nExcessive fatigue or feeling slowed down in thinking, speaking, or movement\nIncreased or decreased appetite\nTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\nTrouble concentrating and making decisions\nIrritability\nFeelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism\nWeight loss or gain\nThoughts of suicide\nAches pains or digestive problems\nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness[2]",
                "Encourage your spouse or partner seek help if they haven't already. Your spouse's depression may be so debilitating that it makes him/her unable to ask for help. He or she may also be embarrassed about their condition. If you suspect your spouse has depression, encourage them to talk to a therapist.\n\n\nArrange for your spouse to talk to a therapist. The therapist may make a referral for your spouse to see a psychiatrist.\nYou can also ask your spouse or partner if he or she wants you to be there for moral support.[3]\n\nIf you are not sure where to start, you can also consider making your spouse an appointment with your spouse's primary care physician to get recommendations.",
                "Educate yourself. Understanding depression, its effects and treatment will allow you to better understand your spouse and help him or her to make informed decisions. Ask questions, read books and visit reliable websites about the diagnosis and treatment of depression. There are many organizations that provide resources for people suffering from depression.[4] Check out some of these websites to find helpful information as you support your spouse.\n\n\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness website offers many resources, from basic information, to support groups, and free courses.\n\nThe American Psychological Association's website offers information on depression, a psychologist search tool, and information on books and articles about depression.\n\nThe Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance website includes a variety of resources, such as podcasts, videos, and a support group finder.",
                "Encourage your spouse to open up to you. Talking openly about depression as a real illness with real consequences often brings relief to people with depression, since it demonstrates that someone cares and is willing to help. It is important for your partner to get professional help, but your partner may also benefit from talking to you about their feelings.\n\n\nSay encouraging things to your spouse every day to let them know that you care. Say something like, “I love you and I am here for you,” before you leave for work. Or acknowledge their accomplishments for the day by saying, “I am so proud of you and what you have accomplished today.”\nLet your spouse know that you are there for them by saying something like, “I know you are going through a difficult time right now, and I just want you to know that I am here for you whenever you need to talk. Even if I am not home and you need to talk, call me and I will be there for you.”",
                "Listen when your spouse wants to talk. Demonstrating that you are hearing your spouse and understanding his or her point of view is another important aspect of supporting them through recovery. Allow your spouse to tell you about his or her feelings and make sure that you allow your spouse to fully express themselves.\n\n\nDon’t pressure your spouse into sharing. Just let them know that you are willing to listen when they are ready and give them time.\nBe attentive as you listen to your spouse. Nod and react appropriately to let them know that you are listening.\nTry echoing what your spouse has just said now and then during the conversation to let them know that you are paying attention.\nAvoid getting defensive, trying to take over the conversation, or ending sentences for them. Be patient even though it might be hard sometimes.\nContinue to make your spouse feel heard by saying things like, “I see,” “Go on,” and “Yes.”[5]",
                "Participate in your spouse's or partner's recovery. While you may not understand the reasons for your spouse's depression, it is important that you support him or her during the treatment process. You may have some idea of what you can do to help your spouse, but if you are not sure you could also ask. Some ways that you could help your spouse include:\n\n\nTaking over some of your spouse’s usual responsibilities. This may mean taking over some of the tasks your spouse or partner used to be responsible for, such as paying bills, talking to people who knock at the front door, dealing with neighborhood disputes, etc. Ask your partner what you could do to help if you are not sure. Keep in mind that you won’t be taking over your spouse’s responsibilities forever, just until he or she recovers. You can also enlist the help of friends and family.\nMaking sure your spouse is taking care of his or her physical needs. Make sure that your spouse is eating well, getting moderate exercise, sleeping well, and taking his or her medications.\nSitting in on some counseling sessions, if possible or desirable (but don't force your spouse or partner to agree to let you sit in).[6]",
                "Provide your spouse or partner with hope in whatever form they can accept. Hope can come in many forms including faith in God, love for their children and any other reason that is meaningful for your spouse. Learn what matters the most to your spouse and remind them about these things during the times they don't think they can hold on any longer. Tell them that bad things pass even if it seems impossible right now, that you'll be there for them through it all, and that he or she is very important in your life.\n\n\nMake sure your spouse understands how much you love them and that you will support them through this difficult time no matter what. Tell them that you know it's not their fault.\nMake sure they know that you understand if they can't meet certain household obligations. Things that you consider normal everyday tasks such as feeding the dog, cleaning the house or paying the bills might be overwhelming to them.\nAlways talk about the illness creating the thoughts in your spouse or partner, and that it is the illness that causes him or her to think things are terrible, impossible, unfixable, etc. Acknowledge your spouse's feelings and promise to work out a solution together.[7]",
                "Encourage your spouse or partner to do the things they used to enjoy and to try new things that might help with their recovery. Ask them to go to the movies with you or to go on walks with you. If they refuse the first few times, just be patient and keep asking. Just don't push too hard, since he or she may not be able to cope with too many activities at once.\n\n\nRemember to praise your spouse or partner whenever they're doing something that benefits them and makes them feel better. A simple statement like \"Thanks for mowing the lawn. It looks beautiful. I really appreciate it\" could mean a lot to a person with depression.[8]",
                "Plan fun things to do. Your spouse might feel more comfortable just spending time at home with you and your family, but you should plan fun activities for the whole family to enjoy. It's good for everyone in a family to have things to look forward to. These will be beneficial for not only your spouse or partner with depression, but also for you and for any kids, as a change in environment will give you all a break.[9]\n\nIf you don’t have kids, consider inviting a couple of good friends over. Just make sure that you invite friends that your spouse feels really comfortable around.",
                "Recognize the signs of suicide. People with depression do sometimes commit suicide when the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness become too much to bear. If you spouse talks about suicide, take it seriously. Don't assume they won't act out on their thoughts, especially where there is evidence that they have a plan. Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:\n\n\nThreats or talk of suicide\n\nStatements implying they don't care about anything or won't be around anymore\nGiving away their stuff; making a will or funeral arrangements\nThe purchase of a gun or other weapon\nSudden, unexplained cheerfulness or calm after a period of depression\nIf you observe any of this behavior get help right away! Call a health care professional, mental health clinic or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to get advice about what action to take.[10]",
                "Look after yourself. It's easy to forget about your own needs when your spouse is in pain, but if you're unable to function properly, then you won't be able to help. In fact, feelings of depression can influence the mood of your entire family. That's why you should be sure to take good care of yourself while you are helping your spouse deal with depression.\n\n\nGet enough sleep, eat well, keep exercising, and keep in touch with family and friends for emotional support.\nSet aside some alone time to step away from the situation.\nConsider getting therapy or joining a support group since this may help you cope better with your spouse's depression.[11]\n\nReduce your stress at work and other situations. Having too many sources of stress will wear you down.\nYou'll also need to deal with the impacts of your spouse's or partner's depression on your kids; seek advice from your doctor and other health professionals in charge of caring for your kids' well-being."

        "wikiHow to Stop Being Controlling": {
            "intro": "If you're worried that you're too controlling, then chances are that you expect every person and every event in your life to be a certain way. You may get frustrated when your significant other, friend, or co-workers don't act the way you want them to act, or when a meeting, a party, or a random Sunday afternoon doesn't go exactly as planned. If you have the urge to micromanage absolutely everything to make it exactly perfect and how you want it to be, then it's time to relax, take a step back, and accept that you can't control everything. Once you do that, you'll find that there's more satisfaction in giving up some control than in taking it. See Step 1 to be on your way to being a less controlling person.",
            "steps": [
                "Stop being a perfectionist. One of the reasons you may be so controlling is because you have the desire for everything to be perfect. You may not want people over if your place isn't spotless; you may spend an extra hour scanning a report for typos without finding any. After a while, this kind of behavior doesn't help you or anybody else. In fact, it is only hurting you and holding you back from living your life. Remember that being a perfectionist is a kind of imperfection in itself, and that the sooner you give up the urge to be perfect, the sooner you can move on with your life instead of analyzing every little thing.\n\n\nThink about it: if you're afraid to have people over because your place isn't perfect, they're much more likely to judge you for not wanting to host than for having a few pillows out of place.\nPerfectionism slows people down. Though it's great to be thorough, there are diminishing returns. Reading a report over once for typos is responsible; reading it over two or three times is a waste of your time.",
                "Work on your self-esteem. A lot of people who are controlling need to work on their self-esteem, when it comes down to it. You may be controlling in your friendships or relationships because you feel that people wouldn't like you or wouldn't spend time with you if you didn't tell them every little thing they had to do. You may feel that you're unworthy, and that if you leave people to their own devices, that they may figure out that they don't like you. You need to stop this kind of thinking and realize that you are an amazing and worthy person who just needs to relax a bit.\n\n\nTalking to a therapist or a close friend about your self-esteem issues, anxiety, or any other underlying causes for your controlling behavior can be a big help. This can help you get to the root of the matter that is causing you to be controlling.",
                "Work on managing your anxiety. Another reason you may be controlling is because you are riddled with anxiety, always thinking of the worst thing that can happen in a situation, or being terrified of facing the unknown. If this is the case, then you need to work on relaxing and realizing that it's not the end of the world if you face the unknown. Think of all of the things that can happen in a given situation, not just the absolute worst ones, and you will be far better off.\n\n\nOf course, it can take a long time to manage your anxiety, though yoga, meditation, cutting back on the caffeine, or taking the time to find the root causes of your problems can help.",
                "Stop having to be right all the time. People who are controlling are often obsessed with proving that they have the best idea of how to do things or that they have the correct opinion about absolutely everything under the sun. If you want to be less controlling, then you have to work on letting others be right once in a while, and seeing that it's not the end of the world if you don't know the answer or if someone else has more experience or more insight into a given situation.\n\n\nThink about it: what's the worst that can happen if you don't know the answer to something? It happens to people all the time. You may think that people will judge you or think you're inferior in some way, but that won't happen. They'll be much more likely, in fact, to think you're flawed if you never admit that you're wrong.\nPart of not always being right is opening yourself up to vulnerability. Nobody said this would be pleasant, but this is the way to trust people and to show that you're only human. You want people to be able to relate to you, don't you?",
                "Practice acceptance. If you want to stop being controlling, then you have to work on accepting things as they are. Though it's great to see something that needs improvement and to go out and change it, it's another thing to try to micromanage and change every little thing until it's exactly like you want it to be. Work on accepting the general tenor of things at your work, in your home, and in your relationships.\n\n\nOf course, revolutions are started by people who see things that need a major change and work hard to get there. But we're not talking about you being Che Guevara here. We just want you to feel at peace with the situation around you instead of trying to \"fix\" problems that don't really exist.",
                "Know that giving up control can be just as rewarding as taking it. You may think that planning a project detail by detail or planning your wedding without any help from scratch will make you feel powerful, or maybe even invincible. And sure, there's some strength in being able to fully control a situation. But you know what else you'll feel? Exhausted. Stressed out. Like you can never measure up. Instead, letting other people help out, or even take the reigns, can be the biggest reward of all.\n\n\nInstead of putting pressure on yourself, you'll learn to love the idea of working with other people to achieve a common goal -- or even to let them work a bit more while you take a break.\nStart small. You don't have to delegate all of the duties for a major project for work as your first exercise. Instead, let your coworker choose the place where you're going to go for your lunch break. Was that so hard? If not, take a bigger step toward giving up control and see how it feels.",
                "Learn to have faith in other people. One of the most important things you have to do is to realize that other people are just as competent, intelligent, and hardworking as you are. Okay, so unfortunately, this doesn't mean all of them. It makes sense that you're not asking your messy little sister to help you clean up the kitchen, or that you're not asking Lazy Bob to proofread a report for you; some people around us just can't really help us out. But there are plenty of good, helpful people out there, and if you want to live a happier life, you have to learn to believe in them so you can trust them to help you and to make their own decisions.\n\n\nThink about it: if you're always telling your boyfriend, your best friend, or your lab partner exactly what to do, then how would that make them feel? They'd feel like you don't trust them because you think they're not as smart/together/awesome as you. Is that how you want the people you care about the most to feel?",
                "Delegate. If you want to stop being so controlling, then you've got to learn to delegate tasks to other people. Gone are the days when you throw everything upon yourself and annoy everyone with what a bossy, stressed-out person you've become. Instead, learn to delegate tasks to people, whether you're asking a co-worker to help out on a project or asking your friend to pick up the appetizers for a party you're throwing. Once you believe in other people, you should be able to ask them to help you out.\n\n\nSure, it takes humility to ask for help, but you'll get used to it. Everybody gets through life with some kind of help, and you should be no different.",
                "Listen and learn from others. Along with having faith in people and being able to delegate to them, you should work on being able to actually learn from them. You may feel that you're the only person who has anything to teach people, but if you actually let other people in and hear them out, you'll find that you're mistaken. You can't be the expert on everything, and there will always be people who have more insight or experience than you about certain subjects. Once you step back and really listen to other people, you'll find that you do have plenty to learn.\n\n\nDon't interrupt people. Let them finish what they have to say and really take the time to think it over before you bring out your own ideas.",
                "Let people be who they are. Though everyone has room for improvement, you have to stop trying to change people into the people you want them to be. Instead, you should work on letting them be who they are, and to act how they want to act, instead of conforming to your way of living and thinking. Of course, if your boyfriend does something that drives you crazy, you should talk about it, but you can't expect him to turn into a completely different person, just like he can't ask you to be someone you're not.\n\n\nIt's one thing to talk about room for improvement and to help others work to become a better version of themselves. But it's another thing entirely to try to change them into something they are not.",
                "Work out your jealousy issues. A lot of the reasons for why you may be controlling others may have to do with jealousy. You may be jealous that if you don't tell your best friend where to go, that she'll end up hanging out with some other friends. You may be jealous that if your boyfriend doesn't call you every hour, that it means he's with another girl. You have to learn to value yourself, and to trust that other people feel the same way about you. If you have real reasons to be jealous, then it's one thing, but if it's all in your head, then you need to work on having a more rational mindset and a more healthy outlook.\n\n\nAsk yourself why you tend to feel jealous. Is it because of a past betrayal, or does it come from your feelings of insecurity?\nIf you want to be in a healthy, mutually-beneficial relationship, then you have to work on kicking those feelings of jealousy to the curb.",
                "If what you're doing isn't helping a situation, then stop it. Sure, it can help to be controlling in some situations. If your child is misbehaving, you need to lay down the law. If your boyfriend is always late for work, you can remind him to set his alarm. But if some controlling behavior is clearly not improving the situation, it may be time to cut it loose. You need to recognize when you're just interfering and meddling, and learn to stop doing it.\n\n\nFor example, if you keep trying to micromanage one of your employees and all it leads to is resentment and lower productivity, it may be time to cut back. If your best friend is depressed because she lost her job and you call her every day to see if she's applied for any new jobs and it's only making her more upset, it may be time to cut back.",
                "Talk to a friend about your struggle. It can help to get another perspective about your controlling behavior. Just having someone to talk to about your feelings and your determination to change can go a long way in improving your behavior. If you're dealing with this alone, it will be harder to get motivated to truly change your mindset. Having a friend's love and support can help you see that you are capable of change and that you really can move forward and be on the way to feeling better.\n\n\nYou can even meet weekly with your friend to discuss your progress. If you tell someone else about your intentions, you can feel accountable to them and will be more motivated to change.",
                "Stop giving advice to everyone. Another thing controlling people do is constantly give \"advice\" to people about every little thing, from how they should act in their relationships to what they should order for dinner. This \"advice\" that you give is really more of a command or order in disguise, and you need to work on avoiding this kind of behavior if you want to be less controlling. When your input is needed or when you think you can really help, then giving advice can be a great thing to do, but in general, you should avoid giving your advice to people, especially if it's unsolicited.\n\n\nIf you always tell people what you \"suggest\" is the best thing to do, you'll get a reputation for being a know-it-all.",
                "Stop planning every second of your day. People who are controlling just love to plan, plan, plan. They know exactly when they'll get up, how many spoonfuls of sugar they'll have in their morning coffee, what time they'll get in the car to drive home, and exactly what they'll wear every day of the week. If you want to stop being controlling, you have to learn to let go of all that. While it's important to be organized and to feel like you're moving in the right direction, it's also important to leave some wiggle room for change, and to accept that you won't know exactly what will happen during every second of your day.\n\n\nTry it out. Go into your weekend without having one thing planned and then just do what you feel like doing. If you get a last minute invitation to do something fun, you should accept it.\nThough many people like having a planner, make sure that there are at least ten free hours in your week that you don't have a game plan for. Then move that up to fifteen, or even twenty. This will help you relax and see that things will still be okay if you don't always know exactly what's going to happen.",
                "Learn to go with the flow. Controlling people tend to avoid getting lost in the moment, taking spontaneous trips, or just doing something completely crazy because that's what people feel like doing. They have a plan and they are determined to stick to it at all costs. So, it's time to give all that up, and to just enjoy being by yourself and hanging out with other people without knowing what will happen next.\n\n\nThe next time you're with a group of people, hold your tongue when it comes to deciding what to do. Let them decide. You'll see that it wasn't nearly as bad as you expected it to be!",
                "Become more flexible. If you want to work on being less controlling, then you have to make room for some flexibility in your schedule. Maybe something came up last minute with your boyfriend, and you'll have to move your date night up a day. Will that be the end of the world? Maybe your meeting at work got rescheduled for the afternoon; maybe your sister needs your help with her kids and no one else can do it. Learn to take the things that life throws at you, and to be flexible enough to not let it feel like a tragedy if your week doesn't turn out like you expected it to.\n\n\nTo really be flexible, you have to realize that ultimately, a few unexpected hours in your week or a few last-minute changes won't have a huge impact on your life. Once you realize this, you'll feel much more free and open to possibilities."

        "How to Get Rid of Pubic Lice": {
            "intro": "Public lice, also known as crabs, are a non-threatening infection of parasites. Lice are small insects that live on hair follicles and are transmitted by direct physical contact. Though uncomfortable, treating pubic lice is easy and can be done at home.",
            "steps": [
                "Diagnose public lice correctly. Lice resemble small, moving crabs usually found around the genitals, though they sometimes be in armpits, eyebrows, or facial hair. If you cannot see whether you have public lice then use a magnifying glass – they are grey-brown, crab-like insects 5-7 millimeters large.[1] Use a magnifying glass to check for lice if you have the following symptoms:\n\n\nPale blueish bite marks.\nSmall, white dots attached to the base of your hairs (lice eggs).\nLow-grade fever.[2]",
                "Buy an over-the-counter lice treatment. Lice shampoos, lotions, and insecticides are available at your local pharmacy. You should select a lice-killing lotion with 1% permethrin or a mousse that contains pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide.[3]\n\nPerform a “spot test” to check for allergic reactions. Place a small amount of the lotion on your arm or leg and wait 10 minutes to check for itching or swelling.",
                "Wash the infected area with soap and water. Clean your body the best you can and dry yourself off before applying medication. Do not try to scrub the lice away as they are evolved to hold to your hairs.",
                "Apply medication to the affected area. You should treat yourself and any people who have had close contact with you in the last week (sharing beds, sexual activity, borrowing towels, etc.). Apply the shampoo or lotion according to the directions on the bottle, which usually require you to apply the liquid and leave it for 20 minutes or more.",
                "Wash off the treatment after the appropriate time. All creams need time to work, but do not be tempted to leave them on for longer than recommended. These products are poisons and they will damage your skin if not washed away properly.[4]",
                "Pick out any remaining eggs. Most lice treatments do not kill eggs (known as “nits”), so you will need to remove them by hand. Using tweezers or an fine-toothed nit-comb, carefully pull out any small white eggs or remaining bugs.[5]",
                "Repeat the treatment 7-10 days later. To be safe, you should always retreat yourself to make sure no lice survived. Lice eggs hatch after 10 days, so repeating the treatment ensures that none survived the first round.[6]",
                "Know that shaving alone will not eliminate public lice. ’\"Pediculosis Pubis,\" or public lice, are resilient creatures that can live on other parts of your body, including your armpits and eyelashes. Shaving will not get rid of the problem, but it can help in conjunction with lice-treatments.[7]",
                "Use a prescription medication if public lice return. There are several prescription options available for treating public lice, but they should be used as a last resort. Stronger creams are more toxic and can cause illness or skin damage in large doses.\n\n\n’’’Lindane Shampoo:’’’ Kills lice and eggs, and is available by prescription. It can be toxic, however, and should be used only when other options fail. Never use lindane on small children, people with a history of seizures, the elderly, or pregnant women.\n’’’Malathion Lotion:’’’ Known by the brand name “Ovid,” this is another prescription method that has had success with stronger cases of lice. It has not, however, been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[8]",
                "See a doctor if lice persist or don’t respond to treatment. If you can’t get rid of your public lice after two rounds of treatment you should see a health professional. They may write you a prescription or send you to a specialist if they problem is not treated quickly.[9]\n\nIf you develop any redness, pain, or swelling, you should talk to your doctor about a possible infection.",
                "Know that most home remedies are ineffective at removing lice. While there are steps you can take to remove lice at home, most medical professionals at the CDC and National Health Service believe that medication is the only way to truly remove lice. That said, the following steps can control lice and relieve itching.[10]",
                "Comb out public hair with a fine toothed comb. A specialized nit-comb, bought at any pharmacy, is made to remove lice. Comb your hair, starting at the base of the hair and combing all the way up, to physically remove lice.",
                "Apply petroleum jelly 2-3 times a day. Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline) can prevent lice from gripping your hair and make it easier to comb out. The jelly smothers the bugs, suffocating them. After applying the jelly, use a fine-toothed comb to try to remove the lice.\n\n\nMake sure the jelly covers the hair from the base to the tip.",
                "Use calamine lotion for itch relief. Calamine may also help smother lice, killing them when it dries. More importantly, calamine relieves itching, which may prevent you from scratching your skin and creating an infection.[11]\n\nApply the lotion 2-3 times a day.",
                "Immediately wash all bedding, clothes and towels used in the last two days. You want to use hot water and dry the clothes for at least 20 minutes on high. Borax detergent has also been found to kill lice in bedding and towels.[12]",
                "Store unwashable items in air-tight containers for three days. If you cannot wash something, like a stuffed animal or fragile clothing, seal it in an air-tight bag for at least 72 hours to suffocate the lice.[13]",
                "Treat other people close to you in advance. If you share a bed with someone or have had a sexual partner in the last few weeks, have them apply lice treatment now to prevent an infection later.",
                "Inform any recent sexual partners that you have public lice. This may be difficult, but you need to let people know about your situation so they can treat themselves and prevent spreading the disease. Avoid future sexual contact until you have completely treated the problem.",
                "Know that lice cannot survive without a human host for more than 2 days. You do not need to throw out all of your furniture, burn your blankets, and buy a new wardrobe. Public lice will die without a human host after 48 hours, so if you contain the infected people, wash all the bedding, and follow treatment directions you can prevent an outbreak of public lice with ease.[14]",
                "Know that pubic lice can live on eyelashes, especially in young children. Though uncommon, public lice have been known to survive on smaller children by clinging to their eyelashes. This usually occurs when children share a bed with parents or siblings who have contracted public lice.\n\n\nBe aware that pubic lice on young children can be a sign of sexual abuse.[15]",
                "Pull off any visible lice with fingernails or tweezers. Usually there are only a few lice on eyebrows or eyelashes, and they can be removed by plucking and flushing them down the toilet. Make sure you get everything to prevent reinfestation.\n\n\nLice are small, grey-brown insects that resemble crabs.\nThe eggs, or nits, are small white dots usually found at the base of the hair.",
                "Treat persistent cases with petrolatum jelly. Apply the jelly around the edges of the eyes 2-4 times a day. Be sure to get ophthalmic-grade petrolatum ointment, which is available by prescription, as Vaseline can cause eye irritation.[16]",
                "Never use lotions, shampoos, or toxic creams near the eyes. These creams can cause permanent eye damage, and should never be used for cases along the eyes or eyelashes. Similarly, do not use creams for children unless directed by a doctor."

        "wikiHow to Become a Better Rugby Player": {
            "intro": "Once you've learned the basics of rugby, anything seems possible on the field. All you can imagine is breaking through a big tackle, hitting the game-winning kick, or crushing an opponent right as they catch the ball, but your skills can't seem to catch up to your imagination. However, if you keep working on the basic skills, as well as sharpen your \"rugby brain,\" you'll be a better rugby player in no time.",
            "steps": [
                "Stick to your position instead of switching frequently (unless you're new because you need to find the right position first). You will never make a good player if suddenly you move from prop to center. Each position has its own requirements and needs, and you won't become a better player if you switch positions just as you're learning one of them well.\n\n\nYou should, however, have a basic understanding of each of your teammate's positions. Rugby is a fluid, fast game, and you can best support your teammates if you know what they're trying to do.\nIf you're uncomfortable with your role on the field, check out diagrams of each position and its role.",
                "Play as a unit, not as a superstar or a hero. Do not try to be a hero, just play the game and do what your position is designed to do. There are 30 players on the field at any time in a game of rugby -- making it nearly impossible for one player to try and win the game on their own. Successful rugby teams are filled with players who know their role and stick to it.\n\n\nEach position is designed to compliment the others. If you decide you want to start rucking as a scrum-half, you may win a few more lose balls. Your fly-half, however, will lose the connection that gets him the ball, effectively destroying your offense.\nEveryone will leave position occasionally for a tackle or run. The key is choosing your moment wisely -- will you be putting your team at a disadvantage by leaving?[1]",
                "Support your team's runs by staying diagonally behind the ball carrier. If your teammate is on a run, the best place to be is a few yards behind them and a few yards to their side. This makes you a viable, legal passing target at all times. If someone is already there, set up alongside them, providing a quick passing outlet should they get the ball. The best teams set up these small diagonal passing lines almost instantly.\n\n\nIf there is already a small line of players, stay just behind them, ready to ruck if one goes down, or take a short offload pass as they're falling.[2]",
                "Keep your head up and scanning at all times, even in tackles. The best way to improve your on-field intelligence is to keep tabs on everything. Are you in line with your teammates? Are the opponents overloading more people on one side of the field for an attack? You should keep your head up on tackles too -- watching the contact the whole time to safely place your head and adjust to defenders.[3]\n\nGrab any loose ball you see, or fall on it and place it for a ruck.\nAre you in step with your teammates? Make sure your lines are tight and there are no holes.",
                "Make ball possession your first priority. In rugby, any team can grab possession at almost any time, and offense switches to defense on the fly. This makes it much more crucial to hold onto the ball, tiring the other team on defense until a good scoring opportunity arises. While all good teams take occasional risks, the majority of their efforts are spent keeping the ball.\n\n\nIf you don't have any support, slow down and wait for it. You can keep the ball in the ruck a little longer while your team catches up, or skip out on a risky run up the sideline until you have someone to pass to or ruck for you.\nOnly make passes you know will connect. If you don't have a good pass, simply go into contact, let your teammates ruck, and reset.\nDon't be worried if you go 3-4 plays without gaining a lot of ground. Being on defense is much more tiring than offense, and you'll expose a hole eventually.",
                "Know when to commit to a ruck and when to set up outside. Beginners often aren't sure when they should join the ruck, and will often either jump into every single ruck they find or never join in at all. Knowing when to bind on and help your team can be tough to decide, but there are some guidelines:\n\n\nIf you're winning a ruck as a team, don't join in. Similarly, if you've already lost or almost lost a ruck, get out of there and defend the rest of the field.\nIf you see a teammate get tackled there are more defenders than teammates, get over quickly in order to defend possession.\nIf you're near a stalemating ruck, throw yourself in to turn the tide.\nScrum-halfs and fly-halfs, with a few exceptions (losing a crucial ruck, the only player near enough to join) should stay out of most rucks -- they are too essential for organizing the offense and defense to be rucking.[4]",
                "Commit to every ruck, tackle and play with full confidence. The biggest hurdle for most beginner rugby players isn't a skill, idea, or trick -- it's confidence. While confidence factors into all sports, in rugby the knowledge that you can take a hit (or hit an opponent) and be okay is not something everyone is born with. It takes time to get used to the physicality of rugby. However, the ability to give it your all, and not to slow down or loosen up before contact, will actually make you safer in the long run.\n\n\nGain confidence by tacking hits in practice. Start at 50% speed, or by tackling from your knees, and gradually work up to full contact.\nThink of going through an opponent, not at him. Keep your feet moving at all times to drive through tackles and rucks with ease.\nMentally prepare yourself for games and hits. Remind yourself that you've done this before, and that playing soft or trying to avoid contact will just lead to more injuries.[5]",
                "Watch Professional Rugby, focusing on your position. Watch any team that you like, from the best teams in the world like South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to the premier club teams in England, France, New Zealand and Australia. Watch out for several thing in particular:\n\n\nWhere is your position on defense? Where are they on offense?\nHow does each team dictate the pace of the game? When they attack, do they go wide or jam big players up the gut?\nWhen and where are the appropriate times to kick?\nWhen is it best to try a last-minute pass and when is it best to just go down?",
                "Keep your spine straight on rucks, tackles, and scrums. One of the biggest improvements you can make playing rugby is your technique. The best players use their bodies efficiently, wringing out every ounce of energy to gain an advantage over the opponent. One of the best things you can do, in almost any situation, is flatten your back. Not only is a curved spine dangerous, it cuts your power down significantly. There are several ways to work on proper back technique:\n\n\nKeep your butt down by bending at the knees and waist, not through your back.\nNever let your head and shoulders dip below your hips.\nDo a low-key rucking or scrumming drill, then lock in your \"driving\" position. Stay in place and have a teammate place a ball horizontally on the small of your back. It should not roll off.",
                "Learn to run effectively with the ball anywhere on the field. Rugby is much more fluid than football, so you don't want to keep the ball locked up under your arm like a running back. Instead, you need to adapt your hold depending on the situation:\n\n\n\nGeneral Play: Hold the ball with your fingertips right near the center of your chest, with the point facing up. This allows you to quickly pass , fake or kick in any direction.\n\nUnder Pressure / Being Tackled: Grip the ball horizontally with both hands and forearms. Your left forearm is on the top of the ball, your left hand gripping the right end, and your right forearm is on the bottom of the ball, with your right hand gripping the left point. This is for the moment you know you'll be tackled or someone tries to steal the ball, and is usually used by forwards.\n\nOpen Field: Tuck the ball into the crook of your elbow, gripping it with one hand. This gives you plenty of speed and mobility for a one-on-one or open field run. As you get tackled, you place your other hand over the ball to protect it, turning away from the tackler.[6]",
                "Learn how to get tackled. With all the focus on \"huge hits\" and the best tackling form, many players forget how often they are the ones getting hit. Learning to take a tackle well helps your team win more rucks, helps you gain ground on a defender, and protects you from injuries.\n\n\n\nTurn the ball away from the defender. As you approach, pick a side to run at and turn the ball away, lowering your shoulder slightly towards the opponent.\n\nKeep moving your feet forward. This might seem terrifying, but you want your momentum running through him, not the other way around. The player that eases up or slows down is almost always the one who gets hurt.\n\nFall \"in order.\" You should hit the ground first with your knees, then hips, then shoulders to distribute your weight when you fall.\n\nPlace the ball back towards your team. You have 1-2 seconds after going down to place the ball, so do your team a solid and reach back. Remember that any defender is going to need to step over you to get the ball, so placing it far back gives your team crucial time to run.",
                "Ensure that you can throw accurately to both sides. You want, at a minimum to make a 10 yard pass to either side of you, hitting your teammate in the chest every time. The only way to get there is to practice, so make sure you spend time every single day throwing a rugby ball to both sides.\n\n\nSpiral or spinning passes are great, but unless you're accurate the beauty of your spin doesn't matter.",
                "Execute perfect offloads as you take tackles. The offload is when you pop the ball up to teammate as you're going down, allowing them to dodge your tackler and keep running. Most beginners are told not to offload, and for good reason: it is very easy to make a terrible pass while you're being pulled violently to the ground. However, as you get better you'll notice how often the pros offload, keeping a run alive and slowly chipping past the defense. To perfect the offload--\n\n\nEnsure that your teammate is ready for the ball my making eye contact with them.\nDo not spin the ball, it is too difficult under pressure. Instead, use a a short, quick 1-3 yard \"pop\" to toss the ball to them.\nIf you're in doubt, go into contact. If you don't think you can pull the pass off, or if a 2nd defender is coming in, just take the tackle. Remember-- possession is more important than on good run.[7]",
                "Whenever possible, receive and throw the ball while moving forward. You do not want to be caught standing in rugby, as this is the easiest way to get lit up with a huge hit. You want your passes to lead your teammates so that they can keep their momentum up as they catch, and you want to be in full stride when your catch the ball. This keeps the defense guessing your movement, makes you more painful to tackle, and helps your team gain ground quickly. Once you can pass accurately, you need to learn to pass accurately on the run. A line of 4 players, running and passing simultaneously, is very difficult to contain, especially if you can \"swing\" the ball from one pass to the other.\n\n\nAdjust your grip on the ball as you catch it.\nDrop the ball towards normal hip-height for a throw.\nOpen your hips up towards the direction you're passing.\nSwing the ball across your body, pointing with your hips.\nFollow through with both hands pointing at the target.[8]",
                "Practice your position-specific skills in your own time after practice. Each position is different, and the best rugby players carve out extra time to get better at their specialty. Spend 10-15 minutes after practice working on your skills. If you don't know what to work on, ask your coach.\n\n\nKickers should hit penalties for at least 10 minutes every day, from all points on the field.\nForwards can hit the scrum sled, focusing on their scrum, ruck, and tackling technique.\nFly-halfs and backs should work on kick and catching punts.",
                "Push yourself as hard as possible in drills, scrimmages, and practice. Rugby requires full body strength, and the best way to develop your strength is simply by playing rugby. This activates you muscles the way they need to activate in a game, but you won't get the benefits if you're only giving 50% at practice. Rugby practice should be your fitness every day you go, and you should be prepared to give it all each drill to grow stronger.[9]",
                "Know how to train for your position. Each player on the field needs a slightly different toolkit in order to succeed. While every player should be able to run for at least 80 minutes and have good overall muscle mass, training to play prop is very different from training to play wing. Though each position has it's own needs, in general you can group training schedules by backs and forwards:\n\n\n\nAll Players: Core exercises, endurance training, strong quads, butt, and back.\n\nBacks: Should focus on sprint training, being able to run near top speed even towards the ends of games. Strength training is imperative, but not so much that you lose speed and mobility.\n\nForwards: Need to focus on strength and mass. Bigger people make a bigger impact in the scrum and on rucks, and are harder to take down or get through. More of a forward's time is going to be in the weight room than the a back's.",
                "Focus on interval training to build endurance. A rugby game is a constant ebb and flow -- sprint, jog, ruck, rest, jog, walk, recover (penalty call!), scrum, etc. While long, 3-5 mile runs are fine for general endurance, rugby players will get more out of interval training. Intervals are when you alternate short, high-energy sprints with jogging and walking. Some good routines to start with might be:\n\n\nSprint the try-line, then jog up the sideline to the other end. Sprint that try-line too, and repeat 5x. Rest and do it once more. Add an extra lap each day you train, or add the half-field or 22-meter lines into the mix.\nRun at 80% top speed for 30 seconds, then jog for a minute. Repeat 10 times. As you get better, decrease your jogging time until you are at only 30 seconds.\nRun up a set of stairs, then lightly jog done. Rest for 10 seconds at the bottom, then repeat.\nMix in push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and burpees (A push-up followed immediately by a jumping jack) during your jogs. Stop, perform the exercise for 30 seconds, then immediately keep jogging.[10]",
                "Develop a total-body weight lifting program. Running, tackling, driving, jumping, throwing, diving -- a rugby player needs to be strong enough for almost any physical activity imaginable. This makes strength training a major part of any serious rugby player's schedule. While you should work with a coach or trainer to develop a routine for you and your position (a scrum-half, after all, should not be as bulky as a prop), there are a few exercises every rugby player should do. All of these exercises activate multiple muscles, meaning that you can even do them 1-2 per week in season to stay strong.\n\n\nSquats\nDeadlifts\nBench Press\nMilitary Press\n\nPower Clean[11]",
                "Add plyometrics and body-weight exercies to your workouts for explosive speed and power. Plyometrics are bounding, jumping, and other explosive workouts. You usually do them with high-reps, getting your body used to the types of movements it would make in a game. What's more, you can often do these workouts without the aid of a gym. Focus on doing enough reps so that the last 5 of every set are difficult -- this is when you make the most gains.[12]\n\nTry bounding, which is when you \"run\" 30 meters while keeping yourself in the air (both feet off the ground) for as much time as possible.\nBox jumps\nPull-ups\nChin-up\nPush-ups.\n\nCore exercises.[13]",
                "Use planks and body holds to strengthen your core. Your core is where you transfer energy from your top half to your bottom, and this sort of power is essential to turn the drive of your legs into a successful tackle with your arms. Try out:\n\n\nPlanks.\nAbdominal holds.",
                "Cross train with other sports to build total body muscle. The English National Rugby Team has wrestling and judo coaches on staff, as the sport helps safely develop the grappling strength needed in mauls, rucks and tackles.[14] Try out:\n\n\nSwimming sports, like water polo. Swimming uses your whole body with minimal pressure on your joints.\nBiking and running. They are essential for total endurance, and hill-sprints build valuable butt and quad muscles needed to drive back opponents.\nRock climbing. Scrambling effectively up a wall requires coordination, fine motor control, and serious leg and forearm strength that will make you more effective on runs and tackles."

        "wikiHow to Clear Your Throat": {
            "intro": "Singers, speakers, actors, and anybody who uses his or her voice as a tool knows the importance of throat clearing. This helps free the throat of mucus in order to project a strong, in-tune voice. If your throat is congested, there are over-the-counter products and home remedies that can help you clear your throat.",
            "steps": [
                "Stay hydrated. If you have a lot of mucus in your throat, hydration can help. Liquid can help soften mucus, making it easier to expel from the body.[1]\n\nTry to drink about eight glasses of water daily. If you're struggling with a sore throat, you may want to increase your water intake slightly. Seltzer water may help with a scratchy throat.[2]\n\nTry to stay away from fruit juices and soda. The added sugar can cause additional throat irritation. If you want something other than water to drink, go for sports drinks or fresh squeezed juices that use only natural sugar.[3]\n\nThere is a belief that milk and dairy products increase phlegm production, but there is no scientific evidence that this is true.[4] They may cause the phlegm to be thicker and more irritating to your throat, but frozen dairy products can also be soothing and a good source of calories when you may not be eating because it is difficult to swallow.[5]",
                "Try honey and lemon. Honey and lemon both help soothe the throat. Try adding a squeeze of lemon juice and a teaspoon to a glass of ice water or tea. Not only can this help clear phlegm, it may also ease any pain or irritation you are experiencing.\n\n[6]",
                "Eat spicy foods. Spicy foods can sometimes result in phlegm loosening. This can make it easier to remove via blowing your nose, coughing, and sneezing. Chile, peppers, wasabi, horseradish, and other spicy foods can help clear your throat.[7]",
                "Drink herbal teas. Some people find herbal teas help soothe the throat. Try a variety of teas and see if you notice any effect on your throat.\n\n\nChamomile, ginger, and lemon teas are most frequently cited as helping with congestion.[8]\n\nSome people find green tea is soothing for your throat. Try adding honey or lemon to green tea for added effect.[9]",
                "Choose healthy foods for your voice. Certain foods are good for the voice and help promote a clear throat. Whole grains, fruit, and vegetables contain vitamins A, E, and C which help keep the throat free of mucus. If you have a sore or strained throat, try eating softer foods until the irritation clears.[10]",
                "Take mucus-thinning medication. Mucus thinning medications like guaifenesin (Mucinex) can help reduce phlegm that causes coughing and throat irritation. If you're looking to clear your throat, look for such medications at your local supermarket or pharmacy. Take the meds as directed on the container. If you're concerned about over-the-counter medication interacting with any prescription meds you're on, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.[11]",
                "Use saline nasal sprays. Saline sprays and nasal drips can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drug store. They tend to be fairly effective in clearing out phlegm and other irritants that cause throat irritation.[12]\n\nIf you're using a spray or drops, use as directed on the container. Ask a doctor or pharmacist if you have any additional questions.[13]\n\nIf you're using a nasal irrigation system that requires squirting water into the nose, always use sterile water. Microorganism found in tap water can get into the brain through the nose, causing health problems and even death.[14]",
                "Try over-the-counter pain medications if your throat is sore. Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen can ease pain caused by a sore throat. This can reduce symptoms like coughing and wheezing, which can make a clogged throat worse. As always, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the medication.[15]",
                "Quit smoking. If you smoke, you should make an effort to quit. Smoking is bad for your overall health. It can make you more susceptible to throat infections such as bronchitis and strep throat. It can also cause overall damage to the throat and vocal cords, resulting in discomfort and congestion. Talk to your doctor about quitting smoking.[16]\n\nSmoking also predisposes a person to carcinogens which can lead cancer.",
                "Invest in a humidifier. Oftentimes, a dry environment can result in throat irritation. Consider purchasing a humidifier if you live in a dry area. Turning a humidifier on during the day or overnight can increase moisture in your home, reducing throat irritation.[17]",
                "Avoid straining your voice. If you're prone to frequent throat irritation, evaluate how you speak. Straining your voice can cause a sore throat, resulting in the build up of phlegm.[18]\n\nIf you have throat irritation, try to avoid coughing. Too much coughing can actually make an infection worse. If necessary, take over-the-counter cough suppressants or lozenges to ease irritation that leads to coughing.[19]\n\nAvoid screaming, shouting, or cheering. If you work in a field that requires you to talk loudly, make an effort to rest your voice at the end of the day. Speak softly and try not to raise your voice.[20]",
                "Do not clear your throat too often. Coughing, wheezing, and otherwise attempting to clear your throat can sometimes provide momentary relief. However, if you engage in these behaviors too frequently when you have a sore throat this can cause irritation. This could potentially increase the duration of symptoms. If you feel tempted to clear your throat, consider purchasing over-the-counter cough drops or lozenges at the drugstore to provide some relief.",
                "Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine can both increase dehydration, leading to a dry and irritated throat. Try to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol in excess. For men, limit your alcohol intake to two drinks a night. For women, try to stay around one drink.[21]",
                "Seek medical help. A sore or congested throat is not usually a medical concern and should clear up on its own. However, if you remain congested for more than two weeks see your doctor to rule out an underlying medical condition.\n\n\nKeep in mind that a sore throat and congestion are two separate symptoms that can result in worsening of each individual symptom. Congestion refers to nasal areas and sinus swelling increasing stuffy sensation, while a sore throat refers to pain in the throat. Post nasal drip and cough can worsen sore throats."

        "wikiHow to Hide Smoke Smell Indoors": {
            "intro": "Smoking is a very dangerous activity, yet many people of all ages smoke on a regular basis. While there are many health concerns that revolve around smoking, one of the most common day-to-day concerns people have about smoking is concealing the smell. Whether you live in a smoke-free apartment building or have roommates or family who do not approve of smoking, knowing how to effectively hide the smell of smoke can help you feel more at ease as you go about your day.",
            "steps": [
                "Ventilate the room. If you're going to smoke indoors and you're worried about others smelling your smoke, the best thing you can do to reduce smoke odors is ventilate the room. It won't solve the problem completely, but it will drastically improve the situation over smoking in an unventilated room.[1]\n\nClose the door to your room and open a window. You want to restrict smoke odors from traveling to other parts of the building while directing as much of the actual smoke as possible outside.[2]\n\nPut a fan in the window. Have it facing outside rather than towards you. This will help pull smoke out of the room and funnel it outdoors.[3]\n\nIf you're still actively smoking, blow all of your smoke through the back of the fan so that it gets sucked outside.[4]",
                "Mask the smell with other odors. Some air fresheners and scented candles are specifically designed to mask the smell of smoke. These products are usually available at smoke shops or online. Even if you don't have one of these specialized air fresheners or scented candles, any kind of odor-masking product may help cover up the smell of smoke.[5] However, it's best to stick with just one odor-masking element. Otherwise the room might just smell like a lot of different things and cigarette smoke.\n\n\nAir sanitizers like Ozium are believed to help neutralize odors like cigarette smoke.[6]\n\nFebreze can hide bad smells, possibly including cigarette smoke, because it contains hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), an active agent that traps, binds, and retains malodorous molecules.[7]\n\nCitrus is typically considered a good masking odor. If you have fresh oranges, even better: peel a few oranges in your room and leave the peels in strategic locations around your room while you wait for the odor to dissipate.[8]\n\nIncense, such as cedar wood, may help cover the smell of smoke.[9] However, burning incense may not be allowed in buildings with strict no-smoking policies.\nLeave out a bowl of white vinegar or ammonia. These powerful odors will help mask most odors, including smoke.[10] However, these products do not smell very good, and in the case of ammonia the fumes may be hazardous if left out for prolonged periods of time. You may also have some explaining to do if your roommate or building manager finds bowls of vinegar or ammonia lying around.\nDouse a rag with vanilla extract and hide it under a bed or chair. It should emit a strong vanilla odor which may help mask the smell of smoke.[11]",
                "Try an air purifier. Cigarette smoke particles are very small, and therefore most air purifiers do not effectively remove cigarette particles from the room. However, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and electronic air ionizers are designed to target small particles in the air.[12] Even these types of air purifiers will not completely solve the problem, but they may help reduce lingering odors caused by smoke when used in conjunction with other preventative measures.",
                "Grow a lot of plants. Plants help neutralize odors by absorbing particles from smoke and removing carbon monoxide and other chemicals from the air.[13] Having plants placed around your room can help freshen the air, and make the room look cheerier as well.\n\n\nSome of the best plants for improved air quality include philodendron, spider plants, English ivy, peace lily, daisies, and chrysanthemums.[14]",
                "Wash your walls. This may be a tedious chore if you are an everyday smoker, but one of the biggest odor traps in most household rooms is the walls.[15] If your walls can be wet-washed, a good scrub can help remove a significant portion of lingering smoke odors. Be cautious about scrubbing walls that cannot get wet, such as wall-papered walls or walls with certain types of paint, as moisture may damage these walls and ruin the design.\n\n\nUse a non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner to scrub the walls of your room. If you have an all-purpose cleaner with a strong odor, like lemon or citrus, that may be even more effective in hiding the smell of smoke.[16]\n\nVinegar can also be used to clean the walls, though again, you may have to explain the vinegar aroma clinging to your room. Mix one cup white vinegar with two cups of warm water, then add a generous scoop of baking soda. Use a mop, brush, or sponge to wash the walls and window moldings, and wipe it all down with a dry paper towel.[17]",
                "Clean the rug or flooring. In addition to walls, carpeting and flooring tend to absorb a considerable amount of smoke odors in an indoor environment. One easy way to help conceal some of the cigarette smells that may linger is by giving the floors in your room a thorough cleaning.[18] You can mop hardwood or tile floors with a scented cleaner like Murphy's Oil or Pine-Sol, or use a dry, granulated carpet cleaner/deodorizer on carpeted floors.[19]\n\nSprinkle the carpet cleaner/deodorizer generously across the carpet throughout the room, and let it sit for a while to absorb any lingering smells.[20]\n\nWhen it seems like the smell is fairly well-masked, use a vacuum to clean your entire room's carpeting.[21]\n\nIn a pinch, you can mask odors trapped in the carpet by mixing baking soda and a few drops of essential oil, such as lavender. Mix the liquid and powder together as much as you can, then sprinkle the carpet. Let it sit for about four hours (or as long as time permits), then vacuum up the powder.[22]",
                "Deodorize furniture. Furniture, especially soft-surfaced furniture like couches and bedding, tend to soak up odors in the environment. Spray-on products like Febreze are designed to help mask odors, though by some reports the odor-masking properties are only temporary, and may require repeat applications.[23]\n\nSpraying odor-masking products on furniture and/or carpeting may help reduce noticeable smoke odors, but will not completely eliminate most odors.[24]\n\nRubbing baking soda into a piece of furniture can also help neutralize odors. Let the baking soda sit for as long as possible (ideally overnight, though time constraints may not allow for this), then vacuum up all of the baking soda.[25] This method could even be done in conjunction with a spray-on odor-masking product.\nYou can clean and remove cigarette smells from hard-surface furniture, such as wood, the same way you do flooring; wipe down the piece of furniture with a scented cleaner.\nAlso try eliminating cigarette smells by wiping down your furniture with a cloth that is lightly dampened by all-purpose cleaner with bleach.",
                "Get rid of cigarette butts. This may sound like an obvious step, but it's important to remove any cigarette butts from your room if you want to avoid smoke odors.[26] Not only will stray cigarette butts provide solid evidence that you've been smoking, they will also leave a tell-tale odor behind.\n\n\nKeep your ashtray empty as often as possible.\nStray cigarette butts can emit a powerful odor long after the flame has been extinguished.[27]\n\nIf you are trying to hide your smoking from others who live in the same house as you, remember to dispose of cigarette butts in a place they won't be found or smelled.",
                "Change your clothes. Even if you've managed to thoroughly clean your room and mask the odors there, if you've been smoking, the smell will linger pretty noticeably on your clothes.[28] The best thing to do is to change your clothes immediately after smoking, and conceal those clothes in a contained environment, like a tied-up plastic bag.\n\n\nIf you aren’t able to change out of your clothes immediately, try spraying them down thoroughly with Lysol.",
                "Cover your breath. Much like clothing, a person's breath is a tell-tale sign of smoking. Anyone who has ever talked to or kissed a smoker will recall the prominent odor on the smoker's breath afterward. Fortunately, there are a number of options for covering the smell of cigarettes on your breath.\n\n\nEat something with a strong odor, like garlic or onions.[29] This should effectively mask the odor from your breath, as garlic and onions tend to overpower most other smells.\nFreshen your breath by brushing your teeth and using mouthwash.[30] This will give you the freshest breath possible, and will leave your mouth feeling clean.\nChew a strong mint. Breath mints are designed to mask odors by leaving a strong minty aroma in your mouth. This can even be done after you've brushed your teeth or eaten something with a strong odor. [31]",
                "Wash your hands. If you've been holding a burning cigarette for any length of time, there is a good chance that your hands will smell like cigarettes. Fortunately, if you're at home, you should be able to thoroughly wash your hands, ideally with a scented soap.[32]\n\nUse a scented soap to work up a good lather between your hands.[33] If you don't have scented soap, a scented shampoo or body wash will do.\nRinse your hands thoroughly, and repeat as necessary.[34]\n\nUse hand sanitizer and/or moisturizing lotion to help further cover up the smell after you've washed your hands.[35]",
                "Take a shower. Smoke tends to hang on people's hair and scalp due to the porous nature of our body's hair.[36] If at all possible, wash your hair and take a full shower after smoking to adequately hide the smell of smoke on your person.\n\n\nUse a coconut shampoo or other strongly-scented product to mask the odor on your hair and scalp.[37]\n\nUse a scented styling product after you shower to further ensure that your hair does not smell.[38]"

        "wikiHow to Get a Replacement Title for Your Car": {
            "intro": "In the event that your car title is stolen, or if the title becomes damaged or misplaced, you can obtain a replacement title from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or the bureau that governs motor vehicle registration in your state or local area. Although the process for obtaining a replacement title may vary slightly depending on where you reside, in most cases, you will be required to fill out an application for a new title and pay the applicable fees. Your state's DMV will then issue you a new car title by mail or in person.",
            "steps": [
                "Get an application online. In most states, you can print a copy of the application form directly from the website for your state's DMV.\n\n\nThe web site DMV.org is a useful, nationwide source of information. It is not connected to any state’s official department of motor vehicles, but it provides useful information, such as web sites, addresses and telephone numbers for each state’s official DMV. Go to DMV.org and select your state from the \"Choose Your State\" drop-down menu, or scroll below the map of the United States and click on the name of your state. You will then be taken to a page that contains links for your state's DMV website and the application for replacing your car title.[1]",
                "Get an application in person at the DMV. If you do not have Internet access, refer to your local phone directory or visit any full-service DMV office in person to obtain a copy of the application needed to replace your car title.",
                "Request an application by phone or by mail. If you prefer, you can usually call the DMV for your state and have an application mailed to you. Be sure to specify that you need the application for a lost or replacement title, as opposed to an original title for a new car. They will be different.",
                "Find out what you need for obtaining the replacement title. Most states will require you to pay fees and bring forms of personal identification and information specific to your car, such as insurance and registration. You can usually find out what you need very easily by checking your state’s DMV web site, or by calling the customer service number for your DMV.",
                "Find out about and prepare the required fee. Most states will charge a fee for replacing the Certificate of Title, but it will be nominal. In Texas, for example, if you apply by mail, the fee is $2; if you apply in person, it is $5.45.[2] In California, a replacement title is $20,[3] while in Massachusetts it is $25.[4] You will want to find out ahead of time what your state’s fee is.",
                "Have your registration and other identification ready. In order to request a duplicate title, in most states, you will have to show your driver’s license, or provide the driver’s license number if you are applying online. You will also need the car’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), which is usually available on your registration paperwork. Be careful to report the VIN precisely, as it is a long combination of numbers and letters. One mistake will delay your efforts to replace your title.[5]\n\nYou can also find the VIN on the car itself by looking for the metal tag in the far front left corner of the dashboard, just under the windshield.",
                "Complete the application form. The information you are required to provide will vary depending on your state's DMV policies. Be sure to provide all information carefully and accurately. The Certificate of Title is the single document that demonstrates your ownership of your car, and even minor errors can cause serious complications later if you want to sell or transfer the car. Application forms generally will ask for some or all of the following information:\n\n\nName (this should be printed exactly as it appears on your registration)\nAddress. The DMV in most states will only mail the new Certificate of Title to the address that is already on file in their records. If you are at a new address, you will first have to complete the procedure for changing your address.[6]\n\nContact information\nDriver’s license number",
                "Provide information that identifies your car. Most of the information that you will need for a duplicate title can be found in your registration or insurance paperwork. Some examples of typical requests are:\n\n\nVehicle Identification Number (VIN)\nLicense plate number\nYour car's make, model, and body color\nOriginal title number, if available\nCurrent odometer reading",
                "Provide lien-holder information, if applicable. In some states, the lien-holder may be required to be the one to submit the application.

                "Indicate your reason for requesting a replacement title. You can indicate whether your car title was lost, stolen, or damaged, or you may provide an alternate explanation.

Pay attention to word choice and sentence structure. Make it as good as possible, but remember that you’ll be able to fix any mistakes before you make your notes.",
                "Read the speech aloud. Sit down in a quiet place and read the speech to yourself. Notice any areas where you can make adjustments. Pay attention to the flow.

                "Write out information that needs to be exact. This includes statistics, quotations, and name pronunciations. If they are important to your speech, they're worth writing out. You may need to write them on a separate notecard. This ensures they're legible, but make sure you indicate when you need to read them.\n\n\nFor instance, write down “75% pass” if you need to inform your audience how many people pass a class.",
                "Color-code your notes with highlights. Get a couple of different highlighting markers from a general store. Assign each color a purpose. For instance, green can be for main ideas. Pink can be for supporting examples. Yellow can be for examples. Orange can be for quotations or transitions. These colors are useful for keeping your thoughts in order.\n\n\nCustomize the color code to whatever works best for you.",
                "Number the notes. Go back and get all your cards in their final order. In one of the corners, mark the cards or pages with the number order. The keyword that comes up first in your speech should be number one. Number the rest of the cards so that you’ll be able to avoid mixing them up.[8]\n\nYou can also bind the cards together. Use a drill or hole punch on the upper left corner of the notes. Loop a string through them. They’ll be easy to flip and can’t be mixed up.",
                "Mark your notes with timing details. Some speeches have time limits. You can time out your speech so you know when you need to get to certain points. When your timing is off, you’ll know you need to change your pace or eliminate some speaking points. Also include related reminders, such as directions to smile, breathe, or use a prop at certain points.\n\n\nFor example, if you need to introduce your second idea at the three minute mark, write three minutes on the card containing that idea.",
                "Rehearse the full speech. Go ahead and recite your speech until you remember all the important parts. You don’t need to memorize every word of the speech. The crucial points you need to convey to the audience are what you should know by heart. Read the speech aloud, focusing on controlling your speech and movements so you sound natural.[9]\n\nMemorizing a speech word-for-word is unhelpful because the audience can tell that you’re reciting a script. Speakers who do this often sound flat.",
                "Practice the speech with your notes. Put aside your script and pick up your notes. Attempt to deliver your speech. This time, use your notes when you get stuck. Continue to adjust your speech patterns and movements to make them sound natural.[10]\n\nBecause you are using a minimal outline, your speech will sound a little different every time. However, it’ll also sound more natural.",
                "Master your speech. Rehearse the speech until you know what to do and feel comfortable referring to your notes. You can ask your friends and family to listen again. They’ll be impressed with how well you perform. You’ll also feel more confident because you’re prepared.[11]\n\nYou can time yourself again while giving the speech. It can show you when you’re going off-script too much."

            "intro": "Dogs and panting go hand in hand. You may notice your dog panting with his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. Since dogs don't sweat like humans do, panting is how a dog cools himself down. In healthy dogs, panting is a normal part of running or playing hard, especially if he is excited, anxious, or somewhere warm.[1] In unusual cases (often caused by medical conditions), your dog's panting may be heavy or labored. Either way, learn how to relieve your dog's panting.",
            "steps": [
                "Give your dog water. If you're sure your dog is healthy, he may be panting because he's thirsty and overheated. Offer your dog cool, not ice cold, water. If the water is too cold, your dog may find it uncomfortable and stop drinking.\n\n\nIf you're exercising with your dog, periodically give him water breaks.[2]\n\nTo prevent your dog from gulping too much water, try to give him water from a water bottle. Drinking slowly can prevent stomach cramps.[3]",
                "Put your dog in a quiet, cool environment. If your dog is overheating, you should put him in a cool place that has air conditioning or a room that has a fan running. If you have the option, let your dog go for a dip in the pool or lake. Once your dog seems to have cooled off and isn't panting as much, offer him water again.[4]\n\nConsider dipping a towel in water, wringing it out, and draping it over your dog. This will cool him off, especially after exercising in a warm environment.[5]",
                "Calm your dog. If your dog is overexcited or anxious, take charge and calm him down. If you’re worried or panicked, your dog will feed off your emotions so don't appear nervous. Instead, comfort your dog by talking to him in a soothing voice while petting him.[6]\n\nYou may be able to distract your dog from what's worrying him. Try giving him a small treat or his favorite toy to play with.",
                "Check for signs of severe dehydration. If your dog has been in a hot environment and is panting heavily, he may be overheated. Check to see if his gums are beet red or pale. If so, get your dog to a cool place with a fan on him and offer cool water.[7]\n\nIf your dog doesn't stop panting or acts weak, take him to the veterinarian.",
                "Consider your dog's overall health. Your dog may pant heavily to flush his body of toxic substances if he has chronic health problems, like heart or lung disease. If your dog is obese, he's more likely to pant heavily because of heat exhaustion. This is because the extra fat and energy required to carry the weight makes your dog work harder.\n\n\nIf you have an older dog who suddenly pants more when he does average physical activities or when he's laying down, make an appointment to have him examined.[8]",
                "Treat your dog for heat exhaustion or fever. Your dog may pant heavily if his body temperature rises externally (in hot weather) or internally (by fever due to illness or infection). In these cases, he'll pant to rid his body of this heat. If your dog has heat exhaustion or a fever over 102.5 degrees, immediately call the veterinarian. Your veterinarian should tell you what steps you'll need to take before bringing your dog in for medical treatment.[9]\n\nTo take your dog's temperature use a rectal thermometer, or an ear thermometer if your dog will tolerate it. Never take an oral (mouth) temperature since it won't be accurate.",
                "Know when to get medical attention. Take your dog to the veterinarian if you notice heavy panting and:[10]\n\nPain from arthritis\nPain from abdominal problems like bloat or pancreatitis\nPain from an injury\nFever over 102.5 degrees\nPanting that lasts more than 10 minutes\nA bluish purple or very pale mouth or tongue\n\nSee the vet immediately if your dog has bloat, pancreatitis, colored or pale mouth or tongue, and heavy breathing.",
                "Consider less common causes of heavy panting. Occasionally, some medical conditions or medications may cause your dog to pant heavily. Consult with your veterinarian if you suspect one of the following is causing the heavy panting:\n\n\nCushing’s disease: This hormonal disease causes your dog to produce too much cortisol.[11] Panting is one of the minor signs of this disease, while a pot belly and increased eating, drinking, and urination are more common symptoms.\nMedication: Some medications such as steroids (like prednisone) can cause your dog to pant.[12]\n\nPregnancy and related conditions: If your dog is pregnant, the added weight can cause her to pant heavily, especially by the end of pregnancy. Milk fever (eclampsia) in nursing mothers can also lead cause heavy panting. Calcium levels in the blood stream plummet when the milk demand for calcium becomes too high.[13]"

        "How to Prevent Jeans from Fading in the Wash": {
            "intro": "Blue and black jeans tend to fade in the washing machine. The water and soap erodes the dye and discolors them. Jeans will fade regardless, but washing them carefully can help slow the process. Use mild detergents and do not wash your jeans often. Treat stains with household cleaners instead of throwing your jeans in the machine. Make sure to hang your jeans to dry in an area away from sunlight.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash jeans infrequently. Jeans do not actually need to be washed as regularly as other clothing items. In fact, washing jeans too often can cause them to fade prematurely.[1]\n\nYou really only need to machine wash jeans once ever 4 to 6 weeks. If you notice any stains during this time frame, you can spot clean with household cleaners rather than throwing the jeans in the wash.",
                "Turn the jeans inside out prior to washing. This should be a standard practice each time you throw a pair of jeans in with the laundry. Turning the jeans inside out will prevent detergent from wearing as harshly on the dye. Jeans washed inside out will maintain more of their color.[2]",
                "Use a color preserving detergent or vinegar. If you notice your jeans seem to fade a bit with each wash, use a color protectant detergent. You can buy this at most supermarkets or department stores. You can also opt not to use detergent at all. Vinegar can be used as replacement and may better preserve the color of your jeans.[3]\n\nDetergent is meant to eliminate stains but often does not differentiate between stains and dye. Vinegar, on the other hand, will make for a milder wash, cleaning your jeans without removing dye.\nVinegar has a strong smell, however. If you have a sensitive nose, using vinegar may be a bad idea.",
                "Wash jeans with other garments. Jeans tend to fade less when washed with other dark clothing. Dark dyes can fade in the wash and swirl around with other clothes. If clothing is packed in together, less dye will fade out. Wait until you have a lot of dark clothes that need washing before washing your jeans.[4]",
                "Use the lowest spin cycle and temperature. Jeans require a gentle wash and low temperatures to prevent fading. Set your washer for the slowest spin cycle possible and the lowest temperature water. If there's an option for a gentle wash or a hand wash on your washing machine, use it.[5]",
                "Let jeans air dry when possible. If you have somewhere to hang your jeans to dry, do so. Jeans fade less when hung up to dry.[6]\n\nTo prevent wrinkling, hang jeans up by the belt loops.",
                "Use dryers only at the lowest heat settings possible. If you need to use a dryer for any reason, such as needing the jeans dry right away, use the lowest heat setting possible. The higher the heat setting, the more likely the jeans are to fade.[7]",
                "Keep your jeans away from direct sunlight when hanging them. Never dry jeans outside on a clothing rack. Direct sunlight can cause jeans to fade. Always dry jeans inside, away from open windows or other sources of direct sunlight.[8]",
                "Mist instead of washing on occasion. If your jeans get dirty or start to smell, do not immediately throw them back in the wash. You can mist the jeans to remove an unwanted smell instead. You should only wash jeans every 4 to 5 weeks.[9]\n\nTake a spray bottle. Fill it up halfway with cold water and halfway with vodka.\nMist your jeans and then place them in the freezer overnight to reduce the smell.",
                "Set the dye before washing black jeans. When you first buy black jeans, you should set the dye once before washing them. To set the dye, fill a bath with cold water, one cup of vinegar, and one tablespoon of salt.[10]\n\nSoak your jeans in the bath, both inside and out. This will set the dye before you wash your jeans.",
                "Remove stains with household cleaners. Small stains can be spot cleaned with household cleaners. This prevents the need to wash black jeans each time they get slightly dirty.[11]\n\nPine sol can easily be used to remove grease. In the event of a paint stain, dab it off with Mötsenböcker’s Lift Off.",
                "Use gentle settings when washing them. In the event you need to wash your jeans, use the most gentle settings on your washer possible. Use cold water and cycles like \"hand wash\" or \"gentle wash.\" This will prevent the color from fading.[12]",
                "Do not dry black jeans. Never put black jeans in a dryer. Always hang them up by their belt loops to dry. Make sure to keep them out of direct sunlight.[13]"

            "intro": "Also called \"fried marbles,\" these beauties have a network of shattered glass inside them. These are just ordinary marbles heated to make the glass expand, then cooled rapidly. The outside of the glass shrinks as it cools, which collides with the hot, expanded interior to crack it.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Choose your marbles. You can use any clear, mono-color marbles, or marbles with a cat's eye pattern. Opaque marbles won't look any different when cracked, and two-tone marbles will just crack in half.[2][3] You may want to start with five or six marbles to make sure you like the effect.\n\n\nYou can use \"flat marbles\" and other decorative glass pieces as well, but they have a higher chance of breaking.[4]",
                "Place the marbles in an oven or toaster oven. Lay the marbles in a single layer on a baking tray with raised edges. Use a stainless steel pan, not one with a nonstick surface.[5]",
                "Bake at 180ºC for 20 minutes. If your oven uses Fahrenheit, set it to 350º instead.\n\n\nSome craftspeople prefer heating as high as 260ºC (500ºF).",
                "Set up a bowl of ice water. Fill a bowl with cold water, plus enough ice to keep it chilled.",
                "Transfer the hot marbles to the ice water. Remove the marbles from the oven carefully with oven mitts. Without touching the hot glass, use a spoon or other utensil to place them gently in the bowl of water.\n\n\nWarning: although unlikely, the hot glass could explode on contact with the water. Do not put your face over the bowl, and wear safety glasses if you'd like extra protection.",
                "Wait until the marbles crack. You should immediately hear a hissing or crackling noise when the marbles enter the water. Within a minute or so, the inside of the marbles will crack.",
                "Inspect the marbles. The marbles will cool within a couple minutes, so you can take them out by hand. Some of the marbles may have cracked apart, but most will be smooth on the outside, with cracked patterns on the inside.\n\nIf some of the marbles only have tiny cracks, you can dry them off and repeat the process to get more cracks.[6]",
                "Make a cracked marble necklace. Glue a bell cap onto a cracked marble using E6000 glue or another high strength glue that adheres to glass. Wait until it dries completely, then push a jump ring onto the ring of the bell cap. You can now fit a necklace chain onto the jump ring.[7]\n\nUse needle-nose pliers for greater control. You may need two pairs of pliers, so you can grip both sides of the split jump ring and rock them back and forth to \"walk\" over the necklace chain.\nFind a glue tube with a long nozzle for precise control.[8]",
                "Paint flat marbles with nail polish. This adds an even more colorful sparkle when the polish reflects through the cracks in the glass. Simply coat the flat side of the marble with nail polish and let dry before using in rings or other jewelry. You may need two or three coats, depending on the opacity of the nail polish.[9]",
                "Turn flat marbles into rings. You can easily glue cracked flat marbles onto a ring base with E6000 glue. To make your own ring base, wrap two wires around a ring mandrel, or any object the same size as your finger. Secure them by wrapping around the ring setting, then spiral the rings around each other to create a flat surface for your marble to rest on. Finish by tucking the wires around the ring beneath.[10]",
                "Make wire-wrapped jewelry. You don't need much practice to make a wire cage. Just make three or four wire loops, and bunch them together at the top by wrapping the ends of a piece of wire tightly around them. Push the marble into the center of the cage, then use pliers and wire cutters to make adjustments and loop the wire around jump rings or other jewelry components.[11]\n\nIf you enjoy this look, there are all kinds of techniques you can learn.

        "How to Make Money Creating Teaser Blogs": {
            "intro": "Teaser blogs are snippets of blogs, typically leads, that pique the reader's interest, and that are placed on multiple websites to entice as many readers as possible to click through to the full blog post. The trick to making money creating teaser blogs is that the page that the full blog is posted on contains advertisements for companies that pay a small amount for either each view of or each click on the advertisement. Though this is usually no more than $0.05 each, when hundreds of people per day see an ad or click on one, the total amount of money for the writer of the blog can add up significantly. If you're a skilled writer and have some knowledge of how Internet traffic and e-commerce work, read the following steps to learn how to make money creating teaser blogs.",
            "steps": [
                "Create your own blog. There are a number of user-friendly sites that are free, such as Wordpress and Blogger, where you can start your own blog.\n\n\nRemember to link your other social networking accounts, and your website if you have one, to your blog to encourage people to visit it.\nWhen choosing a title for your blog, make sure it's both catchy and expresses what your blog is about.",
                "Create blog posts. Blog posts are short articles, typically between 200 and 500 words, and can be on any topic you choose. To attract readers, it's best to choose subjects that are useful, entertaining or informative and that you possess adequate expertise to write about authoritatively. Your goal is to generate interest and attract as many readers as possible.",
                "Sign up for affiliate accounts with affiliate programs. Affiliate programs are advertising programs organized by companies, in which an affiliate receives a payment for every view of or click on an advertisement for the company. Choose affiliate programs that advertise products related to the topics you wish to write about.\n\n\nChoosing advertisements related to your topic increases the chances that readers will be interested enough to view and click the ads.",
                "Download the advertisements from each company's affiliate page. Choose which you want to add to your blog page and add them by following the blog site's instructions. Link the advertisements to the appropriate websites by typing the link into the field provided to add a hyperlink. Click on the \"Publish\" button on your blog to see if all advertisements are displayed correctly, then test the links by clicking on each advertisement to see if it takes you to the desired page.",
                "Find websites that allow you to post teaser blogs. Blogcarnival is a site that allows you to post teasers, and you can also post teasers on other bloggers' websites and on social networking sites. Look for sites that offer other blog teasers and excerpts, or sites that allow you to post comments for free.\n\n\nMake sure the sites don't require content to be unique, meaning it's only published on 1 website. This way, you can use 1 teaser blog for as many sites as you like to generate maximum traffic.",
                "Select the \"teaser\" part of your blog by copying it and posting it on the websites of your choice, like Blogcarnival. Follow the site's instructions on how to post if you need help. The teaser should be 1 or 2 lines from your blog that indicate what the blog is about and intrigue a reader so that he clicks on the link to read the full article.",
                "Build traffic. Traffic is key to making money creating teaser blogs. The best way to generate it is by publishing a lot of blog posts and using keywords that people search for on the Internet. This will enhance the chances of readers selecting your blog post when they're looking for information.\n\n\nYou can find out what keywords are popular by generating a word search on Google Adwords to find out how often they're searched. Use words that relate to your blogs.",
                "Concentrate on the best paying advertisers and the ones people click through to most. The companies that pay best are the ones that offer the highest amount per view or per click. You can review the pay amount, as well as the number of visitors to a site by checking your account information on each company's affiliate page. This way, you're maximizing the time you spend on selecting topics to write about and pages to link to.",
                "Wait for income to generate. Though you might see some income in your first month, you'll probably have to blog for at least 6 months to see any real returns.",
                "Increase traffic to your blogs by writing posts on other bloggers' websites and signing up for blog community sites. Networking with other bloggers is a great way to generate more visitors, as bloggers often exchange links to send traffic to each other websites."

        "wikiHow to Break Up with Your Boyfriend if You Are in Love with Him": {
            "intro": "Breaking up with someone you love is hard, but with the right attitude and a lot of confidence, you will be able to burn the fire out. Ultimately, you need to be willing to put your own health, happiness, and future first. If that future doesn't contain your man, then it is time to end things with him, even if you still have feelings.",
            "steps": [
                "Ask why you want to break-up with him. Breaking up with someone is hard. It is no easier when you still have feelings for him. However, sometimes relationships stall, grow apart, and become difficult to manage due to time or space apart. You can be in love with someone and still feel like you need to move on to a new stage of your life. If you're considering a break-up, ask yourself a few questions about yourself and the relationship. If you say no to most of the following, it may be time to move on:\n\n\nDo you only want to break up because of present circumstances, like a recent fight or money troubles? If not, is it because of long-term problems?\nDo you have second thoughts about breaking up, or have you been sure of your decision for a few weeks?\nIf your partner asked you for a second chance, would you say yes?\nDo you see your partner in your life 6 months from now?[1]",
                "Write down a list of reasons why you want to break up. No doubt it may be hard, but if you get down your reasons down on paper, it makes it easier to convince yourself you need to get through with this. Don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings -- this paper is for you and you only. Brainstorm why you need to end things, considering the following reasons:\n\n\nYou can't give him the love he deserves. You may need to move for a new job, want to spend more time with your family, or have a hard time supporting his needs. If you truly love him but know that you can't/don't want be there for him, it's time to end it.\nYou've fallen in love with someone else. Unfortunately, you can't really control who you love. If you've got deep feelings for another, you need to end things with your current man before moving on.\nYou don't see yourself spending the rest of your life with him. This is especially important if he seems to plan his future around you. End things now instead of hoping you change your mind -- it won't happen.\nYou're unhappy. If the bad times outweigh the good, and the relationship weighs on your mind each day, it's time to move on. This isn't a phase -- this is relationship that has begun to go sour.[2]",
                "Look over your reasons one week later. Read your reasons for needing to break up with him and see if they still feel true. Did you dash that list off in the spur of the moment, or do you still feel the same way seven days later. If you're still sure of your decision to break-up, you've made the right one.",
                "Look ahead to an independent lifestyle, not at the temporary pain a break up will bring. Many people stay in relationships for too long because they're afraid of the emotional whiplash being alone will bring. You may understand that you'll be better in the long run, but the short-term pain makes breaking up seem unbearable. However, you've got to rip off the bandage sometimes, and it will get easier if you remind yourself of several key things:\n\n\nYou will not be alone forever. Being single does not mean you'll never find love again, even if it feels like you'll never find another \"perfect\" man.\nIndependence will make you stronger. Being alone is hard, but it forces you to grow in unexpected and important ways. You do not need your guy to be strong and happy.[3]",
                "Remind yourself why you love him to ensure you're making the right decision. This may be one of the hardest things to do, especially if you've committed to ending the relationship, but you need to consider the good with the bad. Jot down why you love him, the reasons you're together, and the good times you've had. Remember, you will always have these memories, no matter what happens between you. If you make it through this trip down memory lane, but still know that it would be best to end things, then you'll know for sure that you've made the right decision.\n\n\nRemember, it may be best to break up even if you still have feelings for him. You just want to be sure that the bad outweighs the good.",
                "Prioritize your health and happiness. The final hurdle to a break-up is often your worries about other people. What will our friends think? What will my parents think? How will we sort out our stuff? Most importantly, how will he feel? However, all of these worries are unimportant in comparison to your own happiness and emotional well-being. While this sounds selfish, it is ultimately the most thoughtful perspective you can adopt. If you're in a relationship that isn't working, you're going to take it out on each other with fights and arguments. Friends and family may get dragged in, and worries about your stuff can turn into possessiveness and secrecy. When you're ready to end things, all that matters is your decision to break up. The rest of the details will work themselves out.[4]\n\nSometimes a gut feeling -- \"This just isn't working\" -- is a perfectly acceptable reason for breaking up. Remember that you're doing this for you, not someone else.",
                "End things quickly once you've made you decision. Know that if you don't break up with him right now - and you keep delaying - the situation you are in may grow worse in the future. You'll regret not taking action while you could have, and end up wasting both his time and yours in a meaningless relationship. It may hurt right now, but once you get this over with, you'll be happy you did. Once you go through with it, both parties can move on, but not before.\n\n\nRemember -- it is better to be happy alone than miserable on your own.[5]",
                "Call your boyfriend and ask him to meet you somewhere calm and quiet. Be sure it is an area with few people where you can have an open, honest conversation. Let him know that you need to have a conversation about your relationship, but try not to elaborate on the phone. Still, preparing him, at least a little bit, is common courtesy.\n\n\nRefrain from breaking up with your boyfriend on a date. You should make time to end things instead of trying to tack it onto an otherwise happy night.[6]",
                "Move right into the breakup after you've greeted each other. Avoid beating around the bush, as this will only aggravate you and increase tension. You may also lose courage and change your mind. Breaking up takes 30 seconds of intense, extreme courage. But, at the end of the day, it's only 30 seconds.\n\n\nTake a deep breath and count to three in your head. Know that, when you get to \"zero,\" it's time to break up with him.",
                "Use direct, unambiguous language. If you're breaking up with him, you need to make it clear that you're breaking up. Do not leave him guessing or open up the floor for conversation. If you've made your decision, it's time to move on. Make sure he knows that you still love him and would love to be good friends, but you can't continue this relationship any longer. There are some good conversation starters in the guides below for specific breakups, but the main idea is to end things with simple and direct language:\n\n\n\"I'm ready to move on from our relationship.\"\n\"It's time we saw other people.\"\n\"I think we should break up.\"[7]",
                "Avoid getting angry, pointing fingers, or assigning blame. Breaking up is hard enough without having a fight or argument. You may have a laundry list of reasons to break up with him, but that doesn't mean you need to point out all of his flaws and the problems in the relationship. That just adds insult to injury, and it can lead to a fight or argument that makes everyone feel even worse (\"what do you mean I didn't support you -- I always support you!\" or, \"That's not my fault, it's your fault for moving away!\"). That said, he'll likely ask you why you are doing this, and it is best to have a calm, truthful, but non-judgmental answer ready.\n\n\n\"I've realized that we're growing apart. We've grown together for so long, and I cherish all of the time, but I need time to grow on my own now.\"\n\"I don't feel like we treat each other with the respect we used to. Some of that is my fault. But we still need to move on to people who will treat us how we deserve.\"",
                "Stand by your decision, no matter what he says. If he's still in love, he may ask for a second chance, come up with a way to salvage things (like a temporary break), or convince you to change your mind. But once you've made your decision, you need to stick with it. Remember, what he says now will not change your relationship, or the problems that led you to break up.\n\n\n\"I understand, but I think we need to go our separate ways.\"\n\"I don't want to take a break and leave things uncertain. We need to break up.\"",
                "Leave once you've said all you need to say. To soften the blow a little, give him a gentle hug and leave. Don't linger or wait to see what his reaction will be like - you want to avoid tangling yourself up in the emotional fallout of the relationship. Know that this is going to hurt, and there is no way to make it easy or perfect. You will not be happy with each other in the immediate aftermath, no matter how long you stay or what you say. The best thing to do is leave politely.[8]",
                "Remind yourself your reasons for ending things when you miss him. It's not easy breaking up. However, know that your reasons are right and that it's not you - it's him. Convince yourself you have done the right thing. Although you have completed your mission, you still may feel hurt and angry. The recovery process will depend on how much you love him, but don't worry - you will feel better one day soon.\n\n\nMissing him does not change any of your issues and it is not a reason to get back together. Your bigger issues, the ones you broke up over, will still be there when the dust settles.",
                "Separate yourself completely for the foreseeable future. Once you've let go of the one you love, it's going to hurt. You'll miss him at random times, feel like you've made a mistake, and want his advice on what to do next. But you have to resist the urge to text, call, or see him. You can move on and get your life back together, but only if you commit to moving on. Resist the urge to talk to him and work on sorting through your emotions on your own. It will be difficult, but you'll be able to do it with time.[9]\n\nYou may be able to be friends one day, but that day is in the future. You need to be completely over your romantic feelings, and the only way to get there is to not see each other.\nPacking away photos and items that bring painful memories is a good way to start the healing process.",
                "Try something new. As painful as a breakup can be, it also comes with a sense of liberation. You no longer need to make decisions for two -- you can make them only by yourself. You'll notice you have a lot more free time all of a sudden, and events and activities that were difficult to coordinate with a partner are now easily available. Don't spend your time trying to recreate the feeling you had in a relationship -- go out and try something new. Enjoy your newfound liberation and explore the single world.[10]\n\nDo things for you. Take the time to take care of yourself for a bit.",
                "Turn to your friends and family for support. Having a great network of other people reminds you that, even without a boyfriend, you are not alone. Spend your time with other people you love to help heal the inevitable hole in your heart.\n\n\nWhen you feel like calling or texting your ex-boyfriend, call your best friend instead. Let them know, briefly, that you are still kicking old habits chat out your problems.\nMost people are happy to help you move on, but that doesn't mean they want to hear about your ex-boyfriend all day. Avoid bringing him up, instead moving on to other topics.[11]"

            "intro": "Despite the name, ringworm isn’t really caused by a worm. It is caused by a fungus, but forms a ring-like rash. It can be an uncomfortable condition, and it is common in children. Learn how to treat it so you can reduce the spread of the infectious condition.",
            "steps": [
                "Use an over-the-counter cream or powder. Most mild cases of ringworm can be treated with over-the-counter cream or powder medications, such as clotrimazole, tolnaftate, miconazole, and terbinafine. You can buy these medications at a drugstore, or you can take your child to the pediatrician to get a recommendation.[1]\n\nYou can apply the cream two or three times a day for about one to two weeks.\nIf the rash is spreading or doesn’t get any better, take your child to the pediatrician.",
                "Get an oral antifungal. If your child’s ringworm doesn’t get better after using at-home or over-the-counter remedies, your pediatrician may prescribe an oral antifungal medication. These medications are stronger and work to kill the fungus. If you are given a tablet or liquid medicine, it spreads through your body to help kill the fungus.[2]\n\nYour child may need to take the medication for a few weeks.\nOral medication may be needed for people who have ringworm of the scalp or the nails.[3] This usually requires six weeks to several months of treatment.",
                "Use a special shampoo. If your child has ringworm on the scalp, which is common in toddlers and young children, you can use a special shampoo to help treat the scalp and prevent the spread of ringworm.[4]\n\nAny other family members who may have caught the ringworm should use the shampoo. They should also examine themselves for any other signs of ringworm.",
                "Take your child to the doctor. Most ringworm infections can be treated with at-home remedies. If there is no improvement within one week after using OTC or herbal remedies, it is still spreading after a week, or lasts longer than a month, call your physician for advice. Ringworm is annoying, but it is not dangerous, just contagious.[5]\n\nContact your doctor immediately if pus is draining from the ringworm spots.\nYou should also contact your doctor if the ringworm is on the scalp or there are more than three spots of ringworm.\nRemember that ringworm is very contagious, so make certain your child stays away from close contact with any other children until after they begin treatment. Change your child’s bedsheets daily and reserve a bath towel just for your child until the rash disappears.\nKids with ringworm can got to school or daycare after they begin treatment. Cover any areas of the skin that have ringworm if you can to reduce the chance of spread.",
                "Try garlic. Garlic has antifungal properties due to two of its components, ajoene and allicin.[6][7] At least one study has indicated that garlic is more effective than terbinafine in treating ringworm.[8]\n\nTry crushing two to three cloves of garlic, or more if the rash is more extensive, and mixing the crushed garlic with a carrier oil, such as castor or almond oil. Apply this mixture directly onto the rash and leave on for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash the mixture off with warm water and reapply two to three times a day. There may be a strong odor. If any irritation occurs, try changing the carrier oil. If this doesn’t help, you may need to use less garlic or try another method.\nAnother method is to use garlic oil. Add four to five drops of garlic oil to four tablespoons of a carrier oil. Apply the oil directly onto the rash. Leave on for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. Apply two to three times a day.",
                "Use tea tree oil. The Australian tea tree leaves produce an oil that has, among other benefits, antifungal activity, including activity against the fungus that causes ringworm.[9][10] For younger children under the age of 5, take extra precautions that they don’t ingest any tea tree oil by putting their mouths anywhere near the rash.\n\n\nDilute the tea tree oil with either castor or almond oil in a 1:1 ratio. For example, if you are using one teaspoon of tea tree oil, dilute with one teaspoon of carrier oil.\nApply this mixture directly onto the rash and leave for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash off with warm water and reapply two to three times a day. There may be a strong, but not unpleasant, odor.\nIf any irritation occurs, decrease the amount of tea tree oil. For every teaspoon of tea tree oil, use two teaspoons of carrier oil. Try changing the carrier oil. If this doesn’t help, you may need to try another method.",
                "Consider apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is used for many, many health problems. Part of its usefulness is due to its acidity. The ringworm fungus doesn’t thrive in acidic environments.\n\n\nTry the ACV on a small area of skin first to make sure your skin isn’t sensitive to it. If there is no reaction, try ACV to treat ringworm.\nSoak a washcloth or towel in ACV and apply it directly to the ringworm rash for 30 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and repeat twice a day. There may be some a mild stinging sensation with the ACV is first applied.",
                "Try lavender oil. Lavender oil has antifungal properties, and is used in folk medicine for treating fungal infections and skin conditions.[11] This method is recommended especially for children. Most kids love the scent of lavender, and it has the added benefit of having a calming effect on most kids.\n\n\nMix one to two drops of lavender oil in one tablespoon of castor or jojoba oil. Apply this mixture directly onto the rash and leave on for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash off with warm water. Reapply two to three times a day.\nIf any irritation occurs, decrease the amount of lavender oil. Use only one drop for every tablespoon of oil or use one to two drops of lavender oil for every two to threes tablespoons of castor or jojoba oil.\nA recent study indicated that a very effective approach to ringworm was to mix tea tree oil and lavender oil.[12] To do this, add two drops of lavender oil to two tablespoons of tea tree oil. Dilute this mixture by adding two tablespoons of castor, almond, or jojoba oil. Apply this mixture for 20 to 30 minutes and rinse off with warm water. Repeat two to three times a day.",
                "Use coconut oil. Coconut oil has antifungal properties as well as antimicrobial and antiviral properties. The antifungal properties are due to the medium chain fatty acids (MCFA), which have been found to kill many different kinds of fungi.[13]\n\nBuy coconut oil that is not hydrogenated and is unrefined.\nApply the coconut oil directly onto the ringworm, or put it on a cotton ball and then apply to the ringworm. Use a cotton ball to massage the coconut oil into the spot. Leave overnight.[14]\n\nDo this daily.",
                "Learn what ringworm is. Ringworm is a fungal infection of the skin. The name comes from the circular rashes it causes. On the skin, ringworm shows up as red patches of skin with a central paler area. Ringworm can occur on various parts of the body.\n\n\nOn the head, this fungal infection shows up as round patches of hair loss and skin is often scaly.\nThe medical term for ringworm is Tinea. Ringworm on the body is called tinea corporis while ringworm on the scalp is called tinea capitis. Jock itch, which is a fungal infection of the genital area, is called tinea cruris. Athlete’s foot is known as tinea pedis.[15]\n\nRingworm is commonly caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. Other fungus that may cause ringworm are microsporum, and epidermophyton.[16]",
                "Learn the conditions for ringworm. Ringworm is common in children, especially children under 15. However, it can occur in anyone. It is a very contagious condition.\n\n\nRisk factors for ringworm include damp, humid conditions, having close contact with an infected person, involvement in sports where close contact is common and wearing restrictive clothing.[17]\n\nRingworm can also affect dogs and cats, and they can pass the infections to their humans.[18]",
                "Recognize the symptoms for ringworm. Ringworm infections look very distinct with the red outer edges and paler center. Ringworm often feels itchy and can also exhibit swelling.\n\n\nThe round, reddish border can be slightly raised. The rash is often scaly.\nBecause of the itchiness, excessive scratching can occur. Because of the scratching, scarring can sometimes result."

        "How to Teach Your Dog Tricks": {
            "intro": "Teaching your dog to do tricks is a fun extension of basic obedience training. Indeed, similar principles apply to teaching tricks. Dogs thrive on the one-to-one attention they get from an owner during training sessions, and they also benefit from the mental stimulation. If you want to teach your dog some basic tricks or something more advanced, learn about reward based training and get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Focus on reward-based training. Reward based training uses treats, praise, toys, and play as motivators to teach your dog new behaviors. This method of training teaches your dog that if he does what you want then he gets a reward. Reward based training is the best way to teach your dog new things because it is effective, simple, and it enhances your relationship.[1]\n\nDo not use punishment as a training method. Older methods of obedience training rely on harsh treatment to train new behaviors, such as yanking on a choke chain. In this type of training, dogs behave out of fear, rather than making new connections between rewards and behaviors. Punishment based training is not advised because it can lead to other problems, such as anxiety and a poor relationship between you and your dog.[2]",
                "Identify your dog’s ideal reward. Reward based training works best if you know what motivates your dog. Common rewards include tiny pieces of food and special dog treats, but you can also use praise or reward your dog with a game or a special toy.[3]\n\nUsing reward-based training is simple. When the dog performs an action that you wish him to repeat, then acknowledge the good behavior and give your dog his treat right away.",
                "Reward your dog immediately. The timing of the reward is crucial because it helps your dog understand what behavior is being rewarded. Therefore, it is important to give your dog his reward at the exact same moment that your dog performs the desired behavior.\n\n\nFor example, when teaching a dog to sit, you should give the reward as soon as his behind touches the ground. This will ensure that he knows he is being rewarded for sitting down.[4]",
                "Use a clicker to mark good behavior. A popular way to mark good behavior is to use a clicker. When the dog is learning a new action, the clicker works better than offering praise or a treat. Dogs are used to hearing us talk, so he may not associate your talking with his action. However, the clicker is a novel sound that your dog will hear only during training sessions, so it will help him know what he is supposed to do.[5]\n\nTo use a clicker, you will first need to train your dog to understand that the click-clack sound means a reward is on the way. You can do this by clicking the clicker and then giving your dog a food reward at the same time. Do this several times and your dog will begin to understand that the clicking sound means a treat is on the way.",
                "Teach your dog to associate the clicker with a command. Use the clicker to get your dog to associate the sound of the clicker with commands as well. Command your dog to sit and click the clicker at the same time that you say sit. Repeat this exercise a few times to reinforce the connection between the clicker and the sit command.[6]\n\nAlways choose brief command words, preferably with a harsh first syllable such as \"Sit\" or \"Stay\". This is because only listen to the first one or two syllables and a harsh sound is easier to hear than a soft one.",
                "Consider establishing basic commands first. It is helpful to have a solid foundation of \"Sit\", \"Stay\", and \"Come\", before moving onto tricks, but it is not absolutely necessary. If you have a young puppy or just want to have fun, then don't be afraid to try some tricks.[7]",
                "Teach your dog to yawn. To teach your dog to yawn, carry a clicker and treats with you at all times. Watch your dog like a hawk and when he yawns of his own accord, immediately click when he is in mid yawn. Then, let him finish yawning and reward him. Try to catch your dog yawning as often as you can and mark and reward the behavior. After a few times, start to label the behavior as \"Yawn.” Soon your dog will understand the connection and will begin to yawn on command.[8]",
                "Teach your dog to spin in a circle. A more complex trick that you can teach your dog is spinning in a circle. Training your dog to do this trick requires using a bit of wet food to get him to perform the desired action. Then you will need to reward the action and pair it with the command \"spin.\" [9]\n\nFirst smear a bit of tasty dog food on the tip of his tail. When he reaches around to lick his tail, click to mark the correct action of turning to one side.\nContinue to reward him for reaching around to his tail and mark/reward the behavior. After a few times, begin to name the behavior as “spin.”\nAs you continue to train this behavior, your dog should start turning to continue to be rewarded. After a while, the turning will evolve into a full spin.",
                "Get your dog to do a high five. Training your dog to do a high five is simple. Wait for your dog to lift a paw, then click the clicker to mark the behavior. Then give him a reward. If your dog seldom lifts his paw, then you can gently lift his paw and click to show him that this is a good thing to do.[10]",
                "Train your dog to speak and be quiet. Knock on the door or do another similar action that might trigger your dog to bark. Then, click the clicker to mark the barking and reward him as well. After a few times of repeating the action, start saying \"speak\" along with the clicker, so that he knows what he's expected to do.[11]\n\nThe Speak command goes hand-in-hand with \"quiet.\" Once you have trained your dog to bark on command, you can also teach him to be silent. To do this ask him to speak, then click and reward him. While he is eating the treat and being silent, click to mark the quiet, and then give him another reward. Then, start to label the action as \"quiet.” By teaching “speak” and “quiet” together, you can control when your dog barks and when he is silent.",
                "Change up rewards now and then. Once your dog has learned a command, start to make the rewards a bit unpredictable to keep him motivated. You can do this by rewarding every fourth or fifth time that your dog performs the desired behavior rather than every time. Changing up your dog’s rewards will help to prevent your dog from taking his rewards for granted. It will also help to keep his focus on working to earn a reward.[12]",
                "Train often with short sessions. Remember to train often for short periods of time. Each dog has his own concentration span, so work within your dog’s abilities. Your dog may only have enough attention for five minutes of training or he may be able to train for 20 minutes. If your dog starts to lose concentration or starts to make mistakes, then end the session.[13]",
                "End on a high note. To help keep our dog motivated and happy, always try to end on a high note by asking your dog to do something simple at the end of your training session. For example, you can ask your dog to perform one of the tricks he has mastered, such as sit or speak. Make sure that you reward your dog with lots of praise and a treat to let him know he is doing a good job.[14]",
                "Train in a quiet environment free from distractions when starting out. It is helpful to start training your dog in quiet locations where he will not be distracted. Stick to a quiet, distraction-free place until your dog has mastered the trick. Once your dog gets the idea, you can begin to vary your location to reinforce the trick even more.[15]\n\nIt is important to use different locations so that your dog knows the commands apply wherever he is. For example, if you always ask your dog to “spin” in the kitchen, he may begin to associate spinning in a circle with standing in front of the fridge."

                "Make a list of what people or things matter to you. When looking for a life plan, it makes sense to prioritize some areas of your life. List all the things that you value in your life. You might list your family, friends, a certain hobby, nature, or career. Take the time to think deeply about the things without which you could not imagine living.\n\n\nFor example, while you might like playing basketball, is this one of the most important things in your life? Perhaps it is. If not, it is likely a hobby.",
                "Determine your core values. You have your own moral compass, which guides you through life. What are the values you want your life to reflect? Do you strive to be honest? Perhaps you want to be caring and considerate towards others. Maybe you have a strong sense of social justice. Defining your values will help you determine your future actions.\n\n\nFor example, if you prize honesty, there are some careers that might not be the best for you. CIA agents, for example, cannot disclose to others what they really do.\nOn the other hand, if you care passionately about social justice, perhaps you could consider studying social work.\nFor additional tips, see Live Life to the Fullest.",
                "Find your calling. Every person has his or her own talents and strengths. Aim to live your life in reflection of your unique calling. Finding your calling does not mean following someone else’s path.[1] Instead, seek to define what you do well and how you can live a life that incorporates your strength and perhaps helps other people as well.\n\n\nFor example, you might be a talented teacher and musician. Perhaps your calling is to teach children piano lessons.\nOn the other hand, you might be a great listener and care about helping others. You might be well-suited to be a psychologist.\nIf dinosaur bones excite you to no end, perhaps your calling is paleontology and spreading knowledge about dinosaurs and environmental change to a new generation.",
                "Name your goals. By making goals for life, we can live with a purpose. Do know that at any given time, your goals might change. You can adapt your goals as you move through life. If you have some structure, however, your life likely will be a bit easier.\n\n\nFor example, you might want to become a physician. Your mini goals could be attending college, gaining entrance to medical school, graduating, and beginning to practice medicine. Each of these goals will have sub-goals.\nIf your goal, on the other hand, is to have children, first you should think about how you want to have them. Do you want a partner with whom you can raise them? Do you prefer to adopt? What are the different strategies you can pursue to fulfill this goal?",
                "Prioritize. After you have ascertained the people who matter to you, your values, and your goals, create priorities. At different points in life, you might prioritize different aspects. For example, while in school, your studies might take precedence. Later, your relationship or children might take more of your focus. By keeping your priorities in mind, you can better schedule your life.\n\n\nSee Prioritize for additional tips.",
                "Build strong relationships with close ones. Take the time to build solid relationships with the people about whom you care. Listen to their problems. Help them when necessary. When you offend them, apologize and strive to do better. Practice kind gestures like giving people rides or birthday cards. See Have a Healthy Relationship for more advice. Additionally, practice these behaviors:\n\n\nBuild a circle of trust. Make sure your family members and friends know they can share their thoughts openly with you. Do not tell other people's secrets. If someone asks you to keep a confidence, do so.\nBe compassionate towards others. Even if someone wrongs you, if they are sincere in their repentance, show them forgiveness. Do not bring up their past transgressions in moments of anger.",
                "Promote healthy communication. Be direct when speaking to others. Listen carefully and attentively. If you have disagreements, try to fight effectively. That is, do not call each other names. Instead, discuss your problems calmly. Make sure you listen to the other person's point of view.\n\n\nFor example, it might be wise during arguments to repeat the other person's point of view. This shows you understand. You might say, \"What I'm hearing you say is that you are annoyed by the fact that I am always home so late.\"\nAsk rather than assume. If you feel a relationship is suffering in some way, talk to the other person openly and candidly.[2]",
                "Be a good neighbor. Part of living a good life comes from building a tight-knit local network. If you have neighbors, be helpful to them. Watch their cat when they go on vacation. Offer to shovel an elderly neighbor’s driveway. Practice neighborliness and you might find it is contagious.",
                "Serve your community. One way to live a good life is to contribute to the community in which you live. You might volunteer at a soup kitchen or run a clothes drive for refugees.

Listen carefully for the different animals’ and insects’ noises. Smell the plants or fresh rain. The world is filled with amazing attributes. Take a moment to let it sink in.\n\n\nConsider taking a reflective, multi-sensory walk in which you do not focus on any technology.

            "intro": "Preserving beetroot allows you to enjoy summer's bounty all year long. Beetroot is preserved in a light pickling solution that perfectly complements its earthy flavor as well as keeping it from spoiling. To preserve beetroot, simply wash and process the vegetables, mix up a pickling solution and store in sterilized jars.",
            "steps": [
                "Sterilize your canning jars. You may use mason jars with lids and rings or recycled glass jars that previously held tomato sauce or other food items. If you're using used jars, scrub out the jars with soapy water and a scrub brush to remove all food particles, or run them through the dishwasher. Sterilize the jars, lids, and any utensils you're using in the following way:[1]\n\nPlace them in a large pot and fill it with cold water.\nBring the water to a boil and boil for 10 minutes.\nRemove them with clean tongs and allow them to dry on a clean towel.",
                "Select beetroot at the peak of ripeness. Ideally, beetroot will have been harvested about one month prior to preserving it. This gives the vegetable time to cure and finish ripening, resulting in the best flavor. Look for beetroot that's firm with no visible bruises or soft spot.\n\n\nThough ripe beetroot is best, since preserved beetroot gains flavor from the pickling liquid, you can use beets that are on the older side or aren't quite ripe yet.",
                "Scrub the beetroot. Fresh beetroot is often caked with dirt. Take a vegetable brush and scrub it on all dies to remove the grit. Rinse thoroughly under cold running water. If you find blemishes under the dirt, slice them off with a paring knife.[2]",
                "Remove the greens. Slice off the greens with a sharp paring knife. Beetroot greens are tasty in their own right. Consider stewing them up after you're finished preserving your beetroot.",
                "Boil the beetroot. Place it in a large pot and cover with water. Sprinkle a teaspoon or so of salt into the water, then turn the heat up and bring it to a boil. Boil the beetroot until you can easily stick one with a knife, about 30 minutes. Then remove the pot from heat and drain the water.\n\nIf you have beetroot of varying sizes, place the larger vegetables in the water first. Let them boil for about five minutes before adding the remaining beets. This will ensure that the largest beets cook all the way through and the smaller ones don't overcook.",
                "Peel the beetroot. When the beetroot is cool enough to touch, simply slide off the peels with your fingers. After boiling, it the beetroot peels should easily slip off. Help them along with a knife if necessary. Discard the peels when you're finished.",
                "Slice the beetroot. Many choose to pickle beetroot in discs suitable for sandwiches, but you can cut the beetroot into any shape you'd like. Cutting the beetroot into smaller pieces allows you to pack more into the jars.",
                "Mix the pickling liquid. Do this while the beetroot is hot so that the liquid will also be hot when the beetroot is ready. Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for two minutes.",
                "Fill the jars with beetroot. Distribute it evenly among the jars you have set out. Pack in the beetroot to within a few inches of the tops of the jars.",
                "Top off with pickling liquid. Pour it over the beetroot to within half inch of the top of each jar. It's important to leave a bit of headspace at the top of the jar to prevent too much pressure from accumulating there. Place the lids on the jars and tighten them.\n\n\nIf you see air bubbles in the jars, tap the bottoms of the jars lightly against the counter top to make them float to the top and pop.",
                "Let the jars cool completely. Set them on the counter and let them cool overnight before storing.",
                "Allow the beetroot to pickle for at least a week before opening. During this time the pickling liquid will penetrate the beetroot to add flavor and change the texture. You may enjoy the beetroot at any time after one week has passed.\n\n\nBeetroot preserved this way will keep up to three months in a cool, dark place.\nOnce you open a jar, store it in the refrigerator."

        "wikiHow to Leave the Past Behind": {
            "intro": "What should you do if you encounter an old friend, boyfriend, or girlfriend who triggers bad behavior, such as drinking or taking drugs?",
            "steps": [
                "Acknowledge the challenges of the past. Unresolved past experiences can sometimes produce lasting psychological and physiological effects. In such cases, it’s important to come to terms with how your past is affecting your current outlook or habits.\n\n\nAn important first step is to stop trying to pretend you aren't affected by past events. You can't get over the past until you accept it. If something happens that reminds you of a traumatic event or triggers a strong emotional reaction, try to calmly acknowledge to yourself that this is the case. Let yourself feel what you feel about the past. Later steps in this article provide some specific strategies to help with this.\nFor example, if you find yourself in a social situation that triggers powerful emotions about the past, don't try to push them away. Instead, excuse yourself for a moment and step away from the group. Then, take a moment to reflect on the past and how it is affecting you before rejoining the group.\nThe impact of past traumas can be especially strong if you are without a strong social support network.[1]\n\nSometimes, the trauma resulting from past experiences can be so intense that it affects the people you care about.[2] Unresolved past experience can prevent you from building strong relationships with your loved ones. They can also keep you preoccupied with dreams that never came to fruition. This, in turn, can affect your current outlook and habits in ways that make it hard to cope with obstacles in your life.[3]",
                "Understand how trauma affects the brain. Traumatic or particularly intense experiences can affect our neurochemistry. At times, this can even impact the structure of our brains.\n\n\nIf you find yourself feeling like you should just \"get over it,\" remind yourself that reality is more complicated than that. Traumatic events can actually change the way your brain works. This can take a long time to overcome, so cut yourself some slack and try to be patient.\nEmerging research in neuroscience  suggests that brains have a certain “plasticity.” Our genetic predispositions can be manipulated and expressed in unpredictable ways after powerful experiences.[4] In other words, your brain can change. It is a product of both your genes and your experiences.\nThe physiological and psychological effects of past experiences can seem difficult to overcome and incorporate into your life. But, it’s important to keep in mind your body and brain are constantly reorganizing themselves based on new experiences.[5] Your brain and body have changed before, and will change again. You can make that change a positive thing.",
                "Accept that you cannot change what happened, only how you view it. You can't revisit the past, but you can change the way you perceive it and handle it from now on. If you don't, your hurt self will carry over this emotional pain into other new experiences and relationships.\n\n\nYour efforts here should be directed toward accepting the past and forgiving those who may have wronged you. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions you have about your past. Then, try to let those feelings go.[6]\n\nWhen you experience anger or sorrow about the past, try to remind yourself that hanging on to these negative emotions only harms you in the end. No amount of anger will undo what happened. Acknowledge your feelings. Then, look within for the compassion to forgive those who harmed you and the strength to let go.[7]\n\nThis process will take time and will be different for each person. Other steps in this article are designed to help with the process.\nDwelling on the past can cause problems without any conscious desire on your behalf.",
                "Try meditation or yoga. There are several activities called embodied physical practices that can help you make peace with the past. Meditation and yoga, for example, can help you develop personal coping techniques. These activities help you become more sensitive to the ways your emotions affect different parts of your body.[8]\n\nYoga is best learned with the guidance of a professional instructor. If you've never tried it before check online to see if there are free or low-cost introductory classes offered in your community. Many places have affordable options you can use to try yoga and see if it's right for you.\nMeditation is something you can easily do alone in your home. Find a comfortable place to sit with your legs crossed and your hands in your lap. Close your eyes and take slow deep breaths. If your mind wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing. Try a CD or a downloaded MP3 to help guide you through meditation.[9]\n\nThese practices give you the psychological time and space to identify particular emotions related to past experiences. In doing so, they can allow you to notice and work through the effects they’ve had on your behavior and thought processes.[10]",
                "Keep a journal. Write about the events in your day-to-day life, or about the past. These are great ways to work through difficult emotions.[11]\n\nStart off one night by simply listing the events you experienced throughout the day. You don't even need to force them into any sort of narrative. Try not to think too hard about it; keep your mind open and just write down whatever feels natural. This will get you comfortable with the process of journaling.\nThis should become easier with each day as it develops into a habit. At this point you can start writing about past experiences that come to mind during your writing sessions.\nFocus on your thoughts and feelings. The important thing is to express yourself, not to tell a beautiful story.[12]\n\nJournaling about the upsetting events of your past can help you come to terms with them and make them less intrusive in your day-to-day life. Expressive writing has both mental and physical health benefits. It can help you process your emotions and can also help restore disturbed sleep patterns.[13]\n\nThis kind of emotional work can take some time and introspection but it can be very productive if you let the process unfold on its own.",
                "Spend time with other people. Unresolved past experiences can sometimes make it feel impossible to trust new people in your life. This can make it hard to build healthy relationships. However, strong social support systems can be the most important factor in healing the effects of damaging experiences.[14]\n\nIt’s important to feel supported around other people as opposed to frightened so take it slow at first; maybe just meet a new person for coffee.\nVolunteering can also be a great way for you to become more comfortable with interacting with other people again. This can even help you become more comfortable with your vulnerabilities as you see others bear their own.",
                "Seek professional help. If you ever feel overwhelmed, or utterly helpless, consider getting support from a professional. If what you’re dealing with just won't go away or isn’t improved with the steps above speak to a counselor or therapist.[15]\n\nThere are times when past experiences can be so debilitating that it’s necessary to get help from someone who has helped people through such issues before. This is what counselors and therapists are for.\nIf you don’t know how to find one you could speak to your primary care doctor who will likely be able to refer you.\nYour insurance policy may cover a certain number of visits to a mental health professional. Check your policy details to find out.",
                "Evaluate your social circle. Consider leaving behind friends who keep you focused on the past. The social environment we live is an essential part of what defines both who we are.[16] It also affects how we incorporate unresolved past experiences into our lives.\n\n\nSpend some time thinking (or maybe writing in your journal) about the people you spend time with and how they make you feel. If there are people in your life who make you feel bad or reinforce negative habits, consider spending less time with them.\nFor example, people who constantly put you down may not be good to have in your life. Friends who make it difficult for you to do what you need to do to incorporate difficult past experiences can also be a problem. Consider making new friends, or at least initiating a change of scenery.\nThis of isn’t always easy, but can be a great way to force you out of your comfort zone and grow as a person.\nIt's a good idea to try new hobbies with your new companions. When you're ready, start to push the boundaries of your comfort zone by joining a local sports team or art class. New directions for your life will gradually emerge that might not have otherwise seemed possible.",
                "Be grateful for the friends who support you. Don't upset yourself by thinking about people who did not respect and appreciate you. Instead, concentrate on those who stick by your side. Let them know you appreciate their help.[17]\n\nIt can be hard not to dwell on negativity. But, your supportive friends are the ones who deserve your attention.\nKeep good friends close by during this time. Having a supportive community of people around you will help you stay strong. It will allow you to feel confident enough to engage with unresolved past experiences or difficult emotions without feeling alone.\nWhen you feel like you're slipping, try spending some time around someone you trust who can help keep you on the right track.[18]\n\nIf you feel that you are going to fall back into a bad habit, or are on the verge of despair, call a trusted friend and ask if he or she can meet you for coffee or swing by your house. Having someone around can help you feel supported. This can help you make through tough times.",
                "Try systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization is the process of gradually easing people into potentially distressing situations while using relaxation techniques.The goal is over time to feel more comfortable experimenting with these situations on your own.[19]\n\nThis is an approach you can use to start getting comfortable with situations that are causing you a great deal of anxiety.\nStart by learning basic relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Then, expose yourself to situations that remind you of those that make you feel uncomfortable. Use the relaxation techniques you've learned to stay calm.\nStart with short exposures to stressful situations. The key here is to move at your own pace, guarding against pushing yourself too far. Eventually, you should be able to engage comfortably in situations that currently cause you distress.\nFor example, imagine you were attacked and badly hurt by a vicious dog. You might start avoiding all dogs. To move beyond this, you could try visiting a trusted friend who has a dog you know to be friendly. Use relaxation techniques before and during a short visit to your friend's home. Try to visit often, staying a little longer each time. This might be difficult at first, but spending a little time with a non-threatening dog could help you overcome your feelings about the attack.",
                "Engage with your fears and alter your habits. Sometimes we develop habits that keep us from confronting and moving beyond unresolved experiences. They can keep us from incorporating their effects into our decisions in the present.[20] Part of incorporating these effects is breaking these habits to confront your feelings.\n\n\nLet's stick with the example of a fear of dogs. If you were attacked by a dog, you might develop a habit of crossing the street when you see someone walking a dog. You might get to the point where you do this without even thinking about it. In the short run, this might reduce your anxiety. But in the long run, it might be preventing you from getting over your fear. If nothing else, its an inconvenience. In this situation, you could make an effort to break this habit. You don't need to seek out dogs, but try to stop crossing the street when you see one coming. After getting comfortable with that, you might even ask that stranger if you could pet their dog. Gradually, this will help you let go of the traumatic event.\nSystematic desensitization can he helpful in trying to change counterproductive habits.\nSometimes we don't notice how unresolved experiences have changed us. Our attempts to avoid them become embedded in our day-to-day habits. One way to become more aware of changes in behavior is to ask someone you trust if they notice anything odd in the way you’ve been acting. Other people often are able to pick up on things we aren’t able to notice in ourselves.[21]\n\nFor example, after a breakup you could ask your best friend: “have I been acting weird in any way since me and my girlfriend broke up?”",
                "Make a list to track your behavior. Sit down make a list of all the times you avoided doing something because you were afraid or didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. You don’t even have to know why you were afraid at the time. Sometimes just writing about your feelings about past experiences can be a great way to allow them to flow more openly.\n\n\nThis can be especially valuable if you don't have a good friend around to ask about your behavior.\nAs the ideas start to flow, think about new ways you can approach these situations in the future.\nFor example, imagine your list makes it clear that you’re hesitant to go out with your friends. Start by inviting them over to your house so you have a little bit more control over the situation. Maybe invite those you are closest to over at first, and then after a few visits, ask them to bring over some people you don’t know very well.\nTake it slow and don’t be afraid to ask for help from people you trust. A gradual progression can help you incorporate the effects of most negative past experiences that you haven’t been able to resolve.\nBy slowly pushing yourself in ways that might have made you uncomfortable before, dysfunctional habits will begin to fade away. Then you can start working towards building new, more functional habits in your day-to-day life.",
                "Put troubling objects away. For a time, it can be helpful to put the things that remind you of the unresolved past experience in a box. Get a large box and throw into it anything that reminds you of a past failed relationship, a job that left you feeling sore. Anything physical that reminds you of troubling experiences should go in the box.\n\n\nAfter some time has passed, decide whether this box should be tossed or stored. Either way, you are coming to a conclusion about its contents that they can no longer influence you.",
                "Write down your feelings or say them out loud. Putting words and names to emotions and unresolved experiences can make them more tangible. This can help you better manage your feelings.\n\n\nYou could, for instance, write a letter to a person or people in the past who hurt you or experienced a difficult event with you. Being able to engage with such people from your past can be quite helpful, even if they are not actually present for you to converse with.[22]\n\nYou could write or speak poetry or prose. Anything that allows you to let out the feelings you are holding on to from the past is fine. No matter how horrid the words are that come to mind, let them out.",
                "Make thoughtful decisions. While you're going through the healing process, try to be aware of the triggers that can send you back to past habits. This can include experiences like coming in contact a person who hurt you. Sometimes even watching a movie that reminds you of an unresolved experience can be a trigger.\n\n\nWhen you are exposed to such a situation, use the techniques described above. Actively aim to put a hold on habitual reactions and challenge yourself to do things differently.\nThis also means avoiding making decisions in haste that you may regret later. For example, think carefully before cutting off ties with somebody in your family or sending someone notes filled with anger. Before quitting something you have been doing for a long time, such as a job, give this careful consideration. Some of these choices might end up being the path you take after thinking it through. Initially though, this exercise is about strengthening yourself to make calm and enlightened decisions.\nIt can be especially helpful to check in with a therapist or mental health counselor. He or she will often have suggestions to help you cope with experiences that trigger negative feelings.\nRemember in difficult times that you do care about tomorrow. Your goal is to build a responsible, thoughtful, and clear future that is free of the control of past habits.",
                "Take it slowly but surely. Don't expect an overnight transformation. You will only achieve the best results by allowing yourself time and space to incorporate the effects of the past into your life.\n\n\nEach person recovers a different pace. If you start to think: \"I should be over this by now,\" try to replace that thought with: \"I have made progress and will continue to do so.\""

        "wikiHow to Do Viking Braids": {
            "intro": "If you’re a fan of braided hairstyles, try the Viking braid! This trendy style, popularized by the television show Vikings, consists of two braids on each side of the head and a French braid in the middle. We’ve found that the easiest way to get sleek Viking braids is to texturize and section your hair before you begin braiding. Then, all you have to do is braid the side sections, followed by the top section, to complete the look. Now, you and your trendy Viking braids are ready for adventure!",
            "steps": [
                "Skip the shower. Viking braids are not perfectly neat or sleek, and it’s easiest to create this look in second (or third or fourth) day hair. The oils in your hair will give it a bit of natural hold and texture. Remember, this look is supposed to look a bit messy and rugged![1]",
                "Spray with texturizing spray or dry shampoo. If you have very fine, smooth hair (or if you showered recently), you’ll want to add a bit of texture. There are a few ways you can do this. You can buy a texturizing spray at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store, and this will add a bit of grit to your locks. A dry shampoo can do exactly the same thing. Spritz it all over your hair, and then run your fingers through it.[2]",
                "Section the top of your hair. You’ll be creating multiple braids for this look, so sectioning out your hair is key. You can use claw clips, duckbill clips, or any sort of hair clip that you have handy. First, gather the hair on the very top of your head. Put your fingers on either side of your forehead and trace your fingers back, scooping up all of the hair on the top of your head going back. Clip this very top section up and out of the way with your hair clip of choice.",
                "Create sections on the sides of your head. Once the top section is clipped up, you need to section out the hair on both sides of your head. You will be creating two braids on each side of your head, for a total of four. First, gather up all of your hair on one side of your head, starting at your hairline. Then, create a part extending back from your hairline, splitting the side section of hair into a top and bottom section. Clip up the top section so you can work with the bottom section of hair first.\n\nDo exactly the same thing on the other side of your head.\nWhen you are finished, you will have five total sections along the top of your head: the top section and two sections on either side.",
                "Begin with the bottom section of hair on either side. After you’ve clipped up the very top section of hair, you should’ve split the sections on either side of your head down the center horizontally. You’ll be starting with the bottom sections of hair on either side of your head, closest to your ears.[3]",
                "Begin creating a rope braid. Split the section of hair into two pieces for the rope braid. Start twisting them toward your head tightly, picking up more hair in the section as you work. You want the finished effect to be tight against your head, like a cornrow, so make sure you are holding the hair taut as you work.[4]",
                "Finish the section with a traditional three-strand braid. Once you’ve created a tight rope braid against your head and are behind your ear, switch from the rope braid to a three-strand braid. Don’t worry if it isn’t a perfectly smooth transition, because these braids are supposed to look imperfect.[5]\n\nBraid to the end of your hair, and then secure it with a clear elastic.\n\nTease the tail of your braid so that the elastic is concealed and the end of the braid has a lot of volume and texture.",
                "Repeat this process on all of the side sections. Once you’ve created your first braid, do it again on the other side. Then, do exactly the same process with the pinned up side sections. Note that the very top of your hair is still clipped up – this is just to finish the cornrow side braids. You will finish with two braids on either side.[6]",
                "Slide your braids up. This step is optional. If you want to leave your two side braids as is, you certainly can. For some added interest, you can turn these into “snake” braids. To do this, untie the braid and firmly grasp the middle strand. Combine the two outer strands and push them upwards along the braid. This will cause the plaits to slide up and bunch at the top, creating a really intricate effect.[7]\n\nPushing your braid up like this might create frizz, but that fits perfectly with the look of a Viking.\nTie your hair off at the bottom of the snake braid.",
                "French braid your hair to the back. Once you’ve completed and tied off your side cornrows, it’s time to work with the very top section. Unclip it and smooth out any huge tangles with your fingers. Then, French braid it to the back. It’s okay if you aren’t an expert at French braiding – the messier, the better.[8]\n\nIf you have shorter hair, you can end the top braid in a small bun. In fact, the Vikings character Ragnar Lothbrok often rocks a version of the \"man bun\" at the end of his braid.[9]",
                "End your braid wherever you like. You can braid until the ends of your hair, or you can do it about halfway down the strands. The important thing is that the very top of your head is braided, and the length of your braid is up to you. Tie it off with a clear hair elastic.[10]",
                "Tease the end of the braid. The finishing touch for this braid is the backcombing, just like with the rest of your braids. After you’ve tied off the end, use a teasing comb to backcomb whatever hair is left. You can also carefully loosen or mess up your braid to give it a more tousled, authentically Viking look.",
                "Spray your Viking braids with hairspray. Once you've finished braiding, teasing, and securing your braids, spritz the entire hairstyle with hairspray. This will help hold all of your handiwork in place and make sure your braids last throughout the day. The beauty of this style, however, is that flyaways and loose pieces are welcome. This style is meant to look a bit messy, so don't worry about making sure everything is perfectly placed.\n\nIf you are worried about your braids lasting throughout the day, bring a comb and some extra hair ties along with you. You can always re-braid sections of your hair as needed!"

        "wikiHow to Treat Ovarian Cysts": {
            "intro": "A cyst is a sac-like structure filled with semisolid material, gases, or liquid. During the monthly cycle, the ovaries normally grow cyst-like follicles which release an egg upon ovulation. Sometimes, these cysts do not get resorbed and can become a problem. The most common ovarian cysts are functional, usually painless, and commonly disappear without any medical intervention within two to three menstrual cycles. Other types of uncommon ovarian cysts can occur. You should always speak to a physician before trying at home treatments for ovarian cysts.[1] If you have spoken to your doctor, there are a few things you can do to help treat your cysts.",
            "steps": [
                "Wait patiently. Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cyst. Most often, the first course of action is to wait. Functional cysts often disappear on their own within a few cycles. The cysts may be monitored by ultrasounds every one to three cycles to determine if the cysts are getting smaller or not.[2]",
                "Use over-the-counter pain relievers. Pain relievers can help alleviate the pain connected to ovarian cysts. Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, NSAIDs, like Aleve or Advil, and aspirin, like Bayer, can help.[3]",
                "Take oral contraceptives. Your physician may prescribe oral contraceptives to control and prevent some forms of ovarian cysts. Oral contraceptives are useful in both preventing and sometimes treating ovarian cysts. If you are using the oral contraceptives for birth control, you will probably be put on a regular dose. If the oral contraceptives are being used only to treat the cysts, the dose will be the lowest possible for the shortest period of time.[4]\n\nTaking birth control pills decreases the risk of some types of ovarian cysts, but carry their own risks. These include an increased risk of cancer of the breast, cervix, and liver, heart disease, and stroke.[5]",
                "Consider surgery. Surgery to treat ovarian cysts is very rare. However, if your cyst looks large, is recurrent, or there are multiple cysts, your doctor may suggest that they be surgically removed. Your doctor may also consider removing the cyst if it causes a lot of pain or other problems. This treatment option needs to be discussed with your doctor.[6]",
                "Use a heat pad. Heat can be used to relax muscles and relieve any cramping that you may be experience. You can use either a heating pad or a hot water bottle. Place either on your lower abdomen for about 15 minutes. You can repeat this 3-4 times a day.[7]",
                "Try castor oil. Castor oil has anti-inflammatory properties and has been used as a traditional treatment for any kind of menstrual pain. It may improve the blood flow during the menstrual period.[8]\n\nStart by applying enough castor oil on your lower abdomen to completely coat the area.\nTake a large, clean, cotton towel and cover your lower abdomen. Then, use either a heating pad or a hot water bottle and place it over the towel.\nLeave the heat and towel on for at least 30 minutes. Repeat four to five times a week.",
                "Take a warm bath. A warm bath may help to relax the muscles in your abdomen. Soaking in hot water may also relieve cramping.[9]",
                "Drink herbal tea. Drinking herbal teas can help relieve the pain of ovarian cysts. Try teas such as chamomile, mint, raspberry, and blackberry. These teas may help reduce tension in your muscles and calm your mood.[10]",
                "Change your diet. Diets full of meat and cheese may cause more ovarian cysts. Instead, eat more fruits and vegetables as part of your regular diet. This may help reduce ovarian cysts.[11]\n\nA healthy diet also helps prevent obesity, which can lead to more ovarian cysts.",
                "Consider rebalancing your hormones using natural progesterone. Progesterone can inhibit ovulation, thus decreasing the likelihood of ovarian cysts. This approach should only be used when working with your physician. Even though creams are available online, you need to be working with someone to ensure there are no complications.[12]\n\nBeginning 10 days after the beginning of your last menstrual period (Day 10 of the cycle), use a natural progesterone cream. Apply on your inner thigh or behind your knees. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.",
                "Rebalance your hormones using herbs. The following herbs can be used to rebalance the natural hormone levels. When using any of these products,follow manufacturer’s instructions.\n\n\nMaca is a root vegetable from Peru that has traditionally been used to treat fertility and energy issues. Maca may be beneficial in balancing hormonal levels. It is commonly used for these purposes in treating menopause.[13]\n\nChaste berry is traditionally used to balance reproductive herbs and may help decrease the pain, discomfort, and the size of ovarian cysts. It is being studied for its effects in PMS to reduce pain.[14]",
                "Monitor pelvic pain. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of ovarian cysts. This pain is a dull ache that may radiate to your lower back and thighs. The pain can occur just before your period begins or just before it ends.[15]\n\nThe pain can occur only during intercourse.\nThe pain can also occur during bowel movements or if there is any pressure on your bowels.",
                "Look for other symptoms of ovarian cysts. Most ovarian cysts are painless and symptomless, and often disappear on their own. These cysts can result in symptoms, however. The symptoms include:[16]\n\nNausea, vomiting, or breast tenderness similar to that experienced during pregnancy\nA feeling of abdominal fullness or heaviness\nA feeling of pressure on your bladder. This can cause more frequent urination or difficulty emptying the bladder completely",
                "Be aware of the risk factors. There are a number of possible risk factors for cysts, and these can play a role in any treatment choices. These include:[17][18]\n\nA history of previous cysts\nIrregular menstrual cycles\nBeginning menstruation younger than 12\nInfertility or a history of infertility treatments\nLow thyroid function\nTreatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer\nSmoking and use of tobacco products\nChronic inflammatory conditions",
                "Schedule a doctor’s appointment. You should see your doctor regularly if you have had a history of ovarian cysts. If any of the symptoms listed become severe or interfere with your daily life, call your physician. If you have severe abdominal or lower abdominal or pelvic pain, especially when accompanied by fever or nausea or vomiting, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n\nLet your physician know what home treatments you are pursuing and let your physician know if they are helping."

        "wikiHow to Clean Brushed Stainless Steel": {
            "intro": "Cleaning brushed stainless steel isn't that different from cleaning regular stainless steel. You can use water for basic spills, and then try a few other household cleaners or homemade cleaners for tougher stains. Whatever you do, be sure to read the manual that came with the item if possible, as it may have specific instructions for cleaning that particular item.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Start with water. For basic spills, just plain water will do the trick. Use a soft rag, and apply warm water to the surface. You can use this method to wipe up spills, as well as small stains. Wipe with clear water once the stain is up.[2]",
                "Wipe in the direction of the grain. If you look closely at the surface of brushed stainless steel, you'll notice it has a grain. It's important to wipe with the grain, rather than against it. If you wipe against the grain, you can end up damaging the surface.[3]",
                "Avoid abrasiveness. Anything that's too abrasive can scratch the surface of brushed stainless steel. That includes abrasive sponges and steel wool, but it also includes very hard water or gritty (dirty) water.[4]",
                "Wait until the appliance is cool. If you're cleaning an appliance like an oven or a toaster, it's a good idea to wait until it's cool before cleaning. Lightly touch the appliance. If it feels cool, it's fine to clean it.[5]",
                "Try stainless-steel specific products. Many products on the market are designed specifically for stainless steel. Because they are designed for stainless steel, they are more likely to keep your appliances looking sparkling.[6]\n\nYou could try CLR for stainless steel, for instance.",
                "Use a glass cleaner. In some cases, a glass cleaner with ammonia may work on spills. Make sure to check for bleach before using them, as you don't want to apply bleach to stainless steel.[7]",
                "Skip products with chloride. Products with chloride in them can be harmful to the surface of stainless steel, particularly brushed stainless steel. Therefore, you should avoid cleaners with bleach when working on these surfaces.[8]",
                "Avoid oven cleaners. If the area is extra greasy or on the oven, you might be tempted to use an oven cleaner. However, oven cleaners are too abrasive for brushed stainless steel, so avoid applying them to this surface.[9]",
                "Use dish soap and water. One way to keep your brushed stainless steel sparkling is to wipe it down often with a little soap and water. In fact, if you wipe it down when you're cooking or doing dishes, it will help you maintain the surface. Wipe off any soap when you're done, though, as you should only leave water on the surface.[10]",
                "Try vinegar. Vinegar is a good natural solution for brushed stainless steel. Use a spray bottle to apply white vinegar to the surface. Follow up with a soft cloth, such as microfiber, always wiping in the direction of the grain.[11]",
                "Apply baking soda. Baking soda can remove tough stains, such as coffee. Use a soft wet rag to scrub with the baking soda, then wipe the baking soda away with a clean rag. Follow the grain.[12]\n\nYou can also mix baking soda with dishwashing soap to make a paste and use that to scrub the surface.[13]",
                "Rinse the surface after using a cleaner. No matter what product you use, make sure you rinse it off when you're done. You don't want any product to sit on the surface of the stainless steel, as it could damage the surface over time.[14]",

        "How to Sleep with Scoliosis": {
            "intro": "Scoliosis is a condition that causes the spine to curve in an unnatural way. If you have scoliosis, you will need to be extra careful about the way you sleep, as choosing a bad position can make your scoliosis symptoms worse. There are also a few things you can do to help yourself sleep better if you have scoliosis.",
            "steps": [
                "Sleep on your back. The best sleeping position for people with scoliosis is flat on the back. This is a neutral position that does not cause any unnecessary strain or create any unnatural curves in the spine.[1]\n\nThis position is especially preferred for people who have a lateral spinal curvature.",
                "Avoid sleeping on your stomach. Sleeping on your stomach is very bad for your back if you have scoliosis. This is because the position forces the middle and lower sections of your spine to be straight, and your neck to twist.[2]",
                "Try not to sleep on your side. While not as bad as sleeping on your stomach, sleeping on your side is also not ideal for scoliosis patients. This position may cause unnecessary pressure on your pelvis, neck and shoulders.[3]",
                "Train yourself to sleep in a new position. If you're not used to sleeping on your back, it may feel unnatural. If you find yourself instinctively changing to a different sleeping position during the night, you may need to use some tricks to break that habit.[4]\n\nOne option is to create a barricade around yourself with extra pillows so that you can't roll over.\nAnother option is to tape uncooked peas (or any similar item) to your sides. This will make it uncomfortable to sleep on your side, so you will roll back onto your back.",
                "Invest in a good mattress. It's extra important to have a comfortable, supportive mattress if you have scoliosis. For most individuals, a medium to firm mattress is the best choice, although it's most important that you are comfortable.[5]\n\nMemory foam may not be the right choice for people with scoliosis, as it does not always provide as much support as a traditional mattress.[6]",
                "Use supportive pillows. Many people who have scoliosis do not have the proper amount of curvature in their necks and low backs. Try sleeping on a cervical pillow and a lumbar roll to help encourage your spine to curve in a healthy way.[7]\n\nA single pillow or roll is preferable to multiple pillows. Sleeping on a stack of pillows can be harmful.",
                "Follow your doctor's instructions about wearing your brace. If you have a brace to correct the curvature in your spine, it's important that you wear it as much as your doctor tells you to. Most patients are supposed to wear their braces 21 hours or more each day, which means they must keep them on at night.[8]",
                "Stay active. Staying active during the day may help alleviate any back pain you have. It will also help you burn energy, which will make it easier to fall asleep at night.\n\n\nAerobic exercise, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises are all great for people with scoliosis.[9]\n\nAvoid contact sports, as well as competitive swimming, which can strain your back.",
                "Keep it dark. People with scoliosis may produce lower levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps us sleep.[10] Nighttime light, whether it's from a lamp, the television, or any other source, disrupts melatonin production for everyone, and this is especially bad for individuals who produce less of it to start with. Keep your room nice and dark to avoid disrupting your body's melatonin production.[11]\n\nChildren with scoliosis tend to have higher levels of growth hormone. When there are high levels of growth hormone in the body, melatonin levels will usually be low.[12]",
                "Be patient while adjusting to your brace. If you have just been given a brace to wear for your scoliosis, you may feel like sleeping comfortably in it will be impossible. Luckily, most people get used to their braces quickly, so it probably won't bother you at all after a week or two.[13]\n\nIf you continue to have discomfort while sleeping after the first few weeks, talk to your doctor and see if any adjustments can be made to the brace.",
                "Manage your pain. While some people do not experience any pain from scoliosis, others suffer from severe pain. If pain is keeping you awake at night, talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. There are a variety of ways to treat scoliosis pain, depending on the severity of your condition.[14]\n\nFor mild pain, you can take over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. If your pain is more severe, your doctor may suggest that you take prescription pain medication.\nYour doctor may also recommend spinal injections to help relieve pain, although these will only provide you with temporary relief.\nPhysical therapy or chiropractic treatment may help you achieve long-term pain relief.\nIf nothing else works to control your pain, your doctor may recommend surgery. The most common types of surgery performed for scoliosis are decompression surgery, which is done to remove a disc or bone that is compressing a nerve, and spinal fusion surgery, which is done to fuse two or more of the vertebrae together, thus improving the shape of the spine."

        "How to Improve Your Writing Skills": {
            "intro": "Perhaps you have dreams of becoming the next Great Novelist. Or maybe you just want to be able to better express your thoughts and ideas more clearly. Whether you want to improve your writing skills as a creative writer or simply perfect your skills for schoolwork, you can take some steps to learn how to be a better writer. Becoming a great writer—or even a good writer—takes practice and knowledge, but with enough hard work perhaps someday somebody will aspire to be the next you!",
            "steps": [
                "Use active instead of passive voice. One of the most common manifestations of bad writing is overuse of the passive voice. In English, the most basic sentence structure is S-V-O: Subject-Verb-Object. “The zombie bit the man” is an example of this sentence structure. The passive voice can cause confusion by putting the object first: “The man was bitten by the zombie.” It usually requires more words and use of a “to be” verb form, which can suck the energy out of your writing. Learn to avoid these constructions as much as you can.[1]\n\nUsing the passive voice isn't always bad. Sometimes there is no clear way to make a statement active, or sometimes you want the lighter touch a passive construction allows. But learn to follow this rule before you start making exceptions.\nThe main exception to this is science writing, which conventionally uses the passive voice to put the emphasis on the results, rather than the researchers (although this is changing, so check the guidelines before you write). For example, “puppies fed spicy dog food were found to have more upset stomachs” puts the emphasis on the finding rather than the person doing the finding.[2]",
                "Use strong words. Good writing, whether it’s in a novel or a scholarly essay, is precise, evocative and spiced with the unexpected. Finding the right verb or adjective can turn an uninspired sentence into one people will remember and quote for years to come. Look for words that are as specific as possible. Try not to repeat the same word over and over unless you are trying to build a rhythm with it.\n\n\nOne exception to this is the words used to describe dialogue. Bad writing is filled with \"he commented\" and \"she opined.\" A well-placed \"sputtered\" can work wonders, but most of the time a simple \"said\" will do. It may feel awkward to use the word \"said\" over and over, but changing it up unnecessarily makes it harder for your readers to get into the back-and-forth flow of the conversation. “He said/she said” becomes nearly invisible to your readers after a while, allowing them to stay focused on the characters’ voices.[3]\n\nStrong doesn't mean obscure, or more complicated. Don't say \"utilize\" when you could say \"use.\" \"He sprinted\" is not necessarily better than \"he ran.\" If you have a really good opportunity to use \"ameliorate,\" go for it—unless \"ease\" is just as good there.\nThesauruses can be handy, but use them with caution. Consider the predicament Joey from Friends gets into when he uses a thesaurus without also consulting a dictionary: “They’re warm, nice people with big hearts” becomes “They’re humid, prepossessing homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.”[4] If you’re going to use a thesaurus to spice up your vocabulary, look up your new words in the dictionary to determine their precise meaning.",
                "Cut the chaff. Good writing is simple, clear and direct. You don't get points for saying in 50 words what could be said in 20, or for using multi-syllable words when a short one does just as well. Good writing is about using the right words, not filling up the page. It might feel good at first to pack a lot of ideas and details into a single sentence, but chances are that sentence is just going to be hard to read. If a phrase doesn't add anything valuable, just cut it.[5]\n\nAdverbs are the classic crutch of mediocre writing, and they often serve only to clutter up a sentence. A well-placed adverb can be delightful, but much of the time the adverbs we use are already implied by the verb or adjective—or would be if we had chosen a more evocative word. Don't write \"screamed fearfully\" -- \"scream\" already suggests fear. If you notice that your writing is filled with \"-ly\" words, it might be time to take a deep breath and give your writing more focus.[6]\n\nSometimes cutting the chaff is best done at the editing stage. You don't have to obsess about finding the most concise way to phrase every sentence; get your ideas down on paper however you can and then go through to edit out unnecessary stuff.\nYour writing doesn't just exist in a vacuum—it's experienced in conjunction with the reader's imagination. You don't need to describe every detail if a few good ones can spur the reader's mind to fill in the rest. Lay down well-placed dots and let the reader connect them.",
                "Show, don't tell. Don’t tell your readers anything that could be shown instead. Instead of just sitting your readers down for a long exposition explaining a character's background or a plot-point's significance, try to let the readers discover the same ideas through the words, feelings and actions of your characters. Especially in fiction, putting this classic piece of writing advice into practice is one of the most powerful lessons a writer can learn.[7]\n\nFor example, “Sydney was angry after reading the letter” tells the reader that Sydney felt angry, but doesn’t give us any way to see it for ourselves. It’s lazy and unconvincing. “Sydney crumpled the letter and threw it into the fireplace before she stormed from the room” shows that Sydney was angry without having to say it outright. This is far more effective. Readers believe what we see, not what we’re told.",
                "Avoid clichés. Clichés are phrases, ideas or situations that have been used so often that they’ve lost any impact they once had.[8] They’re also usually too general to leave a lasting impression on your reader. Whether you’re writing fiction or nonfiction, cutting clichés out of your work will make it better.[9]\n\n\"It was a dark and stormy night\" is a classic example of a clichéd phrase—even now a clichéd concept. Compare these similar weather-related opening lines:[10]\n“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”—1984, by George Orwell. It's not dark, nor stormy, nor night. But you can tell right from the start something's not quite right in 1984.\n“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”—Neuromancer, by William Gibson, in the same book that gave us the word \"cyberspace.\" This not only gives you the weather report, it does so in such a way that you are immediately placed into his dystopian world.\n\"“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.”—A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens. Weather, emotion, damnation, and despair—Dickens covered it all with an opening line that leaves the reader ready for anything.\n\n\nClichés are also important to avoid when you’re writing about yourself. Saying you’re a “people person” says nothing definite about you. Saying you’re able to communicate well with a variety of people because you grew up in a bilingual family and lived in six countries growing up lets your reader know you’re a “people person” without you relying on lazy language.",
                "Avoid generalizations. One of the hallmarks of sloppy writing is broad generalizations. For example, an academic essay might say something like “In modern times, we are more progressive than people a hundred years ago.” This statement makes a host of unfounded assumptions and doesn’t define important ideas like “progressive.” Be precise and specific. Whether you’re writing a short story or a scholarly essay, steering clear of generalizations and universal statements will improve your writing.\n\n\nThis applies to creative writing, too. Don’t allow yourself to assume anything without examining it. For example, if you’re writing a story about a female character, don’t assume that she would automatically be more emotional than a man or more inclined to be gentle or kindly. This kind of non-examined thinking keeps you in a creative rut and prevents you from exploring the variety of possibilities that real life presents.",
                "Back up what you say. Don’t speculate without providing evidence for your assertions. In creative writing terms, this is similar to the “show, don’t tell” principle. Don’t just say that without a strong police force society as we know it would break down. Why is that true? What evidence do you have? Explaining the thinking behind your statements will allow readers to see that you know what you’re talking about. It will also help them determine whether they agree with you.",
                "Use metaphors and similes with caution. While a good metaphor or simile can give your writing punch and vigor, a bad one can make your writing as weak as a baby. (That, by the way, was a weak simile.) Overusing metaphors and similes can also suggest that you aren’t confident with what you’re saying and are relying on figures of speech to explain your ideas. They can also become clichéd really quickly.\n\n\nA “mixed” metaphor mixes two metaphors so that they don’t make sense. For example, “We’ll burn that bridge when we come to it” mixes the common metaphor “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it” and “Don’t burn bridges.” If you’re not sure how a metaphor goes, look it up -- or skip it altogether.",
                "Break the rules. The best writers don't just follow the rules—they know when and how to break them. Everything from traditional grammar to the writing advice above is up for grabs if you know a transgression will improve your piece. The key is that you have to write well enough the rest of the time that it's clear you are breaking the rule knowingly and on purpose.\n\n\nAs with everything, moderation is key. Using one rhetorical question to create a punchy opening can be very effective. Using a string of six rhetorical questions would quickly diminish their effect. Be choosy about when and why you break the rules.",
                "Edit, edit, edit. Editing is one of the most essential parts of writing. Once you finish a piece of writing, let it sit for a day and then read it over with fresh eyes, catching confusing bits or scrapping whole paragraphs—anything to make your piece better. Then when you are done, give it another read, and another.\n\n\nSome people confuse “editing” with “proofreading.” Both are important, but editing focuses on considering what your content is and how it works. Don’t become so attached to your wording or a particular idea that you aren’t willing to change it if you discover that your ideas would be more clear or effective presented in another way. Proofreading is more technical and catches errors of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting.",
                "Pick up a good book or ten. Whether you’re writing the next Great American Novel or a scientific journal article, becoming familiar with examples of excellent writing in your genre will help you improve your own writing. Read and understand the works of great and influential writers to learn what is possible with the written word and what readers respond to best. By immersing yourself in works by good writers, you will expand your vocabulary, build knowledge, and feed your imagination.[11][12]\n\nLook for different ways of organizing a piece of writing or presenting a narrative.\nTry comparing different author's approaches to the same subject to see how they are alike and how they differ. For example, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilych, and Hemingway's The Snows of Kilimanjaro.\nRemember that even if you’re writing nonfiction or academic writing, reading examples of great writing will improve your own. The more familiar you are with the many ways it’s possible to communicate ideas, the more varied and original your own writing can become.",
                "Map the allusions that run through your culture. You might not realize it, but books, movies and other media are filled with references and homages to great literature. By reading some classics, you will build a body of cultural knowledge that will better inform your own writing.",
                "Make sure you understand why a classic work is considered great. It's possible to read a novel like The Catcher in the Rye and not \"get it\" or see its value immediately. If this happens, try reading an essay or two about the piece to learn why it was so influential and effective. You may discover layers of meaning that you missed. Understanding what makes great writing great is one of the best ways to grow your own skills.\n\n\nThis applies for nonfiction and academic writing too. Take some examples of work by well-respected authors in your field and take them apart. What do they have in common? How do they work? What are they doing that you could do yourself?",
                "Attend the theatre. Plays were written to be performed. If you find that you just don’t “get” a work of literature, find a performance of it. If you can’t find a performance, read the work aloud. Get yourself into the heads of its characters. Listen to how the language sounds as you read it.\n\n\nMore than a movie ever can be, a theatrical performance is like words come to life, with only the director's interpretation and the actor's delivery as filters between the author's pen and your ears.",
                "Read magazines, newspapers, and everything else. Literature isn't the only place to get ideas—the real world is filled with fascinating people, places and events that will inspire your writerly mind. A great writer is in touch with the important issues of the day.",
                "Know when to put down your influences. It happens all the time: you finish an awesome novel, and it leaves you fired up to get cracking on your own writing. But when you sit down at your desk, your words come out sounding unoriginal, like an imitation of the author you were just reading. For all you can learn from great writers, you need to be able to develop your own voice. Learn to cleanse your palate of influences with a free writing exercise, a review of your past works, or even just a meditative jog.",
                "Buy a notebook. Not just any notebook, but a good sturdy one you can take with you anywhere. Ideas happen anywhere, and you want to be able to capture those oft-fleeting ideas before they escape you like that dream you had the other night about...um...it was...uh...well it was really good at the time!",
                "Write down any ideas that come to you. Titles, subtitles, topics, characters, situations, phrases, metaphors—write down anything that will spark your imagination later when you're ready.\n\n\nIf you don’t feel creatively inspired, practice taking notes about situations. Write down the way people work at a coffee shop. Note how the sunlight strikes your desk in the late afternoon. Paying attention to concrete details will help you be a better writer, whether you’re writing poetry or a newspaper article.",
                "Fill up your notebook and keep going. When you finish a notebook, put a label on it with the date range and any general notes, so you can refer back to it when you need a creative kick in the pants.",
                "Join a writing workshop. One of the best ways to improve your writing and stay motivated is to talk with others and get feedback on your work. Find a local or online writing group. In these groups members usually read each other's writing and discuss what they liked, didn't like and how a piece might be improved. You may find that offering feedback, as well as receiving it, helps you learn valuable lessons to build your skills.\n\n\nWorkshops aren’t just for creative writers! Academic writing can also be improved by having friends or colleagues look at it. Working with others also encourages you to share your ideas with others and listen to theirs.",
                "Write every day. Keep a diary, mail a pen pal, or just set aside an hour or so for free writing. Just pick a topic and start writing. The topic itself doesn't matter—the idea is to write. And write. And write some more. Writing is a skill that takes practice, and it’s a muscle that you can strengthen and nourish with the right training.[13]",
                "Pick a topic and lay out a general arc for your story. It doesn't have to be complex, just a way to get your head around the direction of the plot. For example, that classic Hollywood story line: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. (The chase scenes are added later.)",
                "Write an outline. It can be tempting to just start writing and try to figure out twists and turns of your plot as you go along. Don't do it! Even a simple outline will help you see the big picture and save you hours of rewriting. Start with a basic arc and expand section by section. Flesh out your story, populating it with at least the main characters, locations, time period, and mood.\n\n\nWhen you have part of an outline that will take more than a few words to describe, create a sub-outline to break that section into manageable parts.",
                "Keep some space in your story outline to add characters, and what makes them who they are. Give each of them a little story of their own, and even if you don't add that info into your story, it will give a sense of how your character might act in a given situation.",
                "Don't be afraid to hop around. If you suddenly have a brilliant idea about how to resolve a situation near the end, but you're still on Chapter 1, write it down! Never let an idea go to waste.",
                "Write the first draft. You're now ready to start your \"sloppy copy,\" otherwise known as your first draft! Using your outline, flesh out the characters and the narrative.\n\n\nDon’t let yourself get bogged down here. It’s not crucial to find exactly the perfect word when you’re drafting. It’s much more important to get all your ideas out so you can tinker with them.",
                "Let your story guide you. Let your story have its say, and you may find yourself heading in unexpected, but very interesting directions. You're still the director, but stay open to inspiration.\n\n\nYou’ll find that if you’ve thought sufficiently about who your characters are, what they want, and why they want it, they’ll guide how you write.",
                "Finish your first draft. Don't get caught up in fine tuning things yet, just let the story play out on paper. If you realize 2/3 of the way through the story that a character is really the Ambassador to India, make a note, and finish the story with her as the Ambassador. Don't go back and start re-writing her part till you're done with the first draft.",
                "Write it again. First draft, remember? Now you get to write it from the beginning, this time knowing all the details of your story that will make your characters much more real and believable. Now you know why he's on that airplane, and why she is dressed like a punk.",
                "Write it through to the end. By the time you are done with the second draft, you will have all the information about your story, your characters, the main plot, and the subplots defined.",
                "Read and share your story. Now that you've finished the second draft, it's time to read it—dispassionately, if possible, so that you can at least try to be objective. Share it with a couple trusted friends whose opinions you respect.",
                "Write the final draft. Armed with notes from your reading the story, plus notes of your friends or publishers, go through your story one more time, finalizing as you go. Tie up loose ends, resolve conflicts, eliminate any characters that do not add to the story."

            "intro": "Shrimp have a delicate seafood flavor that pairs well with various spices and sauces. They cook quickly, making them an excellent choice for weeknight dinners or other meals you have to make in a hurry. Shrimp are delicious boiled, sautéd on the stove, or grilled in the backyard.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose fresh or frozen shrimp. Most markets carry both fresh and frozen shrimp.\n\n\nIf you choose fresh shrimp, the flesh should be translucent white and the shell should be light grey. Be sure the shrimp is not leaking liquid.\nFrozen shrimp comes either precooked or uncooked. These cooking methods are for uncooked shrimp.",
                "Choose shrimp with or without shells. Fresh shrimp are often sold pre-peeled. If you buy shrimp with shells, you will have to peel them yourself.\n\n\nShrimp can be peeled either before or after cooking. Many find it easier to peel cooked shrimp. Cooking with the shells on also helps preserve the flavor.\nTo peel shrimp, grasp the legs and tear them off. Open the shell along the inner curve of the body and remove it.\nShrimp shells can be used to make shrimp stock.",
                "Devein the shrimp. Devein the shrimp after they have been peeled. It's easier to devein shrimp before they are cooked.\n\n\nUse a sharp paring knife to cut a slit along the outer curve of the shrimp's body. The cut will reveal a dark brown or black vein, the shrimp's digestive tract. Use your fingers, a fork or the paring knife to lift it out of the shrimp and discard it.\nThe vein is not unhealthy to eat, but many people prefer not to.",
                "Prepare the shrimp. Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before you plan to cook them.\nRinse them with cool water and allow them to sit at room temperature.\n\n\nShrimp can be boiled with their peels on or after they have been peeled.",
                "Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the shrimp completely.",
                "Bring the water to a full, rolling boil on high heat.",
                "Add the shrimp to the pot. Make sure they are completely submerged.",
                "Allow the shrimp to cook for 1 to 2 minutes. As the water begins to heat again, watch for small bubbles to break the surface of the water. This will occur after about 1 to 2 minutes, depending on how much water is in the pot. When you see the bubbles, remove the pot from the heat.",
                "Cover the pot and steep the shrimp. Allow them to continue cooking in the hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the shrimp. They will turn pink when they are finished cooking.",
                "Drain the shrimp. Pour the shrimp into a strainer or colander to drain them. Serve warm.\n\n\nIf you didn't peel your shrimp before cooking them, you can either serve them with the peel on and allow people to peel their own shrimp, or peel the shrimp yourself when they're finished cooking and serve them that way.",
                "Prepare the shrimp. Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and rinse them under cool water. Shake the excess water from the shrimp.\n\n\nPeel the shrimp if you would like to cook them without the shells.\nLeave the shells on if you prefer to peel them after they are cooked.",
                "Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and swirl it around the pan.",
                "Place the shrimp in the skillet. Arrange them in a single layer, making sure they don't overlap.",
                "Cook the shrimp for 2-3 minutes. The side touching the pan will begin to turn pink.",
                "Flip the shrimp and cook the other side. Make sure each shrimp gets flipped. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the second side is pink. The shrimp are finished when they have turned bright pink and the flesh is opaque white, rather than translucent.",

                "Thread the shrimp onto skewers. Pierce the skewers through both the tail and the thickest part of the shrimp toward the head.\n\n\nMetal or wooden skewers are both fine to use. If you use wooden skewers, soak them in water for 10 minutes before threading the shrimp onto them. This will prevent the skewers from burning.\nConsider threading the skewers with onion slices, green and red pepper slices, and other vegetables with the shrimp.",
                "Brush the shrimp with oil. Lightly cover the shrimp with olive oil on both sides. Season it with salt and pepper to taste.",

        "wikiHow to Grow Dahlias in Pots": {
            "intro": "Dahlias are bright, beautiful flowers that come in a wide variety of colors. Due to their height, however, many gardeners may feel skeptical about planting them in pots. Dahlias can thrive in pots as long as the container is large enough, but varieties that are three feet in height or taller may need additional support from stakes.",
            "steps": [
                "Select a variety of dahlia suited for container growing. Dwarf and low-growing varieties work best, but nearly any type can be grown if you have a large enough pot.",
                "Pick out a large pot. A good container to start with should be approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep by 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. Larger varieties may need even larger containers, however, especially if the flowers exceed 3 feet (0.91 m) in height.",
                "Choose a heavy pot. A light pot may not be sturdy enough, and the dahlia could become top heavy as a result.",
                "Drill additional drainage holes. This step may not be necessary if the container you use already has several large drainage holes that allow excess moisture to drain quickly. If your pot has small holes or only has one center hole, you may need to drill a few extra holes to improve drainage.",
                "Clean the pot. A dirty pot could spread disease, and hidden insect eggs may be lying in wait at the bottom of the pot. Remove these threats by cleaning the container before you plant. Simple soap and water will usually do the trick.",
                "Pick out a coarse potting mix. Standard potting soil alone is too porous and may lead to pour bud formation. A good potting mix includes both potting soil and garden soil, or potting soil and compost. Alternatively, non-soil mixes made of fine bark, peat, and various minerals may also work.",
                "Plant the tubers before the roots start to grow too long. Long roots will become entangled, and separating the roots will damage them. If the tubers need to spend time forming new roots, the flower's upward growth and bloom will be delayed and may be minimized for the season.",
                "Start sometime in April or May.\n\n\nIf starting the dahlias in pots that sit outdoors, wait until mid-April through all of May.\nIf starting the flowers indoors, you can plant the tubers in early April.",
                "Place one or two biodegradable coffee filters over the holes in the bottom of your pot. Filters wick away moisture, preventing the roots from drowning. Placing gravel at the bottom of your pot will accomplish the same task, but a dahlia's roots need all the space they can get to grow, and the coffee filter method takes up much less room than gravel would. Placing filters over the holes may also prevent bugs from getting in.",
                "Fill your container a third way full with your potting mix. Do not pack it tightly; allow the soil to remain loose.\n\n\nIf using a pot deeper than 12 inches, you may need to fill it with more soil. When all is said and done, dahlias need to be planted about 6 inches deep, and there should be an inch between the surface of the soil and the rim of the pot at the end of the potting process.",
                "Moisten the soil. Make it damp, but do not soak.",
                "Mix a handful of bone meal and fertilizer into the soil. Dahlias require a lot of nutrients to thrive. Fish or seaweed fertilizer can provide additional micro nutrients, as well.\n\n\nYou can also purchase a copolymer slurry from a gardening store instead of using bone meal and fertilizer. Follow the package for usage directions.\nIf mixing the slurry, fertilizer, or bone meal into the soil causes the coffee filters to move from the bottom of the pot, remove the soil from the pot and mix the elements together that way. Simply add it back in, over the repositioned filters, once everything is combined.",
                "Plant the tuber in the soil. Lay it down horizontally and leave at least 1/4 inch space between the root end of the tuber and the side of the pot. If an eye has already developed, center the eye in the middle of the pot and allow it to face upward. The sprout will come through from this eye.",
                "Cover the dahlia tuber with pre-moistened soil. Do not bury the tuber at this time, however. Instead, cover it with a minimal amount of soil so that you may monitor its growth.",
                "Allow any exposed eyes to remain above the soil. Lightly spritz the exposed surface of the tuber with just enough warm water to moisten the surface.",
                "Add more soil as the stalk grows. Do so carefully to avoid damaging the stalk, since the stalk is still fairly fragile at this stage. Never cover the top set of leaves. Continue adding soil until only an inch of empty space remains between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.",
                "Insert a stake into the pot, and tie the stalk to the stake. Large dahlia varieties need extra support to prevent the stalks from breaking off. Use a four foot stake with most varieties. Metal works best due to its sturdiness. The base of the stake should touch the bottom of the pot, and the stake itself should be firmly held in place by the soil and/or wires tied to holes drilled into the sides of the pot.",
                "Water the tubers deeply once the stalk extends above the rim of the pot. Give them a thorough watering two or three times a week. Dahlias growing in hot, dry climates may need daily watering. Never allow the soil to get soggy, however.",
                "Place the pot in full sun. Dahlias grow best with six to eight hours of direct sunlight.",
                "Supplement sunlight with fluorescent plant lights if started indoors. Many indoor dahlias do not receive enough light from the sun, and a plant light may be necessary to spur proper growth. Set the light about six inches above the top rim of the pot for newly planted tubers and raise the light as the plants grow.",
                "Fertilize the flowers once every two weeks from June through September. Use a low nitrogen fertilizer, and avoiding over-feeding.",
                "Remove bottom leaves late in the season, usually around mid-July. The removal of these leaves improves air circulation, which reduces the risk of mildew.",
                "Spray your dahlia with fungicide or insecticide as needed. Dahlias are subject to attacks from mold, earwigs, slugs, spider mites, aphids, and cucumber beetles."

        "How to Write a Paragraph": {
            "intro": "The practice of writing paragraphs is essential to good writing. Paragraphs help to break up large chunks of text and makes the content easier for readers to digest. They guide the reader through your argument by focusing on one main idea or goal.[1] However, knowing how to write a good, well-structured paragraph can be little tricky. Read the guidelines below and learn how to take your paragraph writing skills from good to great!",
            "steps": [
                "Decide what the main topic of the paragraph is going to be. Before you begin writing your paragraph, you must have a clear idea of what the paragraph is going to be about. This is because a paragraph is essentially a collection of sentences that all relate to one central topic.[2] Without a definite idea of what the main topic is, your paragraph will lack focus and unity. In order to pin down the exact topic of your paragraph, you should ask yourself a number of questions:\n\n\n\nWhat is the prompt I have been given? If you are writing a paragraph as a response or answer to a particular prompt, such as \"You have decided to donate money to charity. Which charity do you choose and why?\" or \"Describe your favorite day of the week,\" you will need to think carefully about that prompt and make sure you are directly addressing it, rather than going off topic.\n\nWhat are the main ideas or issues that I need to address? Think about the topic you are being asked or have decided to write about and consider what the most relevant ideas or issues relating to that topic are. As paragraphs are usually relatively short, it is important that you try to hit on all of the main ideas, without going off topic.\n\nWho am I writing for? Think about who the intended readership of this paragraph or paper is going to be. What is their prior knowledge? Are they familiar with the topic at hand, or will it require a number of explanatory sentences?\nIf your paragraphs are part of a larger essay, writing an essay outline can help you define the major ideas or goals of each paragraph.",
                "Write down information and ideas relating to that topic. Once you have a clearer idea of what you want to address in your paragraph, you can start organizing your thoughts by writing down your ideas on a notepad or word document. There's no need to write out full sentences just yet, just jot down some key words and phrases. Once you see everything on paper, you may get a clearer idea of which points are essential to include in your paragraph, and which points are superfluous.\n\n\nAt this point, you may realize that there's a gap in your knowledge and that it will be necessary to look up some facts and figures to support your argument.\nIt's a good idea to do this research now, so you will have all the relevant information easily at hand when it comes to the writing stage.",
                "Figure out how you want to structure your paragraph. Now that all of your thoughts, ideas, facts and figures are laid out clearly in front of you, you can start to think about how you want to structure your paragraph. Consider each of the points you wish to address and try to arrange them in a logical order - this will make your paragraph more coherent and easier to read.[3]\n\nThis new order may be chronological, may put the most important information first, or may just make the paragraph easier and more interesting to read - it all depends on the topic and style of the paragraph you wish to write.[3]\n\nOnce you have decided where you want everything to go, you can rewrite your points according to this new structure - this will help to make the writing process a lot faster and more straightforward.",
                "Write a topic sentence. The first sentence of your paragraph needs to be the topic sentence. A topic sentence is an introductory line that addresses what the main idea or thesis of the paragraph is going to be. It should contain the most important and relevant point you wish to make regarding your topic, thus summarizing the paragraph as a whole.[2]\nDon't: use an obvious fact as your topic sentence.Do: feel free to start with a vague idea if you feel stuck, and improve it once you've finished the paragraph.\n\n\nEvery other sentence you write should support the topic sentence and provide further detail and discussion of the issues or ideas it raises. If any sentence you write cannot be directly related to the topic sentence, it should not be included in this particular paragraph.\nMore experienced writers can include their topic sentence at any point in the paragraph; it doesn't necessarily need to be the first line. However, writers who are new or less comfortable with paragraph writing should stick with having the topic sentence first, as it will help to guide you throughout the rest of the paragraph.[2]\n\nYour topic sentence should not be too broad or too narrow. If your topic sentence is too broad you will not be able to discuss its ideas adequately in your paragraph. If it’s too narrow, you won’t have enough to discuss.[4]",
                "Fill in the supporting details. Once you have written and are happy with your topic sentence, you can start to fill in the rest of your paragraph. This is where the detailed, well-structured notes you wrote earlier will come in handy. Make sure that your paragraph is coherent, which means that it is easy to read and understand, that each sentence connects with the next and that everything flows nicely as a whole. To achieve this, try to write clear, simple sentences that express exactly what you want to say.[3]\n\nLink each sentence with transition words which form a bridge between one sentence and the next. Transition words can help you compare and contrast, show sequence, show cause and effect, highlight important ideas, and progress smoothly from one idea to the next. Such transition words include \"furthermore\", \"in fact\" and \"in addition to\". You can also use chronological transitions, such as \"firstly\", \"secondly\" and \"thirdly\".[3]\n\nThe supporting sentences are the meat of your paragraph, so you should fill them with as much evidence to support your topic sentence as possible. Depending on the topic, you can use facts, figures, statistics and examples or you can use stories, anecdotes and quotes. Anything goes, as long as it is relevant.[2]\n\nIn terms of length, three to five sentences will usually be enough to cover your main points and adequately support your topic sentence, but this will vary greatly depending on the topic and the length of the paper you are writing. There is no set length for a paragraph. It should be as long as it needs to be to adequately cover the main idea.[3][5]",
                "Write a concluding sentence. The concluding sentence of your paragraph should tie everything together. A good concluding sentence will reinforce the idea outlined in your topic sentence, but now it has all the weight of the evidence or arguments contained in your supporting sentences behind it. After reading the concluding sentence, the reader should have no doubt as to the accuracy or relevance of the paragraph as a whole.\n\nDon't disagree with your own evidence: Despite these comments, the report was a failure.Do qualify the conclusion if it transitions to the next paragraph: These quotes prove the report had major support, but this does not mean it led to major change.\n\n\n\nDon’t just reword the topic sentence. Your concluding sentence should acknowledge the discussion that has come before it and remind your reader of the relevance of this discussion.[6]\n\nFor example, in a paragraph dealing with the topic \"Why is Canada a great place to live?\" The concluding sentence might look something like \"From all the evidence provided above, such as Canada's fantastic health care provisions, its top-notch education system and its clean, safe cities, we can conclude that Canada is indeed a great place to live.\"",
                "Know when to move on to a new paragraph. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell where one paragraph should end and another begin. Luckily, there are a number of guidelines you can follow which can make the decision to move on to a new paragraph an obvious one. The most basic guideline to follow is that every time you start to discuss a new idea, you should move on to a new paragraph. Paragraphs should never contain more than one central idea. If a given idea has multiple points or facets, then each individual aspect of the idea should be given its own paragraph.[2][7]\n\nA new paragraph is also used each time you are contrasting two points or presenting each side of an argument. For example, if your topic is \"should civil servants receive lower salaries?\" one paragraph would deal with the arguments supporting lower pay for civil servants, while the other paragraph would provide arguments against it.[2]\n\nParagraphs make a piece of writing easier to comprehend and give readers a \"break\" between new ideas in order to digest what they have just read. If you feel that the paragraph you are writing is becoming too complex, or contains a series of complex points, you may want to think about splitting it up into individual paragraphs.[2]\n\nWhen writing a paper, the introduction and conclusion should always be given their own paragraphs. The introductory paragraph should define the aim of the paper and what it hopes to achieve, while also giving a brief outline of the ideas and issues it will go on to discuss. The concluding paragraph provides a summary of the information and arguments contained in the paper and states in clear terms what the paper has shown and/or proven. It may also introduce a new idea, one that opens the reader's mind to the questions raised by the paper.[2]\n\nIf you’re writing fiction, you need to start a new paragraph in dialogue to show a new speaker.[8]",
                "Check your paragraph for spelling and grammar. Once you have finished writing, it is essential that you re-read your paragraph two or three times to check it for misspelled words and poor grammar. Spelling mistakes and bad grammar can significantly impact the perceived quality of your paragraph, even if the ideas and arguments it contains are of a high quality. It is very easy to overlook small mistakes when writing, so don't skip this step, even if you're in a rush.\n\n\nEnsure that each sentence has a subject and that all proper nouns are capitalized. Also make sure that all of the subjects and verbs agree with each other and that you use the same tense across the entire paragraph.\nUse a dictionary to double-check the spelling of words that you are unsure about, don't just assume that they are correct.\nCheck your paragraph for the proper use of punctuation, making sure that you use marks such as commas, colons, semicolons and ellipses in the correct context.",
                "Check your paragraph for coherency and style. Not only should the technical aspects of your writing be spot on, but you should also try to achieve clarity in your writing, as well as stylistic flow. You can do this by varying the length and format of your sentences and by using transitional words and a varied vocabulary.[2]\nDon't: use long words or \"thesaurus finds\" for their own sake.Do: use well-known synonyms to vary your writing rather than repeat the same word many times.\n\n\nThe point of view of your writing should remain consistent throughout the paragraph, and indeed, the entire paper. For example, if you are writing in the first person (e.g., \"I believe that...\") you should not switch to a passive voice (\"it is believed that\") halfway through.\nHowever, you should also try to avoid beginning every sentence with \"I think...\" or \"I contend that...\" Try to vary the format of your sentences, as this will make the paragraph more interesting for the reader and help it to flow more naturally.\nFor beginner writers, it is better to stick to short, to-the-point sentences which clearly express your point. Long, rambling sentences can very quickly become incoherent or fall victim to grammatical errors, so try to avoid them until you gain more experience as a writer.",
                "Decide if your paragraph is complete. Once you have re-read the paragraph and fixed any grammatical or stylistic errors, you should have one more glance over it to determine whether it is complete. Try to look at the paragraph objectively and decide whether it sufficiently supports and develops your topic sentence, or whether it needs a few more details or additional evidence to back up your claims.[3]\nDon't: get bogged down in minor edits before you've finished your essay.Do: make sure your point is crystal clear before you move on.\n\n\nIf you feel that the main claim of your topic sentence is sufficiently supported and well-developed by the contents of the rest of your paragraph, then your paragraph is probably complete. However, if any important aspect of the topic remains unexplored or unexplained or if the paragraph is shorter than three sentences, it probably needs a little more work.[3]\n\nOn the other hand, you may decide that your paragraph is too long and contains superfluous or tangential content. If this is the case, you should edit the paragraph so it contains only the most relevant information.\nIf you feel that all of the content is necessary to your point, but the paragraph is still too long, you should think about breaking it up into several smaller, more specific paragraphs."

        "wikiHow to Make Your Own Natural Skin Cream": {
            "intro": "Many skin care and cosmetic products currently on the market contain harmful chemicals that can damage your skin. Using homemade, natural skin care can help improve your overall complexion and give your skin a healthy glow. Along with natural remedies, it is also important to avoid factors that can cause damage to your skin. There are many ways you can make your own skin cream to help stay away from these harsh chemicals.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine your skin type. Different skin types require different care. A dermatologist can tell you your skin type and discuss any other skin conditions you might have. Such knowledge can help you avoid foods, medications, supplements, and skin care products that could make your skin worse. In general, the types of skin are:\n\n\nNormal skin, which has little or no sensitivity, extremely small pores and a bright complexion. It is not too dry or oily.\nCombination skin, which can be dry or normal in some areas and oily in others. The oily areas usually include the nose, forehead, and chin. It can cause overly dilated pores, blackheads, and an oily sheen on certain parts of the skin.\nOily skin, which has enlarged pores and is prone to blackheads, pimples, and other blemishes. People with oily skin can have either a dull or shiny complexion.\nDry skin, which is characterized by less elasticity, red patches, more visible wrinkles and lines, nearly invisible pores, and a dull sheen. Certain factors such as hormonal changes, dry weather, extended hot showers, medications, ultraviolet radiation, and ingredients in skin products can make dry skin worse. This causes scaly, irritated, inflamed, or peeling skin.[1]",
                "Choose the best ingredients for your skin type. If you plan on using your own homemade cream, it is important to know what kind of ingredients will work for your skin type and what could make it worse. In general, it is important to wash your skin at least twice a day to keep it clean. This will help avoid issues caused by bacteria, fungi, and free radicals.\n\n\nPeople with dry skin should use cream with moisturizing agents such as aloe, cocoa butter, olive oil, or honey. These also help repair cracked skin and reduce scars. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body that heals damaged skin while locking in moisture, which can be found in some commercial skin care products. Some studies suggest that hyaluronic acid can also prevent the appearance of aging and reduce the appearance of scars and blemishes.\nIf you have oily skin, opt for low-comedogenic oils, which are oils that clog your pores less. Salicylic acid is a natural cleanser derived from willow bark that neutralizes bacteria and soaks up excess oil on the skin’s surface, which helps prevent acne breakouts. Essential oils with citric acid, such as lemon oil, help control oily skin while promoting skin repair. Tea tree oil is also helpful for oily skin.\nRefreshing ingredients such as cucumber, aloe vera, or rose water alleviate inflammation and discomfort frequently experienced by people with sensitive or combination skin because of their cooling effect. Lactic acid, found in milk or yogurt, helps fight free radicals and harmful bacteria, remove dead skin cells, and gently moisturizes the skin.[2][3]",
                "Make a cream for dry skin. To make a skin cream for oily skin, put 1/4 cup almond oil, 2 tbsp coconut oil, 2 tbsp beeswax, 1/2 teaspoon vitamin E oil, and 1 tbsp shea butter in a glass jar. In a sauce pan, bring 3 to 4 inches of water to a simmer. Place the jar in the simmering water until the ingredients in the jar have melted completely. Then, combine the ingredients well in the jar. Move the cream into a smaller jar where you are going to keep the cream.\n\n\nLeave the cream at room temperature until the cream cools and hardens. Once it cools enough, place the lid on the jar.\nKeep the cream in a cool, dry place. The mixture can last for up to three months.\nThese ingredients are good for psoriasis, eczema, and scarring on the skin. They also have anti-aging qualities as well.[4]",
                "Mix a cream for combination skin. Heat 2 tbsp of almond oil, 2 tbsp jojoba oil, and 1 tbsp beeswax in a double boiler until all the oils are melted and combined, which is about two to five minutes. Pour the mixture in a large mixing bowl and let it cool to room temperature, which is about an hour or two. While this cools, mix 1/3 cup aloe vera gel and five to seven drops of an essential oil of your choice.\n\n\nOnce the mixture cools, take a hand mixture and start mixing the oils. Gradually add the aloe vera and essential oil combination while mixing. Keep adding until you get a thick consistency, about 10 minutes. You may not need to use all the aloe vera. Stop once you get the thickness you like. Move the cream to a jar.[5]",
                "Make a skin cream for oily skin. Heat 5 tbsp jojoba oil, 2 tbsp hemp seed oil, and 1 1/2 tsp beeswax in a double boiler until melted and combined. Next, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature, when it should start to solidify. Then, using a hand mixer, whip the oils and add 1 tsp aloe vera gel and a few drops of lemon essential oil or tea tree oil. Keep whipping until it gets thick enough. Then move it to small jar.\n\n\nThe jojoba oil and hemp seed oil have low comedogenic ratings, which means they are great for oily skin and won't clog your pores. The aloe vera help sooth the skin without adding oil and the lemon or tea tree oil will help remove excess oils from your skin.[6]",
                "Try a hydrating moisturizer. In a small bowl, mix ½ an egg white with 1 teaspoon of honey and almond oil. Egg white helps with firming the skin and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Almond oil gently moisturizes your skin, and honey helps seal in the moisture. Honey has also been known to reduce the appearance of blemishes and scars.\n\n\nApply a new mixture to your face in the morning and evening after cleansing every day. Wash with lukewarm water and pat dry.[7]",
                "Use carrot. Carrots have high levels of Vitamin A, C, and B6. These are natural vitamins to help your skin stay healthy and retain its natural glow. To make your own carrot moisturizer, boil 1 chopped carrot in a saucepan for five to seven minutes, then strain. Mash the carrot in a small bowl and allow it to cool.\n\n\nAdd 1 ½ tablespoon of yogurt to the mashed carrot for a cooling effect and mix until it is a smoother consistency. Store the cream in a cool, dry place in an air-tight jar. Apply twice daily after cleansing.\nTo further improve your skin’s complexion, eat carrots and drink carrot juice regularly to provide your body with essential nutrients.[8]",
                "Try milk. Cleanse your face with plain, full-fat milk. The lactic acid in milk is a mild exfoliant to help remove dead cells. It also helps even out the tone of your skin and reduces scars and blemishes. You can also use almond milk, which is high in Vitamin E, a substance that moisturizes the skin and is recommended for people with dry skin.\n\n\nTo use this, dip a cotton ball in a tablespoon of milk and massage it into your skin in a circular motion for at least three to five minutes. This effectively removes dirt from pores.\nIf you have inflamed pimples or oily skin, mix the milk with a teaspoon of rice or gram (garbanzo) flour. Gently massage it into your skin with your fingers. Rinse off the substance with cold water and then dry.[9][10]",
                "Make an avocado mask. Avocado has many ingredients that help stimulate the production of collagen in your face. Vitamins A and C, which are found in avocados, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These help protect the skin from harmful free radicals. Vitamin E, also found in avocados, helps reduce scars and moisturizes the skin.\n\n\nFor a natural avocado mask, peel an avocado and mash the pulp in a bowl. Apply the creamy substance to your face for 10 to 15 minutes, rinse it with cool water, then pat it dry. Apply it every day if you have dry or sensitive skin. Apply it twice a week if you have oily skin.\nTo help with anti-aging, mix ½ an avocado, teaspoon of lemon juice, ½ teaspoon of plain yogurt, and 1 teaspoon of coconut oil in a small bowl. Blend until the mixture is a creamy consistency that looks smooth. This is best achieved with ripe avocados.\nApply a small amount of this cream to your face. Keep the remainder of the cream in a cool, dry place in an air-tight container. Make sure you make this cream fresh every week, since the ingredients can go bad. Use this if you have dry and sensitive skin.[11][12]",
                "Use a sea-silt mask. Sea silt is a type of mud that contains sea salt. This substance is found in coastal regions and includes sulfur, unsaturated fatty acids, and algae. These ingredients give the sea-silt soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Sea-silt also helps smooth your skin's texture by removing dead skin cells as well as bacteria. It also improves the appearance of blemishes and scars.\n\n\nSea silt can be found in numerous store bought face masks, which are generally natural. The masks generally suggest application twice a week, but also check with your dermatologist for how much you should use it based on your skin type.\nIf you have dry, sensitive skin or combination skin, the sulfur and salt in the mask may cause irritation. It may also make inflamed scars worse.[13]",
                "Avoid stress. When you want to improve your skin, try to avoid stress. The hormones produced when you're stressed can cause your skin to become more sensitive to outside irritants. It also increase the production of sebum, an oil made by your skin. This oil can cause acne as well as other skin issues. Stress can also slow down healing, trigger irritations such as hives and fever blisters, and interrupt your daily routine. Avoid stress by:\n\n\nGetting regular exercise, because it can boost your mood and keep you physically active and fit. Take a moderate intensity walk for 10 minutes a day or a leisurely walk for 20 to 30 minutes at least five times a week to lift your mood.\nGet a minimum of seven to eight hours of sleep each night, since a lack of sleep can make you age faster and leave tired looking skin.\nPractice stress management techniques such as yoga, deep-breathing exercises, or meditation.[14][15]",
                "Have green tea. Green tea is filled with polyphenols, which are antioxidants that repair skin cells and stimulate the production of collagen in your skin. This helps give your skin a healthier glow and protect your skin from harmful free radicals and ultraviolet radiation. These properties also help reduce wrinkles and also has the benefit of decreasing stress.\n\n\nBrew green tea with warm water, which is 175 to 185°F or 80 to 85°C. Add two to three grams of loose leaf tea to the warm water for three to five minutes, then strain. You can drink this mixture two to three times each day.\nYou may be able to find topical treatments that contain green tea, which can benefit your complexion by improving blemishes and other issues[16]\n\nYou can also use premade green tea bags instead of loose leaf.",
                "Eat a healthy diet. Eating well can improve your skin from the inside out. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit and whole grains to improve your complexion. Eat foods especially high in vitamin A, C, and E as well as zinc to reduce the severity of acne and dermatitis. Some good sources of these vitamins include:\n\n\nSweet red peppers\nKale\nSpinach\nAmaranth Leaves\nTurnip Greens\nSweet Potato (Yams)\nPumpkin\nButternut Squash\nMangoes\nGrapefruit\nCantaloupe[17]",
                "Protect your skin radiation. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause blemishes, sun spots, wrinkles, and other skin problems as well as increase your likelihood of skin cancer. Ways to avoid exposure to UV radiation include:\n\n\nSeeking shade as much as possible and wearing protective clothing. This includes long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses, which help avoid getting wrinkles around your eyes.\nUsing a broad-spectrum sunscreen. People with dark skin should wear at least SPF 15, while people with lighter skin should use at least SPF 30.[18]",
                "Touch your face as little as possible. If you have combination or oily skin, avoid touching your face as much as possible. Dirt and bacteria from your hands clog your pores, which cause blemishes. If you suffer from acne often, remove excess dirt with a gentle, oil-free facial wipe.\n\n\nNever pop or squeeze pimples. This can cause scars and spread the bad bacteria further.[19]",
                "Use skin care without paraben. Parabens are preservatives that disrupts your skin's hormonal balance and puts you at a higher risk of female centered cancers. If you have acne or eczema, these may cause skin irritation and inflammation because they are a potential allergen.\n\n\nButyl and propyl paraben are considered more toxic than methylparaben and ethylparaben. However, methylparaben and ethylparaben are more easily absorbed by the human body. They also cause the skin to be more sensitive to UV radiation, which lead to skin problems.[20][21]"

        "How to Get Clear Skin": {
            "intro": "A spotty, blemish-ridden complexion is a constant source of woe for many people. The problem starts in your teenage years and, while it may get better, it often needs continued attention into adulthood. Keep reading for advice about different tactics you should use in your pursuit of clear skin.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash your face daily. For best results, wash your skin once in the morning after you wake up and once at night before you go to bed.[1]\n\nYou should also consider washing your face after you hit the gym, go for a run, or take part in any activity that produces extra sweat.\nStick with a facial cleanser instead of using regular soap. Facial cleansers have gentle formulas, but standard soap is usually too coarse and may irritate the sensitive skin of your face.",
                "Resist the urge to pop your pimples. Scratching at acne and popping your pimples will cause inflammation and scarring. The added irritation can even cause more acne.",
                "Spot-treat your pimples as needed. You can use a cleanser with a special spot-treating formula to reduce the lifespan of a pimple by a day or two.\n\n\nApply the product early and often until the offending zit vanishes.",
                "Moisturize your skin. After washing your face, apply a gentle moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out. Choose a cream, gel, or serum that will rub into your skin completely to avoid clogging your pores.\n\n\nIf you do not moisturize your skin, you run the risk of causing dry, dead skin cells to clog your pores.",
                "Apply fresh cosmetics with clean brushes.[2] Bacteria can fester inside your makeup and inside the tools you use to apply it. This bacteria gets transferred to your skin, causing more acne to develop.\n\n\nThrow out any makeup over a year old, even if it still looks clean when viewed with the naked eye.\nWash loose powder brushes every two to three weeks. Wash foundation brushes once a week.\nThrow away sponges that are too thickly coated in makeup to clean.",
                "Remove your makeup before going to bed. Even clean cosmetics trap toxins, forcing your skin to come into contact with them. Remove your makeup before you go to sleep in order to reduce the amount of time your skin must be exposed to these toxins.",
                "Make your skin feel minty fresh.[3] The menthol in mint is known to have a cooling effect, but it also proves itself to be an effective cleansing agent suitable for skincare use.\n\n\nApply mint juice over your face every night to clear up any acne.\nClear body acne by crushing mint leaves into a paste and adding the juice of one lemon. Mix it with warm water until it becomes a thick liquid and apply it over your body. Rinse with warm water once dry.",
                "Use papaya. Papaya contains papain, an enzyme with antibacterial properties that also removes dead skin cells.\n\n\nReduce sun spots and freckles by regularly applying a papaya-based mask consisting of 1/4 cup (60 ml) cocoa powder, 2 tsp (10 ml) heavy cream, 1/4 cup (60 ml) ripe papaya, 1/4 cup (60 ml) honey, and 2 tsp (10 ml) oatmeal powder. Blend together to form a paste before applying it to your face. Rinse after 10 minutes.",
                "Apply turmeric. This herb lightens skin blemishes and has antiseptic properties.\n\n\nMix enough turmeric powder and pineapple juice to form a paste. Apply this paste to the dark bags under your eyes.\nMix 2 to 3 tsp (10 to 15 ml) sugarcane juice with a sprinkle of turmeric powder and apply to your face to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.",
                "Try crushed walnut. Applying walnut powder is a gentle way to exfoliate your skin and remove impurities lurking deep inside your pores.\n\n\nMix 2 tsp (10 ml) crushed walnuts or walnut powder with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) plain yogurt. Gently scrub the mixture onto your face and rinse off after 20 minutes.",
                "Make a rice flour pack. Rice flour is thought to reduce the appearance of wrinkles while clearing your complexion.\n\n\nMix 1/4 cup (60 ml) rice flour with 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey. Apply to your face and rinse after 20 minutes.",
                "Try neem powder. Neem has antiviral and antibacterial properties that makes it well-suited for the purpose of clearing clogged pores and pimples.\n\n\nMix 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) neem powder with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) plain yogurt. Apply to your skin and rinse off with cool water. Do this up to twice a week.",
                "Cut up a cucumber. Cucumbers are effective at hydrating the skin while acting as an astringent. Using cucumbers regularly can prevent pimples, wrinkles, and dry skin.\n\n\nMix equal parts cucumber and milk and use the combination instead of a commercial cleanser.\nRub cucumber juice onto blemishes.\nPlace cucumber slices of packs of grated cucumbers onto your eyes to rid yourself of dark bags.\nRinse well with cool water after 20 minutes.",
                "Try a face wash with salicylic acid. This ingredient helps regulate the pH balance of your skin and keep your pores clear before pimples can even form.[4]\n\nIf you have oily skin, look for a face wash made with 2 percent salicylic acid.\nFor dry skin, choose a sensitive formula that only contains 1 percent.",
                "Carry degreasing pads with you. Pre-moistened cloths containing salicylic acid can be used to cleanse oil from your skin immediately after you work up a sweat.\n\n\nYou do not need water when using these pads.\nWipe the pads over zones that are most likely to get clogged with sweat, including your forehead, nose, and chin.",
                "Choose a good facial lotion. Your skin needs to stay hydrated in order to remain healthy, clear, and free of dead, flaking skin.\n\n\nPick a moisturizer without oil to minimize the risk of clogging your pores.\nFor intensely acne-prone skin, use a moisturizing gel instead of a cream.",
                "Soothe your skin. Your skin can be pimple-free yet still appear red and inflamed. Apply an overnight gel if you have notably sensitive skin.\n\n\nLook for gels containing botanicals like aloe vera.",
                "Exfoliate once or twice a week. Exfoliating products usually contain slightly abrasive ingredients that remove dead skin cells and debris from your pores, thereby removing the environment bacteria needs in order to grow.\n\n\nExfoliating too much can lead to skin that is excessively dry and irritated, however.",
                "Consider using retinol. Retinol-based products are used to minimize the effects of aging and also clear up acne.\n\n\nGradually begin using retinol-based products by applying a night cream once or twice a week until your skin adjusts.",
                "Protect your skin against the sun. Avoid exposing your skin to the sun as often as possible. Wear a hat to shade your face from the sun when you expect to stay out for a prolonged period, and avoid sun-bathing.[5]\n\nYou should also consider apply sunscreen to offer the greatest amount of protection. Most sunscreens are oily by nature, so to reduce the risk of clogging your pores, choose a lotion specifically formulated for use on your face.\nSunlight can damage your skin in the long-run but it can also cause your pores to get clogged, preventing oil from escaping in the process.",
                "Stay active. Exercise regulates hormones, and many acne problems are related to hormonal shifts and surges. This is especially true of breakouts that occur during the teenage years.\n\n\nPlay sports or lift weights if either activity appeals to you. If not, at least go for walks or runs on a regular basis.\nWash your skin after breaking a sweat to prevent your pores from getting clogged.",
                "Get plenty of sleep each night. Sleep regulates the body's hormones and also reduces stress. Aim for 6 to 8 hours each night.",
                "Rest and relax as needed. Stress throws your hormones off, causes you to break into a sweat, and leads to an overall increase in acne. Calm yourself down after a hard day by doing something relaxing. By reducing your stress, you can reduce the number of future breakouts you experience. Possible stress-reducing activities include:\n\n\nTaking a bubble bath\nExercising\nMeditating\nListening to music\nPainting, drawing, or indulging in a calm and expressive activity\nWatching a movie or show\nReading a book",
                "Eat acne-fighting foods. Certain foods can keep your skin hydrated, healthy, free of irritation, and free of acne-causing toxins. Foods and drinks to gravitate toward include:\n\n\nWater and water-rich foods (including many fruits and vegetables)[6]\n\nFoods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, mackerel, seaweed, free-range eggs, walnuts, and dark green leafy vegetables\nFoods rich in flavonoids, like lettuce, citrus fruits, cabbage, lima beans, and kidney beans\nNettles\nArtichokes\nAlfalfa sprouts\nPeppermint\nBeetroot\nRed grapes\nAcai\nFennel\nTofu\nWhole grains\nGreen tea\nAvocado\nGarlic\nTomatoes\nDark berries\nSweet potato",
                "Know which foods to avoid. There are also foods generally linked to an increase in acne breakouts. Foods you should try to stay away from include:\n\n\nRefined grains, like commercial cereal, white bread, and white rice.\nRefined sugars, like chocolate, candy, soda, and cookies\nRich dairy, like milk or cream\nVegetable oils, like corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oils, and sesame oils"

        "How to Act Smart": {
            "intro": "Everyone wants to be smart, but most people are average; that's why it's called average. If you worry that people may be thinking you're not the brightest bulb in the box, there are ways to help improve how others judge your intelligence. Here are some steps you can take to seem more intelligent.",
            "steps": [
                "Listen more and speak less. Take a cue from Abraham Lincoln (that's one smart dude) when he said, \"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.\"[1] If you want to assumed reasonably smart, keep your mouth shut. Talk less and when you do talk, what you say will be valued that much more.\n\n\nIt helps that \"smart\" people are generally viewed as more introverted, as inaccurate as that is. Not only will you have the benefit of the doubt, but you'll have the stereotype on your side, too.",
                "Use proper grammar. \"Mama said I dun need none no book learnin'. Now gid off th' property!\" If you got that, you're probably picturing someone in overalls with a strand of wheat hanging from their upper lip, rifle in hand. Not exactly smart looking, huh? How about, \"Mother said I didn't need any book learning. Now get off the property.\" A little strange (why was mother so against formal education, anyway?), but definitely smarter.\n\n\n\"Proper\" here meaning by the standards of conventional American or British English (or whatever umbrella your dialect falls under). While saying \"y'all\" is totally acceptable and not technically incorrect in certain dialects, it's not okay in others. In order to be truly proper, speak the kind of English they teach you in school.",
                "Pronounce your words fully. It's totally natural to drop the \"g\" from -ing words and to say things like \"coulda\" or \"kinda,\" but if you're really looking to sound smart, those habits will have to be dropped. Slow your speech a bit, say the full words, and speak a bit more formally. People may wonder why you talk like that and the answer? Intelligence.\n\n\n\"I dunno. I think I'm gonna go with 'em to the show fer 'bout an hour,\" is more intelligently said as \"I don't know. I think I'm going to go with them to the show for about an hour.\" And that doesn't take any mental work -- just talking.",
                "Avoid textspeak and mallspeak. OMG, like, really?! LOL. No. Just no. In your new smart-sounding communication, there is no IDK-ing, no inserting \"like,\" \"you know,\" or \"umm\" every third world. Don't do it. If you think you don't do it, spend an hour actually listening to yourself.\n\n\nSeriously. Avoid the abbreviations and the acronyms (like \"totes\" or \"BRB\"). That's text speak and shouldn't even really be used on your phone (especially if you want to keep up the façade). Mallspeak is where, you, like, talk like this, and, umm, like, you fill the empty spaces, with, like, and, umm, rising intonation and it, like, always sounds like you're asking questions when you're, like, really not.\n\nBasically don't talk like you're in Clueless. The \"valley girl\" dialect isn't viewed as particularly intelligent, to say the least.",
                "Stick to what you know. Even Alex Trebek would sound like an idiot if he had to expound on the five ages of the universe. It doesn't matter how smart you are -- if you don't know anything about the topic matter, you won't sound intelligent. So stick to what you know! Don't put pressure on yourself to join in on a conversation about the Glass-Steagall Act if it's not your cup of tea. No one can add valuable input to every conversation.\n\n\nTry to steer the conversation at hand if you're really aching to show your stuff. Maybe you don't know anything about the Glass-Steagall Act but you know a tidbit or two about Roosevelt. Get the conversation about him and jump on it! Find your opening (six degrees of Kevin Bacon style) and grab the wheel. That's how conversations progress, after all!",
                "Quote something. There's an episode of Friends where Monica and Chandler run into Monica's ex-boyfriend, Richard. While Chandler is busting out poop jokes, Richard recites, \"In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.\"[2] Who's the smarter one in this scenario? Quoting that doesn't mean Richard is smart, but it sure makes him look like it!\n\n\nIn case you were curious, that's a Khalil Gibran quote. If you're going to choose things to quote, it's best to stick to poets, classic novelists, and prominent figures of the past -- not Dennis Rodman, Michael Scott, or Carrot Top.",
                "Use \"smart\" words. Just sprinkling in a handful of \"smart\" words can do wonders for the impression you give others. Words like \"hence,\" \"sought,\" \"shall,\" \"divert,\" and \"inquire\" are good alternatives to other, more common words, but look them up to be sure when to use them. If you use them wrong, you'll come across as foolish.\n\n\nIn general, English has a lot of French and German words. Sometimes the French word is \"smarter sounding\" than the German. Instead of saying \"to answer your question\" say \"in response to your question.\" Instead of \"begin,\" choose \"commence.\" \"Understand\" is \"comprehend,\" et cetera ad infinitum.",
                "Express yourself non-verbally. Don't know what to say? Don't say anything at all! Let your face do the talking. Someone starts going off on a soap box you don't understand? Roll your eyes, wave your hand away, and occupy yourself some other way. Some people will question your behavior...and if they do, just run.\n\n\nYou could always put on your \"thinking\" face. A slightly furrowed brow, squinted eyes looking up, maybe a hand near your face. Then ask them to explain further. You want the full argument before you respond.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Act Smart Step 08Bullet01\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a5/Act-Smart-Step-08Bullet01.jpg/aid513716-v4-728px-Act-Smart-Step-08Bullet01.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Don't be a know-it-all. If you're jumping in every sentence and a half to prove just how smart you are, that's not smart. There's a reason Hermione Granger didn't have very many friends throughout Hogwarts. Most people know a bit about a few things and no one knows everything about everything.\n\n\nBe comfortable with your lack of knowledge! Just because you can't recite information about the structure of atoms doesn't mean you're not smart; it just means that's specific knowledge you don't have right now. It's something you can learn later.\nAsk some questions, but not too many. Smart people know a lot, but they don't know everything. They became smart by learning, so it's a good idea to occasionally say something like \"I'm not familiar with that, can you explain\" or \"I hadn't heard that, can you tell me more\"?",
                "Be confident. Politicians aren't geniuses, they're well practiced, intelligent, confident, and charismatic individuals. They speak with conviction and passion and people don't question it. Confidence gets people go to give more weight to what you say. This does not work if what you're saying is obviously wrong, it will make you look like you're trying too hard.\n\n\nThink about it. Two people have the same argument -- one person delivers it slow and with hesitation, fumbling with their words, and not making eye contact with you. The other argues with hand gestures, quickly and with clarity, and shows their undoubted belief in the concept through their passion. Who would you believe?\nBe aware of that nasty voice in your head -- the one that's trying to make you miserable and derail you from feeling smart. We all have one that's telling us we're wrong, beating down our confidence. That's normal. Just know that this voice shouldn't be paid any mind. It's just there to annoy you.",
                "Know there are different kinds of intelligence. Just because you haven't read \"War & Peace\" doesn't mean you're not smart. You could be great at maps, spatial reasoning, or communicating with people. Most people have one type of intelligence they're pretty decent at. What's yours?\n\n\nYou could be smart about nature, music, or even smart about how things move (not everyone can juggle). Maybe you're good with numbers, fixing cars, cooking, or gardening.[3] If you haven't thought about it before, maybe you really are smart.",
                "Know that most people fake it. Recent studies have shown that approximately 70% of people who act smart fake it around others.[4] Know what that means? Those people you're worried about impressing aren't really all that smart -- they're just trying to impress you. Funny how the world works, huh?\n\n\nYou know what that means? You can totally poke holes in their argument if you know where to look. Get confident -- your argument is just as valid as theirs. They just might be more convincing with it.",
                "Question the status quo. Smart people are great at questioning things. Join 'em! Whenever someone presents something to you, question it. Why is it right? Is it rational? Why might people believe it if it weren't true? Is it good or bad? Just or unjust? Not only will you be smart, but you'll have your own opinions, too.\n\n\nWe all get handed our cultures from birth. We get handed a political party, a religion, a belief system, manners, you name it, the adults in our lives shaped us from day one. Be open to the possibility that they were wrong. Consider different points of view. This will make you more confident in your belief system and better able to say why.",
                "Be open-minded. Ignorance is a terrible, terrible thing. If you're close-minded, you're not seeing both sides of the argument and you're unable to put yourself in the other person's shoes. What's smart about that? You got it -- nothing.\n\n\nIt's those people who were open-minded, that questioned the status quo, that have driven every culture forward. If people weren't, we'd still be in a very primitive society, content with where we are. Obviously nothing good about that. And it doesn't take much intelligence to simply be open minded.",
                "Be curious. You don't have to know anything about a topic to have an interesting, intelligent conversation. All you have to do is ask the right questions. In much the same way you would ask a person questions until you find something they really enjoy to get to know them, you ask a person questions to seem intelligent, too. Someone briefly mentions their trip to Antarctica testing theories on anthropogenic climate change? No one would be able to talk about that topic. Time to start asking a lot of questions to show your curiosity and desire to learn.\n\n\nEven if you don't have another person to bounce questions off of, you can get curious by yourself! Are you reading something online and run across a word you don't know? Look it up. A political concept that just is totally over your head? Look it up. If you don't know something, do something about it.",
                "Notice things. You may not be asking someone about their penchant for fatalism, but you can notice tiny things about them that can give them other impressions. Insert little comments about something they mentioned offhand a bit ago or something you noticed in their home. The things we say and do are often indicative of our opinions -- you can put two and two together without them even knowing it.",
                "Form opinions on controversial topics. When your gang starts a heated debate on the current economic crisis, the only thing you have to do to chime in is have an opinion. There's no right or wrong on all these hot-button topics (religion, politics, current events, etc.) -- all you have to do is a bit of research and soul searching. What or who do you align yourself with?\n\n\nWhen it comes to \"controversial celebrity\" topics like Kim Kardashian, a smart person is really not interested enough to have an opinion -- things of that caliber aren't really interesting (or at least you don't admit it). The talk around the watercooler is about the Bachelorette? Nope, sorry, you were watching a documentary on the Ebola crises last night or reading, you've never seen the show, sounds silly.",
                "Look smart. Though this obviously has nothing to do with actually acting or being smart, luckily for most of us, people are easily fooled. Slap on a pair of glasses, keep the make-up to a minimum, throw on a cardigan, don't fancy up your hair, and walk out the door (pants, too). Bam.\n\n\nIt's totally stereotypical, sure, but it may also help you get in the zone! When we feel pretty, we get more confident -- by the same token, if you feel smart, you may act smarter. If nothing else, it's worth a shot.\nDon't make it obvious that you are trying hard to look smart. This will be looked upon negatively.",
                "Keep up on current events. This one's easy. Plop yourself down in front of the TV, grab some popcorn, and turn on the news. Awkward silence at work tomorrow? What does everyone think about Snowden's manifesto? Bonus points if you ask the question and no one bothers to fire it back to you!\n\n\nHit up CNN, BBC, or even your local newspaper. Heck, the AOL homepage. Too much work? Okay, a particularly in-tune Facebook friend's feed. The news is everywhere -- read it, form an opinion, and talk about it! It's not about being smart -- it's about appearing well-informed.",
                "Beef up your vocabulary. Take some time to learn new words. The more words you have in your arsenal, the better you'll be able to express yourself. And the more words you know, the better the chance other people won't know them. Think of words you use a lot and look them up in a thesaurus to find smarter sounding words that mean the same thing. Or just go for a word a day -- you're vocabulary will improve in no time.\n\n\nEnglish is so, so, so, so many words thanks to its history. A quick query into Google about \"smart English words\" warrants pages of results. Just make sure you use them! If you don't, they'll be hard to remember.",
                "Learn some French or Latin phrases. Sprinkling in French and Latin phrases (really any foreign language, but those two are magnificent) can make you sound so sophisticated. There's a certain je ne sais quoi\" about it all, right? You could say that ad nauseum, but what would it all mean? Doesn't matter, anyway. Carpe diem, regardless. Here's a few to get you started:\n\n\n\nJe ne sais quoi - literally, \"I don't know what\"; means an unexplainable thing\n\nAd nauseum - to the point of nausea\n\nCarpe diem - seize the day\n\nIn vino veritas - In wine there is truth\n\nAd hoc - something formed quickly and haphazardly to address a specific problem\n\nAu contraire - on the contrary",
                "Learn something obscure. While it may not come up in everyday conversation, learning everything you can learn about one thing does have its place. Once it does come up, everyone will remember that one time you schooled the entire room on the Korean War. So find something that interests you and dive in! No one can call you dumb -- you just know your specific stuff.\n\n\nPick something from what you already know a little about. Maybe there was something in history class or English class that sparked your interest? A series of novels, a phase in history, a type of plant? It could be anything!",
                "Use the Internet. Seriously, you already are so why not use it to help yourself? Spend an hour on wikiHow researching topics you know zilch about. Go on Wikipedia and begin with one topic and see how far away you can get in six links. Spend your time surfing learning things.\n\n\nDictionary.com has a \"word of the day\" you can sign up for. Stuffyoushouldknow.com is pretty self-explanatory. Get into Memrise, Khan Academy, Coursera, and even CNN, BBC, and any other website that sparks your fancy.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, Memrise.com is games, Khan Academy is sweet videos, and Coursera are courses online you can take for free! You're probably familiar with CNN and BBC. But heck, even Reddit's r/explainlikeimfive is a good place to start!",
                "Get a favorite writer/artist/book. If you don't know much about culture and the arts, all you need to do is find one. Look over famous paintings on the Internet and find one that really speaks to you (did you know some museums even have virtual tours online?). Read one classic novel. Get a favorite and learn about it. As long as you know what you like, you're covered.\n\n\nDon't know where to start? Look at the paintings of Monet, Gauguin, Dali, Pollock, van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir, or Michelangelo. Read Twain, Steinbeck, Shakespeare, Hemingway, Poe, or Faulkner. Read the Spark Notes and see what sounds interesting!",
                "Remember. Knowledge is just high-resolution regurgitation. People who are spouting off things to you are just talking about things they've read or what other people have told them, that's it. So start remembering! Place value on what other people are teaching you. When you value something, you give it a sturdier place in your memory.\n\n\nSo when you spend that time on wikiHow, Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, write stuff down! Try to talk about it with someone that night. Get it cemented in your brain so you can actually use it, instead of it going in one ear and out the other. It's how we learn as children and it's how we learn as adults. Very few things are rocket science. But maybe you're interested in space you probably know a fact or two."

These truths state that life is filled with different types of suffering; suffering has a cause and an end; and you reach Nirvana when you end this suffering. The Noble Eightfold Path outlines the steps you must take to achieve Nirvana in your life. The Four Noble Truths describe the sickness in the human experience, and the Noble Eightfold Path is the prescription that provides healing. Understanding the truths and traveling the path will lead to peace and happiness in life.",
            "steps": [
                "Meditate regularly. Meditation is the key to changing how your mind works and will allow you to travel the path to nirvana. It should be a part of your everyday life. While you can learn to meditate on your own, a teacher can help guide you and apply proper techniques.[1] You can meditate alone, but it is helpful to meditate with other people and under the guidance of a teacher.[2]\n\nYou cannot travel the path without meditating. Meditation will help you better understand yourself and the world.",
                "Have the right view. The Buddhist teachings (i.e. The Four Noble Truths) are the lens that you view the world through. If you are unable to accept the teachings, you will not be able to follow the other steps in the path. The right view and the right understanding is the foundation of the path. See the world as it really is and not as you would like for it to be.[3] You seek to understand reality completely and through an objective lens. This requires you to examine, study, and learn.\n\n\nThe Four Noble Truths are the basis of the right understanding. You must believe that those truths describe things as they really are.[4]\n\nNothing is perfect or permanent. Think critically about situations instead of inserting your personal feelings, desires, and concerns.",
                "Have right intentions. Commit yourself to developing an attitude that is line with your belief system. Act as if all life is equal and deserves to be treated with compassion and love. This applies to yourself and to others. Reject thoughts that are selfish, violent, and hateful. Love and non-violence should should be the rule.[5]\n\nShow regard for all living things (e.g. plants, animals, and people) regardless of their status. For example, you would treat a wealthy person and poor person with the same respect. People from all backgrounds, age groups, races, ethnicity, economic groups should be treated equally.",
                "Speak the right words. The third step is the right speech. When practicing the right speech, you do not lie, slander, gossip, or speak harshly. Instead you speak kind and truthful words.[6] You words should affirm and uplift others. Knowing when to be silent and holding back your words is also important.\n\n\nHaving the right speech is something you practice every day.",
                "Have the right action. Your actions flow out of what is in your heart and in your mind. Treat yourself and other people well.[7] Do not destroy life or steal. Live a peaceful life and help other people live peaceful lives as well. Be honest when you deal with other people. For example, you would not deceive or lie to get ahead or get something that you want.[8]\n\nYour presence and actions should be positive and improve the lives of other people and society.",

Selling weapons, drugs, or working at a slaughterhouse are not acceptable occupations.[9] Whatever profession you choose, you must carry it out with integrity.\n\n\nFor example, if you work in sales, you would not use deception or lies to get people to purchase your product.",
                "Practice the right effort. Putting true effort into anything that you do will lead to success. Rid your mind of negative thoughts and focus on positive thinking. Have enthusiasm for whatever you do (e.g. school, career, friendships, hobbies etc.).[10] You have to consistently practice having positive thoughts as this does not always come naturally. This will prepare your mind to practice mindfulness.[11] The four tenets of right effort are:\n\n\nPrevent evil and unwholesome states (sensual desire, ill will, worry, doubt, restlessness) of from arising\nGet rid of evil and unwholesome states that have already arisen by countering them with good thoughts, redirecting your attention to something else, or confronting the thought and investigating the source of the thought.[12]\n\nProduce good and wholesome states\nMaintain and perfect the good and wholesome states",
                "Practice Mindfulness. Mindfulness allows you to see reality and see things as they really are. The four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena. When you are mindful, you live in the moment and are open to the entire experience.[13] You focus on your present situation not on the future or the past. Be attentive to your body, your feelings, your thoughts, your ideas, and everything around you.[14]\n\nLiving in the present frees you desires from your future and past.\nMindfulness also means being attentive to other people's feelings, emotions, and body.",
                "Focus your mind. Right concentration is the ability to focus your mind on a single object and not be distracted by outside influences.[15] Going through the other parts of the path will allow you concentrate. Your mind will be focused and not filled with stress and anxiety. You will have a good relationship with yourself and the world. Right concentration allows you to view something clearly and as it truly is.\n\n\nConcentration is similar to mindfulness. However, when you concentrate you are not aware of all of the different sensations and feelings. For example, if you are concentrating on an exam, you are only focused on taking the exam. If you were practicing mindfulness during the exam, you would notice how you felt taking the exam, how the other people around you were acting, or how you were sitting during the exam.",
                "Practice Loving Kindness (metta bhavana). Metta means non-romantic love, kindness,and friendliness. It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes.[16]\n\nStage 1- Feel metta for yourself. Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence. You can repeat the phrase \"May I be well and happy.\" to yourself.\nStage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, \"May they be well; may they be happy.\"\nStage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about. You do not like them or dislike them. Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person.\nStage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all. Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them.\nStage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself. Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world.",
                "Practice Mindfulness of Breathing. This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts. Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety.[17] Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap.[18] Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes.\n\n\nStage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10. Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out. Your mind will wander. Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing.\nStage 2- Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling.\nStage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out.\nStage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip.[19]",
                "Affirm and uplift others. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people.[20] Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others. This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them. If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear.",
                "Treat people with compassion. Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people.[21] Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways:[22]\n\nTurn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family.\nMake eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting.\nVolunteer in your community.\nOpen doors for other people.\nBe empathetic towards people. For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset. Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings.",
                "Be mindful. When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment. Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well. For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning.[23] Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it.[24]\n\nIf you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it.\nAs you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes.\nInstead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence. Notice how you feel. Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower?",
                "Identify suffering. Buddha describes suffering differently than you may usually think of it. Suffering is inevitable and is a part of life. Dukkha is the truth that all is suffering. [25] Suffering is typically used to describe things such as sickness, aging, accidents, and physical and emotional pain. Yet, Buddha considers desires(i.e. especially unfulfilled desires) and cravings as suffering as well.[26] These two things are considered the roots of suffering because humans are rarely ever satisfied or content. Once one desire is met, another desire is created. This is a vicious cycle.\n\n\nDukkha means \"that which is difficult to bear.\"[27] Suffering is a large spectrum and includes things that are great and small.",
                "Determine the cause of suffering. Desire and ignorance are the root of suffering.[28] Your unfulfilled desires are the worst type of suffering. For example, if you are sick, you are suffering. While you are sick, you desire to be well. Your unmet desire to be well is a greater form of suffering than just being sick. Any time you desire a thing, opportunity, person, or achievement that you cannot have, you are suffering.[29]\n\nThe only guarantees in life aging, sickness, and death.[30]\n\nYour desires will never be satisfied. Once you achieve or get something that you want, you will begin to desire something else. Your constant cravings keep you from achieving true happiness.[31]",
                "End suffering in your life. Each of the four truths is a stepping stone. If all is suffering and suffering comes from your desires, then the only way to end suffering is by no longer having desires.[32][33] You must believe that you do not have to suffer and that you have the ability to stop the suffering in your life. To end the suffering in your life, you must change your perception and learn to control your desires.\n\n\nControlling your desires and cravings will allow you to live with freedom and contentment.",
                "Attain the end of suffering in your life. The end of suffering can be attained by traveling the Noble Eightfold Path.[34] Your path to nirvana involves can be summed up by three ideas. First, you have to to have the right intentions and mindset. Secondly, you have to live out your right intentions in your everyday life. Lastly, you have to understand true reality and have the correct beliefs about all things.[35]\nThe eightfold path can be divided into three categories: wisdom (right view, right intention), ethical conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and mental cultivation (right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration).[36]\n\nThis path offers guidelines for how to live your everyday life.[37]"

        "wikiHow to Give a Presentation": {
            "intro": "Giving a presentation terrifies most of us, especially when talking before a crowd of people about an unfamiliar topic. Never fear! There are ways to make a good presentation. The more presentations you do, the easier they will become!",
            "steps": [
                "Focus your presentation. Having a long, rambling presentation that is hard to follow is not going to win you any audience interest. You need to make sure that your presentation is clear and focused and that any asides you throw into it are there to back up the main point.[1]\n\nIt's best to have 1 main thesis statement or overarching theme and 3 main points that back-up or flesh-out your main theme. Any more than that and your audience is going to start losing interest. This means that any facts and information that are a part of your presentation should back up these 3 main points and overarching theme.\nFor example: If you're giving a presentation about 17th century alchemy, bringing up the history of alchemy is fine (and probably necessary), but don't mire your audience in its history instead of focusing alchemy in the 17th century. Your 3 points could be something like \"alchemy in public opinion,\" \"famous 17th century alchemists,\" and \"the legacy of 17th century alchemy.\"",
                "Less is more. You don't want to overwhelm your audience with information and important points. Even if they're interested in your topic they'll starting spacing out and then you've lost them. You need to stick to your 3 points and overall point and you need to make sure that you only use the information that you need to support and clarify those points.\n\n\nPick your very best supporting facts, information, or quotes for your presentation. Don't bury your audience in information.",
                "Decide whether to use media or not. It isn't always necessary to use a powerpoint, or visual representation, especially if you're already an engaging speaker and have interesting subject matter. In fact, a lot of times, using visual media simply distracts from the focal point, that is the presentation.\n\n\nMake sure you're using media to enhance your presentation and not to drown it out. The presentation is key. Anything else is just accessorizing.\nFor example: to get back to 17th century alchemy, to back up your information about alchemy in the public opinion, you might want to show images from public pamphlets about the dangers of alchemy and see what people of the time period had to say about it and see what the more famous alchemists had to say about it.\nAlso, you want to make sure that you pick a medium that you are comfortable in and thorough in knowledge. If you don't know a thing about powerpoint, maybe consider writing your main points on a white board, or passing out handouts with your main points and evidence on them.",
                "Practice. This is one that for some reason, lack of time perhaps, people neglect to do and it is absolutely key to giving a good presentation. Running through the presentation before the actual event gives you time work out any kinks or problems with your notes and with your technology and makes the presentation itself go more smoothly.\n\n\nA good tip is to film yourself or audiotape of yourself giving your practice presentation so you can see what distracting verbal and physical tics you have, so that you can work on eliminating them before the presentation itself. (Verbs tics would be things like \"um...\" and \"uh...\" and using \"like\" inappropriately; physical tics are things like shifting your weight from foot to foot or messing with your hair.)\nJust remember that rehearsals usually run about 20% shorter than your actual presentation, so take that into account if you're running on a time limit.",
                "Visualize success. It may seem like a silly thing to do, but visualizing a successful presentation can actually help you achieve a successful presentation. You'll be more inclined towards success if you've been prepping your brain for it. So beforehand, sit somewhere quietly for a few minutes and picture the presentation going well.[2]",
                "Dress appropriately. You want to dress for success. Wearing nicer clothes can help get you into the mindset of giving a good presentation. You also want to be comfortable, however, so you should try to find a reasonable medium between dressing super snazzy and dressing comfortably.\n\n\nFor example, if you aren't comfortable wearing heels, don't wear them just for the presentation. You'll be distracted by your discomfort and that will come across in the presentation. There are plenty of good shoe choices that have no or a low heel.\nClean, nice slacks or a skirt and nice, button-down shirt in neutral colors are always good choices for presentation wear. You also don't particularly want your clothing choice to distract from the presentation, so perhaps avoid that brilliant hot pink shirt.",
                "Deal with the jitters. Pretty much everyone gets nervous about presenting, even when it isn't in front of a bunch of people. That's okay. All you have to do is mask the fact that you're nervous, since you won't be able to avoid the jitters themselves.[3]\n\nBefore the presentation, clench and unclench your hands several times to deal with the adrenaline and then take 3 deep, slow breaths.\nCall up a smile, even if you feel like hurling. You can trick your brain into thinking that you're less anxious than you actually are and you'll also be able to hide your nervousness from your audience.",
                "Engage the audience. One way to make your presentation memorable and interesting is to interact with your audience. Don't act like there's a wall between you and your audience, engage them in the material. Talk directly to them, not at them or at the back wall, but to your audience.\n\n\nMake eye contact with your audience. Don't stare at one particular person, but section up the room and make eye contact with someone in each section on a rotational basis.\nAsk questions of your audience and take questions during your presentation. This will make it more of a conversation and therefore more interesting.\nTell an amusing anecdote to illustrate your point. From the above examples about 17th century alchemy, you could find an amusing alchemical anecdote from the time period, or you could talk about your own forays into alchemy.",
                "Give an engaging performance. Giving an engaging performance isn't the exact same thing as engaging your audience (although, hopefully, your performance will engage your audience). It simply means that you make the performance itself interesting and dynamic.[4]\n\nMove around, but make your movements deliberate. Don't nervously shift your feet (in fact, it's a good idea to imagine that your feet are nailed to the floor except for those times you deliberately choose to move).\nUse your vocal inflections to create a more dynamic presentation. Vary your voice as you're talking. Nobody (ever) wants to sit there and listen to someone drone on and on in dull monotone, no matter how interesting the material (think Professor Binns from Harry Potter; that's what you don't want).\nTry to create a balance between rehearsed and spontaneous. Spontaneous, on the spot, movement and asides can be great as long as you are really comfortable, otherwise they can sidetrack your presentation and make it rambling. Mess around with spontaneous and rehearsed when you're practicing and you'll get a feel for it.",
                "Treat your presentation as a story. To get your audience's interest you'll need to connect them with the material on an emotional level and the best way to do that is to think of your presentation like a story you're telling.[5]\n\nQuickly introduce your topic and don't assume that your audience is familiar with all the terms, especially if your topic is one that isn't widely known.\nFiguring out why you want (or have to) give this presentation will help you work with an overarching story/theme. Maybe you want to pass the class. Maybe you're convincing people to give you money or join you in a philanthropic endeavor or act for a social or political reason. Channel that desire into your presentation. You're answering the question of why they would want to pass you or why they would want to fund you. That's the story you're telling.",
                "Talk more slowly. One of the most frequent things that people do to sabotage their own presentation is talking way too quickly and so many people make this mistake. They get nervous and they whip through their presentation, leaving the audience gasping at the tidal wave of information. Don't do this.\n\n\nHave water with you and take a sip when you feel you're going too fast.\nIf you have a friend in the class or meeting, arrange with them beforehand that they will let you know with a signal whether you're talking too quickly. Look over their way occasionally and check your progress.\nIf you find that you're running out of time and you haven't finished, simply drop or summarize your leftover material. Acknowledge the leftover material as something that can be discussed later or in the Q&A.",
                "Have a killer closing. The beginning and the closing of a presentation are the parts that people tend to remember, so you want to make sure that you end with a punch to the gut (figuratively speaking; don't hit your audience). You'll need to reiterate those 3 most important points and make sure the listener knows why they should care about your topic.\n\n\nMake it clear what the listeners now know and why it is important that they have this new information.\nConclude with examples or stories about your main point and take home message. You might want a slide which summarizes your presentation. For example, you might conclude with a story about the nature of alchemy in the modern era (perhaps in a film) to show its malleable nature."

            "intro": "Nowadays, getting invited to a formal event is a rarity and, for many of us, a challenge. What do we wear? How can a guy find a tuxedo that looks sharp? While there are many styles of tux available, choosing one that is appropriate for the event and for your physical build is important. Knowing the unspoken rules of formal wear, choosing the best style, and adding the right accessories will enhance your appearance and leave the impression that you’re well-groomed and properly dressed for the occasion.",
            "steps": [
                "Figure out if “black tie” is right for you. Whether for a wedding, prom, or formal event, the tuxedo is a classic look that exudes style. The tux in its most basic form sports simple lines similar to a normal man's suit, but with the addition of silk bands on the outside hem of each trouser leg. The lapels on the jacket are also often fashioned with silk, helping to provide a more formal look.\n\n\nIn the contemporary US, tuxedos are usually considered the “gold standard” for formal wear.\nIt might surprise you, however, that tuxes – called black tie attire for the black bowtie – are neither the most formal in men’s dress wear nor always appropriate for important occasions.[1]",
                "Learn to tell the tuxedo apart from other forms of dress attire. Historically, there is a sort of hierarchy of menswear. Tuxedos actually grew out of was, for the time, relaxed evening wear as an alternative to the tailed frock coat. “Black tie,” then, is only one kind of “formal wear,” the other being the even more formal “white tie,” a similar outfit with white bowtie, tails, and often tophat.[2]\n\nWhite tie attire is usually reserved for the most fancy or formal events, like debutante balls, state dinners, and galas.\nKeep in mind that black tie is also not “day wear.” According to tradition, events that occur during the evening call for either white or black tie, while daytime events call for day wear like morning dress or a man’s business suit.[3]\n\nMorning suits are worn more often in Britain and feature a black or grey cutaway or morning coat, non-matching grey trousers—sometimes striped, buff waistcoat, tie, and often tophat.[4]\n\nMorning suits also come in a hierarchy, from formal morning dress to less formal morning suit and even the semi-formal “stroller,” which has no tails.",
                "Note the time of day. When will your upcoming event occur? In general if your event is during the daytime, you should go with day wear like a morning suit. If it is after dark, you are safe to go with black or white tie formal evening wear.\n\n\nThe rule governing the proper forms of dress has to do with when the event ends. So, for example, if you are attending a wedding that starts during the day but ends after sundown, you can choose evening wear.[5]",
                "Check your invitation. Often event invitations will give instructions on dress. Pay close attention to the wording so that you can determine whether or not you will need a tuxedo. Parsing the language can sometimes take a bit of effort.\n\n\nFor instance, an invitation calling for “formal wear” does not necessarily mean a tux. Formal wear refers to a complete suit – tie, cuff links, and the works – but, as noted, can also include white tie or morning wear.\nA black tie event means that you will be expected to wear a tux, so get ready for fittings. Showing up in anything else would be a faux pas.\n“Black tie optional” means just that – if you’d like, you can wear a tuxedo.\n“Semi-formal” is a notch down from formal, and means that tuxedos are not required. Here, you’d be better to settle on a dark suit for evening events.",
                "Identify the most flattering style. When selecting a tuxedo, keep in mind that your physical build will have a big influence on what suit to choose. Getting a tux that fits you well is the most difficult and important part of looking great; an ill-fitting tux can make you look sloppy or crumpled.\n\n\nFor instance, a double-breasted jacket will look better on men that are slim and somewhat tall, as the design adds some substance to his appearance.\nFor men who are shorter or wider in the chest and stomach areas, a single-breasted tuxedo is usually a better option.\nA jacket design that includes peak lapels is pretty timeless and will provide a sense of being stylish without being a slave to passing fads.",
                "Get a sharp jacket. As a rule, the tux jacket should fit much like a suit jacket: i.e. the ideal fit will be close but not pinch or restrict your movement. The back should cover your bottom to its lowest curve.[6]\n\nThe jacket shoulders should fit snugly with fairly high armholes. Shoulder padding should not extend past your shoulder tips, otherwise the jacket is likely too big.[7][8]\n\nWith arms at your sides, the arms of the jacket should cover your wrist bone. They should reveal no more than one half-inch of your shirt sleeves.[9]",
                "Pick well fitting trousers. Tuxedo trousers are fairly straightforward. They are black, made from the same material as the jacket, and have a single strip of satin down the outer leg called the “braid.” Choose trousers that are an exact color match with your jacket.[10]\n\nTuxedo trousers should be highwaisted so that there is not gap with whatever waist-covering you choose, either a waistcoat or cummerbund. They have no belt-loops but should either be worn with suspenders or fastened with clasps.\nThe trousers should also have no cuffs. Some varieties come pleated, but many men feel that plain fronts provide a more elegant look.",
                "Choose the color carefully. You might be tempted to stand out a bit with a colored tuxedo, perhaps white, blue, or purple. Make this decision carefully before you act. The basic black tuxedo is standard for just most formal occasions and, unlike a colored suit, will not look outdated after 10, 20, or 30 years.\n\n\nIn general, most fashion experts warn against colored tuxedos as novelties. Think the blue and orange tuxes in “Dumb and Dumber.”[11]\n\nTwo exceptions to the color rule are midnight blue and burgundy (for the jacket only). Both are acceptable for formal events. Midnight blue is a dark navy blue that appears blacker than black in the night time. Burgundy can be a nice change of pace for those who often attend formal events and want something to switch out for the black jacket on occasion.\nThe white tuxedo is a difficult proposition. White tuxes began as a “warm weather” alternative to the heavier and hotter black tux. While some can pull off the look well, others, especially those with fair skin, look washed out. Still others feel that white tuxes make the wearer look like a waiter.[12]",
                "Have the tux tailored, if necessary. The most important part of selecting a tux is probably getting the shoulders right. The rest can be fairly cheaply altered by a tailor so that everything “pops” as it should, depending, again, on your body type.\n\n\nMany tuxes will need three basic alterations: shortened sleeves, tailored pants, and a “suppressed” waist—if it suits the wearer.[13]\n\nOff-the-rack jackets often have sleeves that are too long. Tux pants, likewise, also normally run too long. You may need to get both shortened. Note that many fashionistas disapprove of cuffed tux pants.[14]\n\nWaist “suppression” is a pinching off of the tux waist to accentuate the lines of your figure. Yes, men have figures – naturally “V-shaped” torsos. You don’t want the tux to give you a boxy look, so consider this alteration, if need be.[15]",
                "Find the right shirt. Getting the right shirt seems simple, no? After all, it’s just a shirt. You will be surprised at how much variety there are in tuxedo shirts, from color to collar and cuffs and texture. Choose one that you like and that also goes well with your suit.[16]\n\nCrisp white is an excellent choice with just about any tuxedo, matching almost any color.\nTux shirts can have different kinds of colors. A wing collars are starched, high collars with small points that stick out under your chin and that create a more formal appearance. There are also normal turn-down collars, which is a better choice if you want to direct attention away from your neck.\nThe “bosom” of the shirt is another site for choice. While some shirts are plain, others have vertical pleats and still others have pique, a special fabric that looks somewhat like honeycomb. Some purists argue that pique should only be worn with tails, however.[17]\n\nThe shirt also has different options for fastening: button covers or studs. Button covers are slotted disks that slid over regular shirt buttons, while studs act like buttons themselves. Both give a splash of black on the white shirt background.\nFinally, there are cuffs. Should you choose regular cuffs or French cuffs? It is ultimately up to you, but many purists argue that French cuffs are traditional for evening wear.[18]",
                "Choose a classic tie. Traditionally, tuxedos are worn with a black silk, self-tie bowtie. More modern cuts now include long ties, also in black silk, which might appeal to people looking for a different, more fashion forward look.[19]\n\nWhile a long tie is not against the rules of black tie, some people argue that it does not work as well. For one thing, the long tie moves the eye away from the face. It’s association with business suits might also “lower” your look to that of an informal black suit.\nYou can’t go wrong with the black bow tie, but keep in mind too that bowties come in a number of varieties and styles. These include butterfly bowties, semi-butterfly, straightedge, and pointed.\nClip -ons or pre-tied ties are convenient, but try to learn how to tie your own, especially if you go to formal occasions with some frequency.",
                "Cover your waist. Tuxedos are always worn with a waist covering, either a more traditional waistcoat or a cummerbund. These coverings should not be worn together. There are also some unspoken rules about how and when to wear them.\n\n\nThe traditional waistcoat is the classic look, either in its single or double breasted forms, and differs somewhat in cut from the three-piece suit waistcoat. Namely, it is cut low and wide and has shawl lapels.[20]\n\nCummerbunds are pleated sashes that wrap around the waist and is usually made of the same silk fabric as the tux’s braid and lapel facings.\nThe waist covering should conceal your waistband all the way around.\nCummerbunds tend to look best when they are the same color as the whole ensemble. Avoid choosing a flashy color or wearing one with a long tie.[21]\n\nIn general, the fabric that makes up your cummerbund should be the same as your bow tie. Some purists match the cummerbund, tie, lapel facing, and trouser stripe. If all are black silk grosgrain, you can't go wrong.",
                "Keep the shoes simple. Choose a basic pair of lace-up patent leather shoes that are the same color as the trousers, jacket and socks. This approach helps to maintain the unified look from head to toe, preventing any sudden jarring lines.[22]\n\nFormal “pumps” or “opera shoes” are an option. This shoes are made from highly polished patent leather and have either a pinched or flat bow on top. However, some fashion experts advise that formal pumps are actually more suited to white-tie dress.\nIf one wishes, pumps made from velvet—with or without embroidery—may be used in lieu of patent pumps and are less formal.\nA simple pair of calf leather black cap toes or whole cuts shined to a beautiful luster are more than appropriate. Stay away from brogueing, suede, boots, etc. These shoes can also be used for less formal events, so are a great choice if you're limited in your budget.",
                "Add other accessories with care. Accentuating your outfit with a kerchief, pocket watch, or boutonniere can really make the tuxedo “pop” in all the right ways. Be mindful of what is considered acceptable, however, and try not to overdo it.[24]\n\nKerchiefs or pocket squares will look best in white, and preferably in silk.\nFor black tie, you can wear either a wrist or pocket watch. Try to get one that matches the color of your button studs and cuff links.\nIf you’d like to wear a hat, don’t go for the top hat – this is considered appropriate only for white tie attire. Go for a fedora or a homburg instead.\nWhen in doubt, choose accessories that are same color as the trousers and jacket."

        "wikiHow to Terminate an Easement": {
            "intro": "An easement is a legal interest that one party has over the real property (land) of another person. For example, you may create an easement to allow a utility company to lay wires across your land; you may create an easement to allow a neighbor to drive across your land to reach theirs; or you may create an easement to allow a neighbor to park somewhere on your land. Easements are created in a variety of ways and they are most often recorded in an applicable registry of deeds, which is where interests in real property are recorded. When you no longer have use for the easement, there are a number of ways that you can terminate it. Choose the method that best suits your needs and follow the directions in order to adequately terminate your easement.",
            "steps": [
                "Assess the current easement. If your easement includes a provision stating that it will be terminated on a certain date or at the occurrence of a certain event, then your easement will terminate when that date comes or when that event occurs. Look through your easement documents for one of these provisions and understand how the provisions works. For example:\n\n\nYour easement might state: \"This easement will terminate on June 5, 2015.\" If this provision exists, your easement will cease to exist on June 5, 2015. In order to be effective, this date must be certain and explicit and should not be open ended (e.g., \"this easement will terminate sometime in the next five years\").\nYour easement might also state: \"This easement will terminate when Party Y no longer needs to use the access road to haul lumber from their property.\" In this situation, your easement will terminate when Party Y no longer uses the access road to haul lumber.",
                "Notify the other party. Once you have identified and understand your easement's termination provision, you should notify the other landowner of its termination. This is important as they may think your easement is still effective and may continue to use it. While you are not obligated to notify the other party to the easement in this situation, it will make your termination process smoother and more beneficial to both parties of the easement. Also, notifying the other landowner will give you an opportunity to discuss the termination provision and will allow you to agree on the easement's termination.\n\n\nIn some instances, you or the other party may want to extend the life of an easement and notifying the other party will allow you to have this conversation. If this is the case, negotiate with the other party and come to an acceptable agreement.",
                "Record your easement's termination. Once you and the other party are in agreement that you are going to terminate the easement by expiration, get this agreement in writing and record an easement termination document with the applicable registry of deeds.[1] Because a lot of easements are recorded interests in real property, if you do not record its termination, the easement may still appear on a title search and may affect the land's value and potential uses.[2]\n\nYou can usually find an easement termination document by going to your county's court website or by calling your county's clerk of courts and asking for help.[3] When you look on the website or call the clerk of courts, you will be looking for, or asking for, an easement termination template you can use to record a terminated easement.\nTo record something, you will have to take your real estate document terminating the easement to your recorder's office and pay a fee.[4] The document will then be given a number and a time-stamp indicating when the document was recorded.[5] It is then filed with any other documents that have been recorded on that specific piece of property.\nRecording documents provides a traceable chain of title to a specific piece of property, including any other interests that may exist on that piece of property (e.g., mortgages, liens, and easements), and it is therefore incredibly important that you record documents quickly and accurately.[6] Because of the importance of recording, you should consult an experienced real estate attorney whenever you are going to record something. He or she will be able to help you through the process and will ensure you accomplish the goals you set out to accomplish.",
                "Speak with the other party. An easement is terminated by release when the dominant estate (landowner that is benefited by the easement - the one using the easement) grants a release of its easement rights to the servient estate (landowner that is burdened by the easement - the one allowing someone else to use their land). This method of termination through written agreement is the most effective long term and will cause the least controversy in the future.\n\n\nIf you are interested in terminating an easement through a release, and you are the dominant estate holder, begin by contacting the servient estate holder and telling them you are going to release your easement rights. In this situation, the other party has no say in what happens because you are simply stating that you are no longer going to enforce or use the easement.\nIf you are interested in terminating an easement through a release, and you are the servient estate holder, you will have to ask the other party to release their rights under the easement. Here, you may have an opportunity to negotiate a deal but may have to provide something of value in order to have the other party release their rights. For example, you may have to provide financial compensation, or maybe another easement, in order for the other party to agree to release their rights under the easement. However, it is not unheard of for another party to simply agree to release their rights, particularly if they do not use the easement a lot and if it does not burden them to release their rights.",
                "Obtain your agreement in writing. Once you agree to a release, the termination agreement MUST be in writing. Also, in the event there are multiple dominant estate holders (e.g., a parcel of land is owned by three separate individuals), every dominant estate holder must agree to the release. When you draft this document, be sure you clearly identify the properties involved, the rights being released, and all the parties to the agreement.",

                "Stop using the easement or block use of the easement. Depending on whether you are the dominant estate holder or the servient estate holder, you will have the option to terminate an easement by either abandonment or prescription. Depending on which party you are, the first step in terminating an easement in these manners is to either stop using the easement or to block use of the easement.\n\n\nIf you are the dominant estate holder, you can terminate an easement through abandonment. The first step in terminating an easement through abandonment is to cease to use the easement at all. This means you cannot do what it is the easement allows you to do. For example, if you have an easement that allows you to drive over someone's land to get to your own, and you want to terminate the easement through abandonment, you must cease to drive across the other person's land in order to get to your own.\nIf you are the servient estate holder, you can terminate an easement through prescription. The first step in terminating an easement through prescription is to block the other party's use of the easement. For example, if you have allowed another landowner to drive across your driveway in order to get to their land, you could put up a fence across your driveway and not allow the other party to get through.",
                "Act in a way that shows you are trying to terminate the easement. Once you have either stopped using the easement or blocked the use of an easement, depending on which party you are, you will have to either show an intent to relinquish your easement rights or you will have to block the other party's use of the easement in an open manner. If you do this, the easement will be terminated.\n\n\nIf you are the dominant estate holder, while you are not using the easement, you must also show some intent to relinquish your rights under the easement. For example, apart from not using the easement, you may also tell the other land owner that you do not need the easement anymore.\nIf you are the servient estate holder, apart from blocking the other party's use of the easement, you must also do so openly. This means you must block use in an obvious way, so that if the other land owner were to inspect the land, he or she would notice and become aware of your blocking. For example, putting a locked fence in front of your driveway is likely considered open. However, putting a small log that can easily be removed in front of your driveway may not meet this requirement.",

                "Negotiate with the other party. When an easement is terminated by a merger, the dominant and servient estates come under common ownership. This is the case because an owner cannot have an easement over his or her own land. In order to start this process, contact the other parties involved and negotiate with them to purchase their land. Terminating an easement in this manner is uncommon unless you or the other landowners were already planning on selling their land. It is uncommon because you would normally not purchase a parcel of land simply to terminate an easement.

        "How to Clean a Hummingbird Feeder": {
            "intro": "A hummingbird feeder should be cleaned regularly to make sure it's safe for birds. Rinse the feeder with hot water each time it is filled. For regular cleanings, you can boil your feeders in a pot of water if they can handle that without deforming. This removes sugar residue well. Rinse the feeder after boiling because some sugar liquid will remain in the water used to boil. If your feeder can't be boiled then you will need to use mild cleaners such as white vinegar or peroxide more often. However, in the event you see black mold, you will need to soak with vinegar and peroxide for a longer time — until the residue has been destroyed. Alternatively, you can use diluted bleach but it is very important to remove all bleach residue before refilling the feeder. Work on maintaining the cleaner after cleaning it by changing the nectar regularly and deep cleaning it once a month. If you don't keep the nectar fresh it will ferment. This will damage the birds' organs. Fermented liquid can remain clear. You can't rely on cloudiness to tell you it's time to change it. Black mold will happen if a feeder has been neglected even more and it will kill the birds more quickly than spoiled nectar will.",
            "steps": [
                "Pour out all the nectar. As you likely stock your feeder with nectar, make sure to remove that before cleaning the feeder. You should simply pour the nectar down the drain. Once birds have fed in the liquid it will contain mold and other contaminants so do not save unused sugar liquid from inside of the feeders. You can make more nectar later with simple sugar and water or restock the feeder with store-bought nectar. If your buy nectar from a store choose the colorless kind, not the kind that is dyed red. Birds are attracted to the red feeder parts and do not need to ingest unnecessary petroleum dyes. The birds prefer cane sugar over beet sugar and you should never use anything except cane or beet sugar.[1]",
                "Disassemble the feeder. You may need the manufacturer's guidelines to disassemble your feeder. However, disassembling a feeder is often self-explanatory. You can usually see the knobs and screws that must be undone to take the feeder part.[2]\n\nIf you are at all unsure, however, you should consult the guidelines to make sure you do not damage your feeder. If you lost the guidelines, you can type the name of your feeder into a search engine. You may be able to find a copy of the guidelines online. Some feeders, though, recommend using soap. Soap is not effective at removing black mold and soap is hard to remove without leaving residue that will harm the birds' stomachs.",
                "Select a cleaner. Usually, bleach is not necessary unless there is black mold in the feeder. For the most part, weaker cleaners like peroxide and vinegar work best as they're less likely to leave behind harmful residue.[3]\n\nUnless you see mold, opt for white vinegar or 3% hydrogen peroxide as your cleaner. Vinegar should be diluted with water. Use two parts water to one part vinegar.[4]\n\nYou can also use simple dish soap. However, you should boil your feeder in a large pot of water to remove all soap residue because even a small amount of soap damages the stomach lining of the birds by attacking the stomach cells. If your feeder can't be boiled without deformation then don't use soap or use very little and soak the feeder in a large pot of water, stirring occasionally. Then rinse it very thoroughly.",
                "Soak your feeder. Fill up your sink with your chosen cleaner. Allow your feeder to soak for several hours. This will remove any toxins and make it easier to scrub off any grime.[5]",
                "Scrub down the interior of your feeder. You will need a thin bottle brush to get into the various nooks and crannies of the feeder. Scrub the interior of your feeder with the bottle brush. You want to remove any nectar or sugar residue, as this can spoil and contaminate new nectar. Boiling the feeder, if it can be boiled without deforming, is a way of removing sugar residue without scrubbing. If you prefer not to scrub and have some mold, you can soak the feeder in an active chemical bath like vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. If soaked long enough, all biofilms (mold and such) should be destroyed. Remember that scrubbing does not always remove microscopic material. [6]\n\nAfter being soaked, residue should come off easily. You should not have to scrub with too much force.",
                "Rinse the feeder completely. Rinse the feeder under hot, running tap water. Rinse each part of the feeder until the water runs clear. It's very important to rinse the feeder completely in order to keep harmful residue from getting into hummingbird nectar.[7]",
                "Allow it to dry completely. Set the feeder in a dry, safe place in your home. Allow it to air dry completely before reassembling it and putting it back in place. How long this will take depends on the humidity of your region. It can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight.[8]",
                "Dilute your bleach. If there is black mold in your hummingbird feeder, you will need to clean it with bleach, peroxide, or vinegar. You should never use bleach without diluting it first, as this can be dangerous. You should also make sure to wear gloves when handling bleach and have adequate ventilation. Vinegar and peroxide are weaker so they will take longer to remove the black mold. However, they have the advantage of not creating toxic dioxin chemicals by reacting with organic compounds like sugar.[9]\n\nTo dilute bleach, mix a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. It's easiest to put your bleach and water in a large bucket.",
                "Soak the feeder in the bleach for an hour. This is important to remove any mold and spores that could potentially harm hummingbirds. Submerge all parts of your bird feeder in the bleach solution. Allow them to sit for an hour.[10]\n\nRemember to wear gloves when working with bleach.",
                "Clean the feeder with a bottle brush. Keeping your gloves on, remove the parts of the bird feeder from the bleach. Clean each part of the feeder with a bottle brush.[11]\n\nMake sure to scrub off any traces of black mold. You do not want any black mold on the feeder when you put it back in place.\nWhere gloves for the duration of the cleaning process.",
                "Rinse the feeder thoroughly. It's vital to rinse the feeder as bleach can be dangerous to birds. Run the feeder under hot water until the water runs clear. Because bleach reacting with organic compounds like sugar can create very toxic dioxin chemicals, it is highly-recommended to boil the feeder in a large pot of water after rinsing it to ensure all traces of bleach residue are removed. If your feeder has a type of plastic that cannot be boiled then soak the feeder in a large pot of water for several hours, stirring periodically.[12]",
                "Refill the feeder. After bleaching a feeder, you do not need to let it air dry. You can simply refill it and put it back in place. However, if the feeder is very wet, you can pat it dry slightly with a towel before putting it back in place.[13]",
                "Clean the feeder at the right frequency, depending on the season. In the warmer months, feeders will need to be cleaned more often. In 90F or higher weather it may even be necessary to replace the liquid twice daily. Fermentation happens very quickly. Do not place hummingbird feeders in locations where they receive direct sunlight as it greater speeds up spoilage. In weather with temperatures in the 80s it is a good idea to change the liquid daily. In the 70s the liquid may last more than a day. Remember, you can't rely on liquid cloudiness to know it's time to change the liquid. Clear-looking liquid can be too fermented already. Beer looks clear but it's extremely fermented. [14]",
                "Replace the nectar regularly. Watch the nectar closely and throw it away when necessary. How long nectar lasts depends on the ambient temperature, how clean the feeder was before it was refilled, how many ports are open to let air in, and whether or not it gets direct sunlight. [15]\n\nIn high heat situations or when the feeder is in direct sunlight, nectar can go bad in less than a day.",
                "Deep clean the feeder at least once every seven days in hot weather. Check the feeder periodically for a greasy residue. This can indicate that there is black mold. The feeder should be boiled, if it is made of parts that can be boiled, more often than it is deep-cleaned. When you deep clean the feeder periodically you have the option of boiling the feeder three times in a row for 30 minutes each time, allowing it to cool. This will kill mold spores which are very resistant to being killed by boiling. You can also soak the feeder in hydrogen peroxide or vinegar for an hour or more. If you notice black mold growing on the feeder that is especially bad and requires soaking in vinegar, peroxide, or a 1 part bleach 10 parts water liquid. You should not see any black mold on the feeder after soaking. If you see it then continue to soak until it has dissolved. [16]"

                "Launder the clothing item. Use a stain remover product on the previously stained area, and then launder the item according to the washing instructions on the tag. The stain should be completely gone and the item ready to wear once it is dry.",
                "Wipe off wet polish immediately. If you can catch wet nail polish before it dries on upholstery, you'll have a much easier time removing it. Use a paper towel or cloth to wipe off as much of the wet polish as you can.\n\nDon't smear the polish so it covers, even more, surface area on the upholstery; rather, use the paper towel to wipe it off with short swipes that don't spread the polish around.\nUse the most absorbent cloth or paper towels you can, so you're leaving as little polish as possible to soak into the upholstery.",
                "Dab the area with acetone. Use a cotton swap or another tool that allows the precise application to put a few drops of acetone on the stained area. Be sure to apply it only on the stained area.\n\nYou may want to do a test dab on a part of the upholstery that's usually hidden. Acetone reacts with some types of fabric, including those containing acetate or triacetate, and could make the stained area look worse if you aren't careful.\nDo not pour the acetone onto the stained fabric since it's harder to control where it flows if you don't use an applicator like a cotton swab or the corner of a paper towel.",
                "Use a clean cloth to blot the polish. Blot it over the stained area carefully, and then use a clean section of the towel to blot it again. Apply more acetone and continue blotting until the stain has been removed.",
                "Rinse the area with warm water. Use a sponge to wash the area to remove traces of acetone or hydrogen peroxide. Let the upholstery dry completely before using.",
                "Use hydrogen peroxide. Some fabrics that don't react well with acetone may perform better if you use the same strategy with hydrogen peroxide.\n\nDab the area with peroxide, blot it with a clean towel and repeat until the stain is gone.\nHydrogen peroxide can act as a bleaching agent, so test it on an unnoticeable area of the upholstery before using it on the stained area.",
                "Try hairspray. Spray it on the bristles of an old toothbrush, and then use a circular motion to remove the stain from the fabric.",
                "Use bug spray. Some say that bug repellent, the type you spray on your body and clothes to keep mosquitoes and other bugs away, works like a charm to remove nail polish stains. Spray it on an old toothbrush, then apply the brush in a circular motion to gently scrub away the stain.",
                "Rinse and wash. No matter what method you use, be sure to rinse the previously stained area well to get rid of the traces of the substance you used to remove the nail polish."

            "intro": "Budgies (budgerigars) are wonderful birds to keep as pets. They are very smart and intelligent, and make excellent companions.[1] Budgies can become very skilled talkers.[2] Although teaching your budgie to talk will take some time, teaching him this skill will allow you to develop a deep and enjoyable relationship with him.[3]",
            "steps": [
                "Place your budgie’s cage near human activity. Budgies learn to talk by mimicking the intonations of the words they hear.[4] Choose an area of your home, such as your living room or family room, where your budgie would be able to hear human voices.\n\n\nYour kitchen is likely another hub of human conversation, but the fumes from nonstick appliances are extremely toxic to birds. Do not place your budgie’s cage in the kitchen.\nSimilar to wild budgies learning the language of their flock, your budgie will want to learn the language of his human flock.[5] Exposing him to human voices will help him learn human language.",
                "Bond with your budgie. Developing a bond with your budgie is essential to teaching him how to talk. The more bonded your budgie is to you, the more effort he will put into learning how to talk and communicate with you.[6]\n\nSpending quiet time in the same room (e.g., reading, watching television) as your budgie is a good way to start the bonding process. This will help him feel more comfortable around you, if he is not comfortable already.[7]\n\n\nHand taming your budgie and teaching him to step up are other good ways to bond with your budgie. In addition, a tamed budgie is more likely than an untamed budgie to learn how to talk.[8]\n\nSpend time bonding with your budgie every day.[9]",
                "Separate your budgies. If you have multiple budgies in a cage, they will likely prefer to interact with each other, rather than with you.[10] If you want to teach any or all of them talk, you will need to work with them individually, away from their cage mates.\n\n\nKeep in mind, though, that the more they interact with each other and make budgie sounds, the harder it will be for you to teach them to talk.\nIt is ideal to have only one budgie in the house if you want to teach a budgie to talk.",
                "Learn how to talk to your budgie. When teaching your budgie to talk, it is not just about what you say, but how you say it.[11] Importantly, you should speak to your budgie enthusiastically—the more excited you are when you speak to him, the more excited and motivated he will be to talk back to you.[12]\n\nIf possible, hold your face close to your budgie when you talk to him. Your budgie will likely stare intently at your mouth when you speak. He may even put his face up to your mouth.[13]\n\nYou will know he is in ‘learning mode’ when his pupils dilate as he focuses on your mouth. [14]",
                "Say individual words to your budgie. Call out the name of different items in your home (e.g., chair, table, couch) when you talk to your budgie.[15] You can also name other people in your home, as well as other pets.[16]\n\nGreet your budgie with ‘hi,’ and say ‘goodbye’ to him when you leave the room.[17] Repeating these words each time you greet or leave him will help him learn these words and with what they are associated.",
                "Say short phrases to your budgie. In addition to singular words, you can also teach your budgie to talk by repeating short phrases and sentences to him. For example, you can say ‘good bird’ when he steps up onto your finger.[18] You can also ask him a question like ‘Is that fun?’ or ‘Are you having fun?’ when he is playing with his toys.[19]\n\nTalking to him when you change out his food and water is also helpful. You could try saying ‘Here is your food’ or ‘Would you like some food?’ when you are feeding him.\nThe better your budgie can associate certain words (or sets of words) with specific actions, the better he will learn how to talk.[20]",
                "Respond to your budgie when he tries to talk. When your budgie tries to say words at first, you may not be able to understand him—his may mumble his words.[21] Regardless of whether his words are intelligible, give him verbal praise and try to repeat back whatever he ‘says’ to you.[22]\n\nYou should also respond to him if he uses his behavior to ask for something. For example, if he is making motions as if he has to go to the bathroom, say something like ‘You need to go to the bathroom,’ and then take him to his bathroom spot.[23]\n\nResponding to him with words and actions that correspond to his body language will also help him learn to talk."

            "intro": "Rinsing hair with beer, due to its high vitamin B and natural sugar content, can add volume and shine to all hair-types.[1] Chamomile tea, renowned for hair brightening and lightening properties, can boost blonde tones and cut brassiness. Used together or individually, these two ingredients act as natural conditioners that will leave your hair soft, shiny, and volumized.",
            "steps": [
                "Shampoo your hair, it's an important first step. Shampoo is used to get everything clean before conditioner. Be sure to scrub your scalp and not just your hair.[2]",
                "Ask a stylist about which shampoo to use. In general, however, there are a few types of hair to work with and specific shampoos that are most beneficial.\n\n\nFine hair is naturally thin, and needs volume. Conveniently, the shampoo for this type of hair is calling a volumizing shampoo.\nCurly hair is, by nature, generally drier. Because of that, it's often recommended to use shampoo specifically tailored for that dryness.[3]\n\nNatural oils, like coconut, are great for dry hair. Several other oils, such as grapeseed oil, help replenish the moisture.\nHair that produces oil in abundance (i.e. oily hair) does not need extra moisturizing products. Look for shampoo specifically designed for oily hair, which will also treat dandruff conditions.",
                "Squeeze any excess water from your hair. Water, in and of itself, works on the cuticles. Selecting cold or warm water is inconsequential as long as the shampoo is fully removed.[4] Because moisture is still required for whatever type of conditioner you use, be sure not to get all water from the hair.",
                "Condition your hair to provide moisture and detangle it. Conditioner works on a molecular level by binding the dead cells of the cuticles together, at which point they are lying more closely and look less ragged.[5] It's important to use conditioner since shampoo strips the hair. Some recommend conditioning each time you shampoo, but conditioning too much could make your hair listless and slick.[6][7]",
                "Use the appropriate amount of conditioner. Depending on your hair type, you may have to use trial and error to determine the amount. If your hair remains oily afterwards, too much conditioner was used. Too dry? Too little was used. Ultimately, the ideal amount used is about the size of a quarter.[8]",
                "Work in the conditioner correctly. Believe it or not, there is a right and wrong way to condition your hair. Using conditioner incorrectly could have detrimental effects.[9]\n\nThe conditioner needs approximately one-to-two minutes in hair before being rinsed out.\nStart where hair is at its worst. Hair is the driest, most damaged, and oldest (naturally) at the bottom. Starting at the top may lead to an oily scalp.\nContinue application of the conditioner until about two-to-three inches away from the scalp.\nBe sure to thoroughly rinse hair so as to unclog hair follicles and keep hair shiny.",
                "Flatten or boil your beer. Pour the beer into a container and let it sit, or put it in a pot and boil it. Either method not only gets rid alcohol that can strip hair of its natural oils[10], but it also removes carbonation that, when combined with water, can create a high mineral content environment - also known as \"hard water\" - that hinders the effects of shampoo.[11]\n\nThe type of beer you use is based on personal preference, so try experimenting with different brews to see which works best for your hair.\nTry an organic beer to narrow down chemicals and other unknowns put into typical highly processed, commercial beers.[12]\n\nCut down on the beer smell by adding some apple cider vinegar, jojoba oil, some essential oils, or even a small amount of common conditioner.[13]",
                "Pour the beer slowly through your hair. The beer has proteins and vitamins that help make hair healthy, and the malt and hops strengthen the cuticles, helping to repair hair damaged from blow-drying, coloring, and curling.[14]",
                "Ensure all your hair is fully saturated. Start from the bottom and work your way towards the scalp. Be sure to let the beer sit in the hair at least a couple of minutes.[15]",
                "Rinse your hair thoroughly. At this point, your hair is ready to be dried and styled, or you can condition further with a chamomile rinse.",
                "Brew some fresh chamomile tea and let it cool. Other than the impact on hair, using chamomile tea has several additional benefits.[16][17]\n\nHair thinning and hair loss can be combated with chamomile tea.\nDandruff and itchy scalp may be helped because of the anti-irritant and anti-microbial abilities.\nChamomile has long been known as a calming agent. Not only will you get a fuller, healthier head of hair, but you'll also likely mellow some.\nEczema, a skin condition that causes very itchy skin, may be treated in some regard by chamomile.",
                "Pour the tea slowly through clean, damp hair. Wring out the extra water from your hair before applying the tea to allow the chamomile to better permeate the strands. Let the tea sit for a few minutes.\n\n\nApplying the chamomile after the beer rinse will help disguise any remaining scent from the beer.\nWith repeated use, chamomile tea can lighten your hair, adding highlights or making blonde hair appear more vibrant.\nBe patient. Seeing results when using chamomile tea may take a few weeks in order to really be effective.[18]",
                "Rinse out the tea with cool water. Dry and style your hair as usual."

        "wikiHow to Train a Naughty Labrador": {
            "intro": "Labrador retrievers are incredibly cute dogs. Their roly-poly bellies, happy smiles, and wagging tails just capture our hearts. However, these dogs do need some training. Labradors are high-energy animals, especially since their breed was developed to work, hunt, and run all day.[1] Fortunately, Labradors are friendly and trainable.",
            "steps": [
                "Note that there is no such thing as a 'naughty' Labrador. The concept of 'naughtiness' is a human characterization that has been incorrectly applied to an animal. Your Labrador is not innately \"naughty\" or \"bad.\" Rather, your dog does what Labradors do in a Labrador fashion until you teach him new behaviors. Keep in mind that he wasn't born automatically knowing the rules of living in a human world.[2]",
                "Read up on the breed. Labradors are generally intelligent, happy, and energetic dogs. They need substantial attention and an outlet for their energy.\n\n\nLabradors originated from and were developed in Newfoundland. They were frequently used by fishermen to help retrieve fishing nets and loose fish. To this day, they remain good \"workers\" and swimmers.\nThe versatility of the Labrador has seen the breed utilized in many \"jobs,\" including search and rescue, police work, drug detection, and service work for the blind, among others.[3]",
                "Treat Labradors in a manner that befits their breed. Giving them what they need will help ensure that they don't engage in \"bad behaviors\" as a way to cope with the insufficiency of their treatment.\n\n\nFor example, Labradors need to play and be thoroughly walked.[4] If you don't do this, they often become bored and destructive. Keep them active by playing fetch and going on substantial walks at least twice a day. Increased physical activity helps a dog stay healthy and also tires them out. A tired out Labrador will, in turn, be less inclined to help himself to the food in your cupboards and dig up your garden. Swimming is also excellent exercise for a dog and playing fetch in the water is a great combination that expends a lot of dog energy.",
                "Be precise and direct. Don't lecture your Labrador. Your commands need to be simple and consistent. \"No\", \"Drop\", \"Wait\" are strong, simple, and direct. \"Stop doing that, oh for goodness sake\" or \"Oi, stop eating my shoe\" will not work as they are too complicated. Remember that dogs don't process language like humans do.",
                "Be firm and in control. In general, shouting at any dog is ineffective. This is especially true for Labradors who are an excitable breed by nature. Use a firm voice when instructing your dog; don't yell or lose control. Dogs are very intuitive and will be able to sense your frustration and may react in kind.\n\n\nFirm and assertive commands will communicate to the Labrador what you want him to do.",
                "Be timely in your responses and commands. Admonishing a Labrador too long after the incident is ineffective. If you need to admonish or correct your dog, it needs to be done during or within a few seconds of the act. Dogs will have forgotten the event within seconds of its occurrence, so it's key to address the behavior immediately in order to facilitate the retraining process.",
                "Coach the family. If you live in a household of more than one, your family also needs training. Explain to your family as well as visitors to your home about what your dog is and is not allowed to do. For example, if you do not allow anyone to feed your Labrador at the dinner table, then you need to let others know about that rule. If other family members or visitors don't know about this rule, they may feed your dog, which is confusing for him and will disrupt the training you have done.",
                "Never beat your dog. Beating or hitting Labradors when they behave in an undesirable manner will not help them become better trained dogs. Rather, they will become fearful of you, which will ultimately defeat the training process.[5]",
                "Reward the behavior you wish to encourage. It is easy to apply human morality and motivation to your Labrador. But the fact of the matter is that your Labrador is not human and 'just is' and 'just does'. For example, eating the sleeve of your best work shirt is not a conscious act on behalf of your dog to upset you. Oftentimes, the shirt was just there and it was chewable.[6]\n\nRewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior. Instead of becoming exasperated with and angry at your Labrador for chewing your shirt, encourage him to chew his play toy and reward him with praise for doing so.",
                "Try clicker training. Click training enables the immediate delivery of positive reinforcement. Labradors are highly trainable because they are so food motivated, which makes clicker training ideal for them.[7]\n\nClicker training uses a sound—a click—to tell the dog when he has done something right. The clicker itself is a tiny plastic box held in the palm of your hand, with a metal tongue that you push quickly to make the sound. The method works by teaching the dog that every time he hears the clicking sound, he gets a treat. Eventually the dog will come to learn that clicks are always followed by treats, which is a very powerful incentive for Labradors. One your dog makes this connection, you can use the click to mark the instant the Labrador performs the right behavior, such as sitting down. Over time, he will learn that sitting down when told gets him rewards.[8] Learn how to clicker train your dog.",
                "Appeal to your Labrador's belly. Most dogs are perpetually hungry. Labradors in particular are food-oriented and motivated. Reward desirable behavior with food and you’re likely to get a repeat of that good behavior.[9]\n\nFor example, if your Labrador is gnawing through your settee, encourage him to pick up his play toy and then reward him with a treat and make a great fuss of him. The treats can gradually give way to praise and over time, your Labrador will learn not to eat your settee.\nTreats should be small, such as Mini Zukes, Charlie Bears, Bil Jac, or freeze dried liver. Cooked kidney is a cheap alternative to buying dog treats and is also very easy to prepare and cut up. Many dogs will even work for their regular dog kibble.\nGiving treats as a reward for the behavior you wish to encourage should be used only as a starting measure. Treats should soon be replaced with praise as the reward, otherwise the dog may become overweight or even obese.\nSome trainers recommend having a dog with attention problems have to earn every kibble in his bowl, instead of being fed large meals at one time. That way, your dog is very focused on you and the food, making it easier to convey the message that he needs to “learn to earn.”[10]",
                "Employ distraction techniques. For instance, if your Labrador has taken to either launching himself at passers by or other dogs or barking at people and other dogs, then you should try to distract him. You need to temporarily interrupt your Labrador's stream of thought by talking to or commanding him or by an action (such as stomping your foot).\n\n\nAnticipate and work on distraction techniques with treats in low distraction settings and at home. Make sure you follow through with praise and treats. As you get more confident where it is quiet, increase the level of difficulty by walking around the block or near a dog park to work on his skills. Gradually work up to busier areas once your Labrador is consistently responding to commands like “leave it” or “watch me”. Work up slowly to added distraction and you will both gain confidence in your Labrador's ability to handle a crowd.",
                "Consult a professional trainer. A professional dog trainer, such as one from the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT), is very knowledgeable about dogs and can help you learn basic handling skills.[11]\n\nYou may need to start with a few private lessons to learn the basics before you and your Lab join a group lesson.\nThough it is an added expense, having professional assistance is beneficial in the long run because it will help you and your energetic dog communicate effectively.\nYou may even consider consulting a veterinary behaviorist. These are veterinarians who have additional training and expertise in animal behavior. Your veterinarian can refer you to one of these specialists from the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB).[12]",
                "Enjoy your Labrador. They are wonderful dogs. Be fair, consistent, and clear. They'll reward you in turn with love and affection!"

            "intro": "Musty, stinky, odorous old leather bags aren't much fun and it's probable you're not keen to reuse such a bag. Before you resort to throwing it out, there are various ways that might just restore it to a respectable odor again.",
            "steps": [
                "Try a simple clean first. If this clean doesn't shift the odor, you can try one of the other suggested methods after.\n\n\nWipe the leather bag inside and out with a clean, dry, soft cloth. This will pick up dust, loose debris and even some mold or mildew.\nWipe the leather bag down with a damp cloth. This will collect even more of the above items.",
                "Allow to air. Choose somewhere outdoors that is sheltered from direct light and heat, such as a table on the porch. Leave for a day if possible.",
                "Check the odor. If the bag still smells bad, choose one of the remaining suggested methods, or a combination of the methods.",
                "Prepare a solution consisting of equal parts of white vinegar and distilled water. Sponge the bag with the solution. Work on the inside of the bag and any mildewed outside part of the bag for a few minutes.\n\n\nIt's a good idea to test a small spot before trying this method, in case it stains.",
                "Wipe off the vinegar solution with a clean, damp cloth.",
                "Allow to air dry. Place the bag outside under shelter away from direct light to air dry.",
                "Check the odor. If it is still there, repeat. If not, the bag can be used again.",
                "Use liquid detergent soap to clean the bag.",
                "Make a solution of soapy water, using the liquid detergent. Dip the cleaning cloth or sponge in the solution and wring out before using.",
                "Wipe the cloth over and inside the bag. Concentrate in particular on the areas that you think are the smelliest.",
                "Allow to air dry. Place outside in a sheltered area away from direct sunlight and heat.",
                "Once dry, check for the odor. If it lingers, try again.",
                "Use baking soda to deodorize the bag.",
                "Fill a clean sock with baking soda. Tie off with a knot.",
                "Place the leather bag and the baking soda-filled sock inside a large resealable plastic bag. Alternatively, place both items inside an airtight container.",
                "Set aside. Let the baking soda work on the bag for at least 24 hours. The odors from the bag should transfer across to the baking soda.",
                "Remove from the resealable bag or container. Check the odor of the leather bag; if it still smells bad, repeat the process for another 24 hours, or longer. If it smells good again, throw away the baking soda, wash the sock and use the leather bag again.",
                "Find some newspaper. Scrunch the pages up and stuff them inside a large plastic bag, such as a kitchen waste bag or a garbage bag.",
                "Slide the smelly leather bag in with the newspapers. Arrange it so that it sits snugly in the middle of the papers.",
                "Tie the bag up with a knot. Alternatively, seal with a twist tie.",
                "Let sit for at least 48 hours. A few days more won't hurt it.",
                "Remove from the bag. Do a sniff test to see whether the odor has gone. If not, return to the bag for a few more days. Eventually it should start to smell better.",
                "Fill a sock with coffee grounds. They must be dry grounds, so if you're using grounds from your own coffee making, allow them to fully dry first. Or use the cheap instant coffee granules. Knot it off to keep the coffee intact.",
                "Place the coffee sock inside your old leather bag. Leave it there for up to a week. During this time, it should soak up much, if not all, of the cigarette smoke odor.",
                "Do a smell test. If all is good, the bag is ready for reuse. If it still smells a little, return the sock for a few more days.",
                "Make or purchase some potpourri. Place the potpourri inside a sachet.",
                "Place the sachet inside the smelly bag. Leave it there for at least one week.",
                "Place the bag in an airy place. Do not leave it in a dark cupboard; instead find somewhere with fresh air and indirect, cool light.",
                "Check a week later. It's a good idea to leave the sachet in the bag when using as well, as the scent will continue to improve the bag's own scent."

        "wikiHow to Identify if a Child Has Been Traumatized by an Event": {
            "intro": "Children who have experienced an initial traumatic event before they turn 11 years of age are three times more likely to develop psychological symptoms than children who experience their first trauma as a teenager or as an adult later on.",
            "steps": [
                "Be aware of what can be considered a traumatic experience for a child. A traumatic experience is one that terrifies or shocks the child and may have felt life-threatening (whether real or perceived) and caused the child to feel extremely vulnerable. Potentially traumatizing events include...[1]\n\nNatural disasters\nVehicle accidents and other accidents\nNeglect\nVerbal, physical, emotional, or sexual abuse\nRape\nWar\nViolent bullying or victimization\n\nCompliance therapy,[2] restraint, and seclusion[3]",
                "Recognize that different people respond to trauma differently. If two children go through the same experience, they may have different symptoms or different severity of trauma. What is traumatizing to one child may simply be upsetting to another.",
                "Consider signs of trauma in parents and other loved ones close to the child. A parent suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can also be a trigger for a child to develop a traumatized response. A child may even react more strongly to trauma because adults around them have done so, especially parents because they're so attuned to them.[4]",
                "Watch for personality shifts. Compare how the child acts now to how the child acted before the trauma. If you see extreme behavior, or a noticeable change from their normal behavior, then something is probably wrong.\n\n\nA child may seem to develop a new personality (e.g. a confident girl turning into a shaky people-pleaser overnight), or may switch between several strong moods (e.g. a boy who flip flops between withdrawn and aggressive).",
                "Consider how easily the child becomes upset. A traumatized child may cry and whine over relatively small things that wouldn't have bothered them so much before.",
                "Watch for regression. The child may revert to younger behavior, such as thumb-sucking and wetting the bed. This is especially common in cases of sexual abuse and compliance therapies for autism, but can be seen in other forms of trauma as well.",
                "Notice signs of passivity and compliance. Traumatized children, especially those harmed by an adult, may attempt to appease adults or avoid angering them. You may notice avoidance of attention, complete compliance, and/or overachieving to turn into a \"perfect\" child.",
                "Look for anger and aggression. Traumatized children may act out, become frustrated easily, and start throwing more temper tantrums. They may even become aggressive towards others.",
                "Observe symptoms of illness, such as headaches, vomiting or fever. These symptoms may worsen when the child must do something related to the trauma (e.g. going to school after abuse at school), or when the child is stressed.",
                "Look for any of the following psychological signs in a child. A traumatized child may exhibit any or all of these behaviors after a disaster:",
                "Watch for clinging to people or objects. The child may feel lost without a person they trust, or a favorite object like a toy, blanket, or stuffed animal. A traumatized child may become extremely upset if this person or object is not with them, because they feel unsafe.",
                "Notice nighttime fears. They may be afraid to sleep alone at night, with the light off, to sleep in their own room, or have nightmares, night terrors or bad dreams.",
                "Notice if the child keeps asking if the event will reoccur.\n\n\nSome children may obsess over preventing the event in the future, such as constantly checking the smoke alarm after a house fire. This may turn into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.",
                "Consider how much the child trusts adults. After all, their adults were not able to control the disaster, so they reason \"who can?\" and decide that nobody can keep them safe. Children abused by an adult may be afraid of other adults, especially adults who look similar (e.g. a small girl hurt by a tall, blond man may be afraid of her uncle because he is tall and blond).",
                "See if the child is afraid of certain places. For example, a child abused by a therapist may scream and cry if they see the therapy building, and may panic if they even hear the word \"therapy.\" Some children may be able to tolerate it with help from a loved one or security object, but be unable to bear being left there alone.",
                "Watch for guilt or shame. The child may blame themselves for the traumatic event because of something they did, said, or thought.\n\n\nFears are not always rational. The child may blame themselves for a situation in which they did nothing wrong, and could not have made things any better.\nThis may lead to obsessive-compulsive behavior. For example, maybe a boy and his sister were playing in the dirt when the traumatic event happened, and now he feels the need to keep everyone perfectly clean and away from dirt.",
                "Notice how the child interacts with other children. A traumatized child may feel alienated, and may be uncertain how to interact normally with others, or not interested.",
                "Pay attention if the child becomes startled more easily or afraid of sounds that didn't scare them before. A child may become afraid of wind, rain or sudden loud noises;",
                "Notice fears that they report. The child may talk about worries that their family will not be safe, or will not have anywhere to live. A traumatized child may obsess over their family's safety and try to protect their family.",
                "Watch for thoughts of self-harm or suicide. A suicidal child may start talking a lot about death.",
                "A psychologist or psychiatrist might see signs of anxiety, depression or fearlessness in the child.",
                "Be aware that even if a child does not display any or a few of these symptoms, that doesn't mean they're coping. A child can be impacted by a traumatic event but keep it bottled up inside out of a misguided need to be strong for mom or courageous for dad, etc.",
                "Assume that a child who has been part of a traumatic event needs to be cared for with extra attention to helping them through the event.",
                "Some children may not give evidence for being upset for several weeks or even months. Avoid rushing a child to explore and express their feelings. It can take time for some children to process what has happened.",
                "Seek help as soon as possible. The responses, reactions and abilities of those immediately responsible for a child influence the child's ability to cope with a traumatic occurrence.",
                "While you can and should talk to your child about their feelings and make it clear that you're available to talk at any time, it can be much more helpful to have professional help assist you.",
                "The types of therapy likely to assist recovery for your child include psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).",
                "Don't try to cope alone. While it is only natural for you to want to try to be the support for your child, going it alone will make it harder on you, especially if you have also experienced the traumatic event.",
                "Encourage your child's interaction with others. Family members, friends, therapists, teachers, and others can all support your child and your family in coping with the aftermath of the traumatic event. You are not alone, and neither is your child.",
                "Support your child's health. You can help a great deal by seeking to restore a routine as soon as possible, continuing to feed your child a nutritious diet and helping your child maintain play and exercise schedules that ensure connections with others of their own age and body movement for good health.",
                "Be available for your children and try to stay focused about what matters in the now in their presence, rather than ruminating on the past event."

        "How to Ripen Mangoes": {
            "intro": "Originally grown in South Asia, mangoes are versatile fruit that are now raised in tropical zones, such as South America, Mexico and the Caribbean. You can eat mangoes on their own, or can include them in salsas, salads, smoothies or a variety of other dishes. Mangoes are rich in fiber, potassium, beta-carotene, and vitamins A and C. The enzymes in the fruit may act as digestive aids. Mangoes come in shades of green, red or yellow. Although some people eat unripe mangoes, which are tart in flavour, the fruit is sweeter when ripened. Use these tips to ripen mangoes.",
            "steps": [
                "Ripen the mango in a paper bag or newspaper. Leave the bag of mangos on the kitchen counter overnight and check for ripeness in the morning. Mangos wrapped in a paper bag will release ethylene, which is an odourless gas that speeds up the ripening process.[1] Remove and use the mango when it gives off a fruity scent and yields to soft pressure, usually about a day (or less).\n\n\nAlternatively, you could try ripening the mangoes by covering them with onions and hay in a warm place; this method of ripening was used for ages in India.\nWhen wrapping mangos in a paper bag or newspaper, be sure not to close the bag completely. Some air and gas needs to escape or mold and mildew might start to form.[2]\n\nAdd an apple or banana to the bag to speed up the ripening even more. Adding more ethylene-emitting fruits will increase the ethylene in the bag, giving you an even juicier mango all the quicker.",
                "Submerge the mango in a bowl of uncooked rice or popcorn kernels. This old wives trick hails from India, where industrious moms hid unripe mangos in bags of uncooked rice to speed up the ripening. In Mexico, the trick is much the same, except with uncooked popcorn kernels instead of rice. The ingredients are different, but the process and the results are the same: Instead of waiting three days for your mangos to ripen au naturel, they should be ripe within a day or two, maybe even less.\n\n\nThe reason behind the ripening here is the same as the paper bag method: Rice or popcorn helps trap ethylene gas around the mango, resulting in a much faster ripening process.\nIn fact, this method is so effective that you sometimes risk overripening the mango. Check every 6 or 12 hours for doneness. As long as you don't forget the mango inside the bowl of rice, you should have a wonderfully ripe mango at your disposal.",
                "Set the unripe mango on the kitchen counter at room temperature. You only need time and patience for this method. Mangos, like other fruits, may take several days to ripen, but this is the most natural way of getting your mango plump, juicy, and ready to eat. Use the mango when it is soft to the touch and has a strong fruity smell.",
                "Smell the mango for the most reliable results. Sniff the stem end of the mango. If it has a heavy, fruity, almost musky odour, it is ripe. It you're struggling to find an aroma, chances are your mango isn't quite there yet.",
                "Squeeze the mango gently after you've sniffed. Press the mango gently. If it is soft and gives slightly, it is ripe. A ripe mango feels similar to a ripe peach or ripe avocado. If the mango feels firm and unyielding, it is still unripe.",
                "Don't rely on colour to judge the ripeness of a mango. Although most ripe mangos will also feature rich reds and burnt yellows more than soft greens, ripe mangos are not always red and yellow.[3] So forget the look of mangos when determining ripeness. Instead, use smell and softness as your guide.",
                "Don't be scared away by a few black spots on the surface of the mango skin. Some people are scared away by mangos that have a few splotchy, black blemishes on them. These blemishes usually indicate the beginning of the end for mangos. While mangos are notoriously susceptible to spoilage, black blotches don't necessarily mean the mango is bad. In fact, it may mean the mango has more sugar content.[4]\n\nIf the black spots are especially soft, cut the mango open and look for translucent fruit. This is a sign of spoilage, and these mangos should be thrown away.\nUse your senses if the mango in question has a few black spots: If it doesn't give too much, has a pleasant smell, and the skin is otherwise taut and richly-coloured, give the mango a go.",
                "Place the whole mango in the refrigerator when it has ripened. No wrap or container is necessary to store the mango in the refrigerator. Keeping the mango in the refrigerator will slow down the speed at which the mango continues to ripen. Keep a whole ripe mango in the refrigerator for as long as five days.\n\n\nNever store a mango in the refrigerator before it has ripened. Like all tropical fruits, mangos should not be stored in the fridge before they are ripe, as their fruit might be damaged by the cold temperature and the refrigeration will halt the ripening process.",
                "Peel and chop the ripe mango if desired. Place the chopped, ripe mango into an airtight container. Keep the container in the refrigerator for a few days. Keep chopped mango in an airtight container in the freezer for as long as 6 months."

        "wikiHow to Avoid Re Tearing an ACL": {
            "intro": "The ACL is a ligament in the knee joint that connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone). It helps to stabilize the knee, by preventing it from moving inwards or outwards. Unfortunately, once you have torn the ACL once, you much more likely to tear it again. However, you can take steps to prevent this from happening by doing exercises to strengthen the knee and the surrounding muscles, and by taking certain preventative measures.",
            "steps": [
                "Do squats to strengthen the knee and hip joints. Squats are a very effective exercise for avoid ACL re injury, as they strengthen the gluteal and gracilis muscles that help in supporting of the hip joints and the knee joints. To do a squat:\n\n\nStand about one foot away from a wall, then lean back until your back is touching it.\nSlide down the wall, bending your knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Don't allow your knees to extend beyond your toes.\nHold this position for 10 to 15 seconds, then return to the starting position and repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.",
                "Try one-legged bridges to strengthen the muscles that support the knee joint. This exercise helps to strengthen the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and rectus femoralis — a group of muscles that support the knee joint. To do one-legged bridges:\n\n\nLie on your back on the ground, facing a wall. Bend one knee, but extend the other leg so your foot is against the wall.\nUse your bent leg for support as you lift your hips and straight leg off the floor, so your body forms a diagonal line from your foot to your shoulders.\nHold this position for 10 to 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat the exercise 10 to 12 times.",
                "Perform forward lunges to strengthen the thigh and support the knee joint. This forward lunge exercise helps to support the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius and gracilis — muscles which support the thighs and knee joints To do a forward lunge:\n\n\nStand up straight with your feet one shoulder-width apart. Take a large step forward with one foot and bend your knees until the front knee forms a 90 degree angle and the back knee is almost touching the floor. Make sure the knee of the front foot doesn't extend beyond the toes.\nNext, take a large step forward with the back foot and repeat the exercise, this time with the opposite leg in front. Keep performing the lunges, in a walking motion, until you have completed 10 to 15 steps. This counts as 1 set. Repeat for 2 to 3 sets.",
                "Do jumps to practice control. Performing small, controlled jumps allows you to practice landing properly, putting minimum stress on the knees. This landing technique can then be applied when you return to sporting activities. To do the jumps:\n\n\nStand with your feet one shoulder width apart and take a small jump forward. Try to land on both feet simultaneously, as this helps to distribute your weight and avoids putting more stress on one knee than the other.\nIt is very important to bend your knees as you land, as this absorbs the shock of the jump and avoids stressing the knee joints and the ACL. Try to maintain proper body alignment, with the hips placed over the knees and the knees placed over the ankles.[1]\n\nRepeat this exercise 10 to 15 times, for 2 to 3 sets. Once your knees have become stronger, you can increase the intensity of this exercise by jumping off a low box (up to 12 inches in height) instead.",
                "Do balance exercises to regain knee stability. Performing balance exercises helps the injured knee to regain stability while also strengthening the gluteal and gracilis muscles that support the thigh and knees.[2]\n\nStand on your injured leg on a stable surface with the slightly bent and your body properly aligned (knee over ankle, hip over knee). Try to hold the one-legged stance for 10 to 30 seconds, before relaxing. Repeat 8 to 12 times on each leg.\nAs your balance improves, you can make the exercise more difficult by closing your eyes as you do it, lifting the opposite knee up and down, standing on an unstable surface, or throwing a ball back and forth with a partner.",
                "Use a resistance band. Resistance bands help to strengthen the knee joint and the surrounding muscles, by making them work harder to perform a simple action. Resistance bands can be used in a multitude of exercises, to increase their difficulty level. Here are a few simple exercises you can do:\n\n\nSit on a chair with your back straight and place a resistance band around your ankles. Raise your injured leg until the band is stretched and you feel resistance in your quadriceps. Repeat 10 times.\nLie on the floor on your stomach and place one end of the resistance band around the ankle of your injured leg and the other around a sturdy object (like the leg of a table). Bend your leg at the knee, bringing your heel towards your butt, until the band is stretched and you feel resistance in your hamstrings. Repeat 10 times.[3]",
                "Wear a knee brace to support and protect the knee. Wearing a knee brace following an ACL tear can help you to avoid re-injury. The brace is made from lightweight materials that support the knee and protect the ligaments inside the joint.\n\n\nThere are different types of knee braces depending on the type of physical activity you intend to pursue — lightweight ones for people who just want to go for a daily walk, or more heavy duty ones for athletes returning to sport.[4]",
                "Always warm up properly before exercise. It is essential to warm up properly before doing any form of exercise, as this warms the muscles, joints and ligaments and prepares them for physical activity. This significantly reduces the chance of injury.\n\n\nYou can warm up by doing 5 to 10 minutes of dynamic stretching, such as jumping jacks, straight leg kicks or running on the spot.",
                "Don't push yourself too hard. Pushing yourself too far too soon is one surefire way to re-tear your ACL. It is essential that you go through the entire rehabilitation process following an injury to regain full strength and mobility in your knee joint, and that you delay returning to your regular exercise or sports routine until your physical therapist gives you the okay.\n\n\nWhen performing the rehabilitation exercises, it is essential that you stop or decrease the intensity of the exercise once you start to feel any pain. These exercises should challenge the muscles, ligaments and joints, but they shouldn't be painful.",
                "Recognize the symptoms of a re-torn ACL. If you have already experienced an ACL injury, you are probably familiar with the symptoms of a torn ACL. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms early on so you can seek treatment and begin the path to recovery. Symptoms of a torn ACL include:\n\n\nA popping or cracking sound at the time of the injury.\nPain that ranges from moderate to severe, depending on the extent of the injury.\nSwelling and inflammation around the knee joint, accompanied by tenderness, redness and a feeling of warmth.\nInability to move or extend the knee, or knee instability.[5]",
                "Use the RICE method to heal a torn ACL. Immediately following an ACL injury or tear the RICE method must be used to prevent the injury from becoming any worse and begin the healing process. The RICE method works as follows:\n\n\nRest: The knee must be rested for at least the first 72 hours following the injury. Avoid doing any form of physical activity.\nIce: Apply an ice pack or cold compress to the injured knee for 10 to 20 minutes intervals. This reduces swelling and inflammation.\nCompression: Wear an elasticated knee brace around the injured knee to support the joint, prevent unnecessary movement and prevent swelling.\nElevation: The knee must be elevated above heart level using cushions and pillows to prevent and reduce swelling.[6]",
                "Take medication to relieve any pain. Following an ACL tear, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to relieve pain and bring down swelling. The most commonly prescribed NSAIDS include ibuprofen and Voltaren.\n\n\nIf you have a history of gastrointestinal upsets, gastric or peptic ulcers, renal or hepatic diseases, or you are currently taking any blood thinners such as Warfarin, you need to be very cautious about taking NSAIDS, so speak to your doctor first.",
                "Undergo surgery following severe tears. For most people, following the RICE protocol and and completing a thorough rehabilitation program will be enough to restore full mobility and strength to the knee. However, in the case of severe injuries, surgery may be required to repair the torn ACL. This surgery is particularly common amongst athletes.\n\n\nThe surgery is normally performed several weeks following the injury to allow time for the swelling and inflammation to go down.",
                "Follow a rehabilitation program to regain knee mobility and strength. Regardless of whether you have undergone surgery or not, a thorough rehabilitation program (usually lasting for up to 6 months) will be necessary to return your knee to full strength and mobility. [7]For more detailed information on how to rehabilitate your knee following an ACL injury, see this article."

                "Position your fingers over the milk reservoirs on your breast. You should position your hands in a \"C\" above or below your nipple. Here's what you should do:\n\n\nPut your thumb above your nipple. It should rest approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) above your nipple.\nPlace the first 2 fingers of your hand 1 inch (2.54 cm) below your nipple directly in line with your thumb.\nAdjust your finger placement for comfort and your breast size.\nRefrain from cupping your breast in this position.",
                "Apply pressure inward toward your chest wall. The pressure should be gentle and firm, but should not feel like you are squeezing the breast at all. Avoid tightening or stretching your skin over the areola, because this will make it more difficult to express the milk. Press your thumb and index finger directly back into the breast tissue, into the wall of the chest. Here are some other things to keep in mind:\n\n\nRemember to press back, not out, and to roll your fingers, not slide them.\nRoll your thumb and fingers forward so that you squeeze the milk out of the milk sinuses, which are found under the areola, under the nipple.\nKeep fingers together. Spreading your fingers out reduces the effectiveness of the process.\nLift larger breasts before applying pressure.",
                "Express breast milk. Use a rolling motion away from your body with your thumb and fingers. Compress your breast with this rolling motion. As the saying goes, you should press, compress, and then relax. Once you get used to it, you should be able to fall into a rhythm, as if the baby were nursing, which will help you express your breast milk more easily.\n\n\nEvery woman's breasts are different. It's up to you to find the best position that helps you express the most milk.\nYou can also experiment with expressing your breast milk, massaging, expressing your milk, and massaging again.",
                "Collect the expressed breast milk in a container. If you're expressing just to make your breasts feel more comfortable, you can express the milk into a towel or just express it over a sink. Here are some things that you can do if you do want to save the milk for later use:\n\n\nUtilize milk bags to collect the expressed milk.\nExpress the milk directly into bottles for later use.\nUse a funnel to direct the breast milk into your chosen container, if necessary.\nUse a container with a wider mouth, such as a coffee cup or a small jar. Once the cup is filled, transfer the milk into a storage container.",
                "Repeat the process on the other breast. Change positions slightly on each breast to completely express all milk. Moving back and forth between the breasts will stimulate even more expression of milk."
