            "intro": "Stomach acid helps digest food, activate enzymes, and destroy germs that make it to your stomach.[1] However, stomach acid can also cause “heartburn,” that burning or uncomfortable feeling in your chest.[2] Chronic heartburn, also known as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) or “acid reflux disease,” isn’t due to “too much” acid, but acid in the wrong place (your esophagus instead of your stomach).[3][4] Excessive production of stomach acid can cause erosions in the stomach and the duodenum (part of your small intestine), called ulcers or \"Peptic Ulcer Disease.\"[5][6] This article will help you handle your stomach acid problems, whether they’re due to stomach acid being where it shouldn’t be or the overproduction of stomach acid. If you continue to experience problems, see your doctor.",
            "steps": [
                "Recognize the symptoms of acid reflux. “Acid reflux” is what causes the burning pain or discomfort in your chest or throat called “heartburn” (which doesn’t have anything to do with your heart). If you have other symptoms, you may have a more serious condition, like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux disease.Here are some symptoms to look for:[7]\n\nPain that worsens when you lie down or bend over[8]\n\nRegurgitation of food into your mouth (be careful of aspirating or inhaling gastric contents)\nAcid taste in the mouth\nHoarseness or a sore throat\nLaryngitis\nChronic dry cough, especially at night\nAsthma\nFeeling like there’s a “lump” in your throat\nIncrease in saliva\nBad breath\nEaraches",
                "Understand the risk factors for GERD. Acid reflux occurs when the valve at the entrance to your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) doesn’t close properly, allowing stomach acid back up into your esophagus. This causes the burning known as “heartburn.” If this happens more than twice a week, you have acid reflux disease, also known as GERD. Below are some common risk factors for acid reflux disease:[9]\n\nEating large meals\nLying down right after a meal\nBeing overweight or obese\nBending over after eating\nBedtime snacking\nEating trigger foods, like citrus or chocolate\nDrinking certain beverages, like alcohol or coffee\nSmoking\nPregnancy\nTaking NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.)\nHiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the stomach bulges up into the chest area through an opening in your diaphragm. It will need to be surgically treated.[10]",
                "Recognize the symptoms of ulcers. Most ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection called Helicobacter pylori.[11] The most common sign of an ulcer is a dull or burning pain in your belly. The pain may come and go, but may appear strongest at night or between meals.[12] Other symptoms of ulcers include:[13]\n\nBloating\nBurping or feeling like you need to burp\nLack of appetite\nNausea or vomiting\nWeight loss",
                "Know when to seek immediate medical attention. In addition to the above symptoms, ulcers can cause internal bleeding in the stomach and intestines, which can be extremely dangerous. If you see any of the following symptoms, get medical treatment immediately:[14]\n\nDark red, bloody, or black stool\nDifficulty breathing\nDizziness or fainting\nFeeling tired for no reason\nPaleness\nVomit that looks like coffee grounds or contains blood\nSharp, severe stomach pain",
                "See your doctor. If you have frequent or persistent heartburn, you should see your doctor. If you have GERD and don’t seek treatment, it can cause serious medical conditions, including esophagitis (an inflammation of the esophagus lining),[15] esophageal bleeding or ulcers,[16] the pre-cancerous Barrett’s esophagus,[17][18] and increased risk of esophageal cancer.[19]\n\nIf you have ulcers, these require medical treatment. They can cause other conditions, including internal bleeding, stomach perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction (where the passageway from the stomach to the small intestine is blocked).[20]\n\nIn some cases, ulcers from Helicobacter pylori can cause stomach cancer.\nSome medications, such as Fosamax ( an osteoporosis drug), steroids, and immunosuppressants, can cause excessive acid production. If you are taking these medications, do not stop taking them until you have consulted with your doctor.",
                "Ask your doctor to check for Helicobacter pylori. Since the 1980s, doctors have discovered that the type of bacteria called H. pylori causes most stomach ulcers. About ⅔ of the world’s population carries H. pylori, but for most people it doesn’t cause any symptoms.[21] Between 30-67% of people in the United States are estimated to carry H. pylori.[22] In developing countries, that figure can be as high as 90%.[23]\n\nYou can get H. pylori from food, water, or eating utensils. You may also contract it through contact with saliva, fecal matter, or other body fluids of infected people.[24]\n\nBecause the sanitation conditions in developing countries are often different than those in the US and other countries, you may contract H. pylori if you travel to another country, especially if you drink the water or eat undercooked food. Poor hygiene and poor sanitation, while preparing and cooking food, are also common ways to get H. pylori.\nIf you have H. pylori, you should have your whole family or any people you live with tested as well. Reinfection can occur unless the infection is eradicated in everyone with whom you live in close contact.[25]\n\nYour doctor can use noninvasive techniques to test for 'H. pylori, such as urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen tests.",
                "Ask a pharmacist to recommend an antacid. If you can’t get to the doctor immediately and want some relief from acid reflux symptoms, ask your pharmacist. S/he can recommend an effective (but temporary) over-the-counter antacid. A pharmacist can also help advise you to choose an antacid that won’t interact with your other medications. Common choices include:[26]\n\nZantac, 150 mg once per day\nPepcid, 20 mg twice per day\nLansoprazole, 30 mg once per day\nAntacid tablets, 1-2 tablets every 4 hours",
                "Talk with your doctor about stopping NSAID use. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause ulcers.[27] NSAIDs reduce inflammation by blocking certain enzymes in your body. One of these enzymes also produces a chemical that protects your stomach lining from stomach acid. Using NSAIDs reduces this protective chemical, which can lead to ulcers.[28]\n\nCommon NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), ketoprofen (Orudis KT), and nabumetone (Relafen).[29] They also come in prescription strengths.\nWhen using over-the-counter NSAIDs, do not use them for more than three days for fever or 10 days for pain relief. If you need long-term pain relief, talk with your doctor about other options.[30]\n\nNSAIDs are more likely to cause ulcer complications when you use them long-term (1-4% of users will develop ulcers). The risk increases the longer you use them.[31]\n\nThe elderly and people with H. pylori co-infection are also at a higher risk of developing life-threatening ulcer complications when using NSAIDs.[32]",
                "Reduce your stress. In the past, it was commonly believed that stress caused ulcers. Doctors no longer believe this is true; most ulcers are caused by H. pylori infections. However, stress can make ulcers worse.[33] It may also increase stomach acid secretion in some people.[34][35]\n\nSet aside time to relax. Take a pampering bubble bath. Go shopping just for fun. Take up a new hobby. Making time for leisure activities can help you destress.[36]\n\nTry yoga or tai chi. Yoga and tai chi are forms of exercise that focus on deep breathing and meditation. They have both been found to relieve stress in clinical studies.[37][38][39][40]\n\nGet some exercise. Physical exercise can decrease feelings of stress and anxiety. Aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity every week.[41]\n\nGet social support. Often we feel stressed when we’re facing a lot of pressure and don’t feel supported. Talk with family or friends, join a support group, go to church — whatever makes you feel like you’re part of a supportive community.\nSee a mental health professional. Some people believe that you need to have “huge” issues to see a therapist, but this simply isn’t true. If you’re feeling stressed or anxious, seeing a counselor or therapist could help you discover why and learn ways to deal with your feelings.[42]",
                "Stop smoking.[43] Smoking is bad for your health, full stop. While smoking hasn’t been shown to increase stomach acid production, it can cause acid-related discomfort and physical damage in several ways.[44]\n\nSmoking increases your risk of GERD by weakening the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the muscle at the entrance of the stomach that keeps acid from flowing back into the esophagus. Smokers have a much higher risk of frequent and chronic heartburn.[45]\n\nSmoking weakens your immune system and increases your risk of H. pylori infection, which increases your likelihood of developing stomach ulcers. Smoking also slows the healing of ulcers and makes them more likely to reoccur.[46]\n\nSmoking increases pepsin, an enzyme produced by your stomach that may harm your stomach lining in excessive amounts. It also decreases factors that help heal your stomach lining, including blood flow and mucus production.[47]",
                "Maintain a healthy weight. Carrying excess weight in your abdominal area puts pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, forcing your stomach contents and stomach acid into the esophagus and causing heartburn.[48] This is also why heartburn is a common side effect of pregnancy. If you have a BMI greater than 29, losing weight may help reduce your heartburn.[49]\n\nBefore starting any weight loss regimen, consult with your physician.\nIf you are severely overweight (BMI equal to or greater than 40), bariatric surgery may be an option to help you reduce your weight and improve acid reflux symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether this surgery is right for you.[50][51]",
                "Drink lots of water. Staying hydrated by drinking enough water each day can help keep stomach acid in your stomach, where it belongs.[52]\n\nYou may want to look into “alkaline water,” which may help reduce stomach acidity. Because you need some acidity to help you digest properly, talk with your doctor before trying alkaline water.[53]",
                "Monitor your alcohol consumption. If you have problems with stomach acid, you may need to reduce or even stop drinking alcohol. The biggest culprits are beverages with a low ethanol concentration (<5%), such as beer and wine.[54] Fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, champagne, sherry, etc.) are considered powerful stimulators of stomach acid production.[55] No direct link has been discovered between alcohol and stomach ulcers, but people who have ulcers are also more likely to have cirrhosis of the liver, a condition often caused by heavy alcohol consumption.[56]\n\nAlcoholic beverages produced by distillation, such as whiskey and gin, do not appear to stimulate stomach acid production.[57][58]\n\nNo matter what you choose to drink, drink only in moderation. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that you consume no more than four alcoholic drinks per day and no more than 14 per week if you are male. If you are female, consume no more than three alcoholic drinks per day and no more than 7 per week.[59]\n\nA “standard” drink is any of the following: 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8-9 ounces of malt liquor or high-gravity beer (7% ABV), 5 ounces of regular wine (12% ABV), 3-4 ounces of fortified wine (17% ABV), 2-3 ounces of cordial or liqueur (24% ABV), 1.5 ounces of brandy or 80-proof spirits (40% ABV).[60]",
                "Watch your caffeine intake. Caffeine appears to stimulate acid secretion in the stomach.[61] Coffee, in particular, may cause heartburn because of caffeine and other substances coffee contains.[62]\n\nEven uncaffeinated beverages, such as tea, can cause heartburn. For example, mint herbs such as peppermint or spearmint can provoke heartburn.[63]\n\nIf you can’t live without your coffee, choose an espresso, French roast, or other dark roast coffee. Not only do they contain less caffeine, they also contain the compound N-methylpyridine, which may actually block your stomach’s production of stomach acid.[64]",
                "Avoid eating before bedtime or lying down. Eating within two to three hours of lying down or going to sleep can cause heartburn. It takes roughly two hours for your stomach to empty its contents into your intestines. Stay upright for two to three hours after eating to avoid heartburn.[65]\n\nIf your heartburn is worse at night, try elevating the head of your bed by four to six inches, or use a wedge-shaped pillow to help you sleep in a semi-elevated position.[66]",
                "Eat smaller meals. Eating large meals can put undue pressure on your stomach, which can cause acid reflux symptoms. Eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid putting pressure on your stomach.[67]\n\nWearing loose clothing can also help you avoid putting excess pressure on your stomach.[68]",
                "Avoid high-fat foods. High-fat foods tend to decrease the pressure in your lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which could mean that stomach acid backs up through it into the esophagus. Go for lower fat foods and incorporate plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains into your diet.\n\n\nHigh-fat foods may also increase the amount of time it takes for your stomach to empty its contents into the intestines, putting you at increased risk of acid reflux symptoms.[69][70]\n\nChocolate not only contains a lot of fat, it also contains methylxanthine, which has been shown to relax your LES and cause heartburn in some people.[71]",
                "Avoid spicy foods. Spicy foods, such as peppers, raw onions, and garlic, can cause your LES to relax, allowing stomach acids back up into the esophagus. If you suffer from frequent acid reflux symptoms, avoid spicy foods.[72]",
                "Avoid high-acid fruits. Citrus fruits and tomatoes (yes, tomatoes are fruits!) are high in acid, which can worsen your heartburn symptoms.[73] If you have frequent acid reflux symptoms, skipping these fruits may help.\n\n\nOranges, grapefruits, and orange juice are common triggers of heartburn symptoms.[74]\n\nTomato juice and tomatoes are also highly acidic and may trigger heartburn.\nPineapple juice is highly acidic and may cause heartburn.[75]",
                "Drink a glass of milk. The calcium in milk can act as a temporary buffer for stomach acid. However, because it’s also a high-fat food, it may trigger your stomach to produce more acid, in the long run, so choose a low-fat version.[76]\n\nTry drinking goat’s milk or skim cow’s milk. Both of these options are very low in fat.[77]",
                "Chew gum. Chewing gum stimulates your body’s production of saliva, which acts as a natural acid buffer. Chewing gum when you feel heartburn coming on may help.[78]\n\nAvoid mint gums. Mint, especially peppermint and spearmint, may actually trigger heartburn.[79]",
                "Try licorice. Several studies have shown licorice root (the herb, not the sweet candy) to be effective in helping your esophageal lining resist irritation from stomach acid.[80]\n\nMake sure you look for de glycyrrhizin ted (DGL) licorice. The active ingredient glycyrrhizin can cause serious side effects.[81]\n\nWhen using licorice to treat acid reflux, take 250-500mg three times daily. Chew the root either one hour before or two hours after meals.[82]\n\nYou can also make a licorice tea by infusing 1-5 grams of dried licorice root in 8 ounces of water. Drink this tea three times daily.[83]\n\nYou should not take licorice if you have any of the following conditions: heart failure or heart disease, hormone-sensitive cancers, fluid retention, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney or liver disease, low potassium, or erectile dysfunction. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take licorice.",
                "Try ginger. Ginger has been used to treat indigestion in traditional Chinese medicine.[84] No scientific evidence has found ginger to be effective at treating symptoms of acid reflux, but ginger does also have other health benefits, such as treating nausea and upset stomach.[85]\n\nTake ginger supplements in capsule form or take ginger with meals. Eating raw ginger on its own may actually cause mild heartburn.",
                "Try cranberry. Preliminary research suggests that cranberry may inhibit the growth of the bacteria H. pylori in your stomach.[86] While it isn’t known for sure whether cranberry helps prevent ulcers related to H. pylori, it is generally safe to consume and provides other health benefits, including keeping your urinary tract healthy.[87]\n\nTry drinking 3 ounces of pure cranberry juice (not “cocktail” or a juice blend) per day.[88]\n\nYou can also eat 1.5 ounces of fresh or frozen cranberries.\nCranberries have high levels of oxalate, which is related to the formation of kidney stones. If you’re at high risk for kidney stones, talk to a doctor about whether cranberry is right for you.",
                "Try baking soda. Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a natural antacid that may help neutralize stomach acid that has found its way back into your esophagus. Your pancreas naturally produces sodium bicarbonate to help neutralize excess stomach acid.[89]\n\nAlka-Seltzer is the brand name of a common over-the-counter version of sodium bicarbonate.\nTake one half-teaspoon, dissolved in water, every two hours for heartburn.[90]\n\nIf you are on a low-sodium diet, don’t use sodium bicarbonate as it does contain sodium.[91]"

        "How to Clean Teak Furniture": {
            "intro": "Teak furniture is made out of a kind of wood that is naturally more resistant to fading and damage from the outdoors than other types of wood. For this reason, a lot of outdoor furniture is often made out of teak wood. Even though it is quite resilient, teak furniture must still be properly cared for in order to help it last longer. Generally a quick scrubbing with soap and water is enough to clean your teak furniture. But, over time, you may need to consider staining or applying oils to protect your teak furniture.",
            "steps": [
                "Start from the bottom. When cleaning your teak furniture, you should always start at the bottom and keep cleaning as you move up to the top of the furniture. This will help you avoid any streaks or irregularities caused by the cleaning solution or the cleaning process.[1]\n\nStarting at the top may be tempting, as it is the most visible part of your teak furniture. But beginning here could damage your furniture, or make it become more unsightly.",
                "Wipe down with soap and water. The best way to keep your teak furniture clean and looking great is to give it a quick wipe down with soap and water once every few weeks. This kind of maintenance will prevent discoloration and the buildup of grime and mildew. Simply apply some mild liquid soap to a sponge and wipe down the surface.[2]\n\nYou can also add a bit of bleach or vinegar to the soap to get it extra clean.",
                "Rinse thoroughly. Be sure to rinse the soap off thoroughly to avoid leaving any soap residue, as this could cause more buildup of grime over time. If you are cleaning your teak furniture outside, use a garden hose to rinse off the soap.\n\n\nIf you are cleaning the teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to remove the soap residue. Be sure to frequently rinse the cloth out so that you don’t keep reapplying the soapy water.\nLet the teak furniture air dry when you finish rinsing it off.",
                "Store cushions separately. The oil in the teak wood often leaks out, especially in the first few months after application, and can stain fabrics that it comes in contact with. If you have cushions on your teak furniture, you should consider storing them separately from the teak furniture itself. This will help your teak furniture look nicer for a longer period of time.[3]\n\nThis is especially important when it’s raining, and right after you’ve oiled the teak wood.",
                "Avoid pressure washing. Pressure washing can be a great way to clean lots of surfaces, but your teak furniture shouldn’t be one of them. It may seem like a simple solution, but it can wear down the surface of the teak wood over time and cause more damage. If cracks develop in the wood, shooting water into the cracks at high velocities will cause the wood to become deformed over time.[4]\n\nPressure washing can also remove any finish that might be protecting the teak wood, causing more damage in the long run.",
                "Make a bleach cleaning solution. Mix together 1  c (240 mL) of chlorine bleach, 1  c (240 mL) of laundry detergent, and 1 US gal (3.8 L) of warm water. This mixture will create a cleaning solution that is strong enough to remove most dirt and stains, but gentle enough to keep from damaging your teak furniture.[5]\n\nAs always when handling bleach, be careful not to get it on any other materials.",
                "Apply the bleach with a brush. Use a soft plastic brush to apply the bleach solution and gently scrub it into the teak wood. Let the solution sit for approximately 15 minutes and then rinse it off completely with water.\n\n\nMake sure to do this cleaning outdoors. If you must do it inside, use a drop cloth on the floor to avoid spilling any bleach around your home and damaging something.",
                "Use a brush to scrub. Instead of power washing away all of the dirt (along with all of the protective elements), use a handheld scrubbing brush to get a controlled clean for your teak furniture. Gently scrub away any stains or imperfections in the wood. But don’t scrub too hard or you might damage the wood permanently.[6]\n\nGetting the teak wood wet first can help the scrubbing process be more effective. And a constant flow of water will help rinse away any dirt or grime as you clean.",
                "Use store-bought teak cleaner. This cleaning method is more aggressive in fighting stains and signs of wear. So it may be better suited for teak furniture that has been left outdoors for long periods of time. Simply apply the teak cleaning solution to the furniture and scrub it in with a soft brush. Generally, you should let it remain on the teak for 15 minutes or so before you rinse it off with the hose.[7]\n\nFollow the directions for application on the bottle.\nLook for the active ingredient oxalic acid in any store-bought teak cleaner.",
                "Rinse off the cleaning solution. Whether you use store-bought teak cleaner or a bleach cleaning solution, you’ll need to rinse off any remaining residue after you finish cleaning. Use a garden hose to rinse the teak off completely and let it air dry.\n\n\nIf you are cleaning your teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to wipe off any remaining cleaner residue.",
                "Oil the teak wood. Purchase some Tung or Linseed oil at your local home improvement store and apply it to the furniture. Use a paintbrush to make even strokes across the entire surface of the teak wood furniture. You can use a damp cloth the wipe up any excess oil as you continue painting. Continue painting until the wood seems saturated and doesn’t soak up any more of the oil.[8]\n\nBe sure to thoroughly clean the teak furniture before you apply any oil.",
                "Apply a synthetic-resin sealer. This kind of stain or sealant will help protect your teak furniture from the elements and prevent damage in the future. Purchase some sealer from your local home improvement store and apply it using a paint brush. Let the stain dry completely before using the furniture again – this usually takes about 24 hours.[9]\n\nBe sure to get a sealer or stain that is approved for use on teak wood.",
                "Re-stain the wood once every few years. As with any wood product, teak furniture will need to be re-stained once every 2-3 years. The stain loses its effectiveness over time and needs to be replaced. Once you start noticing more cracks in the teak wood, you’ll need to start thinking about staining it again to seal up those cracks and protect the wood.[10]\n\nThis step isn’t necessary if you’ve opted to keep up the natural, unstained appearance of the teak wood. However, unstained teak requires more regular cleaning.",
                "Store the furniture out of direct sunlight. Nothing will make teak age and weather faster than constant, direct contact with sunlight. This will cause your teak furniture to look older and to need more maintenance as time goes on. Try to put your teak furniture in a place that gets a lot of shade, at least during part of the day.[11]\n\nConsider storing your outdoor teak furniture in a shed completely away from the sunlight during the winter months when you aren’t using it as much."

        "wikiHow to Use a Vanilla Bean": {
            "intro": "Purchasing a vanilla bean is the ultimate cooking luxury. Mexican, Tahitian, and Madagascar Bourbon beans are soft, shiny, and oily, with a rich flavor that infuses any baking or cooking. You can use the seeds in the vanilla bean pod in baking or as natural flavoring in your food.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Split the pod if you want to use the seeds. If you are planning to use the vanilla bean in a batter for a cake or for a batch of cookies, you will need to open the vanilla bean pod and remove the seeds. You will then add the seeds to the batter to infuse it with a natural vanilla flavor.[2]\n\nTo split the pod, lay the vanilla bean pod on top of a clean, dry cutting board. Turn the hooked end of the vanilla bean to the top of the board. Hold the top of the vanilla bean with your non-dominant hand and a sharp paring knife with your dominant hand.\nSplit the pod with a long, vertical stroke through the middle of the bean. Cut only into the center of the pod, not through it completely. You want access to the tiny, dense seeds in the middle. Go slowly. If the knife slips in your hand against the bean, realign your knife with your previous cut and continue cutting the bean.",
                "Scrape out the seeds. Peel the two sides of the vanilla bean outward with the side of the blade. Don’t use the sharp end, since you don’t want to cut the vanilla bean further.[3]\n\nUse the side of the knife or a small spoon to dig out the seeds. Dig the seeds out of the pod by running the spoon or the knife down the inside of one side of the pod.\nYou should open the vanilla bean right before you plan to use them in cooking or baking. Keep in mind one vanilla bean is equal to three teaspoons vanilla extract. If you only need half that amount, you would only cut halfway down the bean, exposing only half of the seeds.\nA table of conversions for vanilla bean can be found online.[4]",
                "Add the seeds to a baking recipe. If you have a recipe for a cake, cookies, or a pie that require vanilla extract, you can use the vanilla seeds instead. Add the vanilla when you cream the butter in the recipe as this will ensure the seeds are well incorporated into the batter.\n\n\nYou can also ensure the seeds are evenly distributed in your batter by taking a small amount of the batter and using a spoon or your hands to smush the seeds into the batter. Then, fold the batter with the seeds into the rest of the batter.[5]\n\nA list of cakes, cookies, and pies that use vanilla bean can be found online.[6]",
                "Create a vanilla infused sugar. You can also rub the vanilla seeds into white sugar, infusing the sugar with vanilla. Rubbing the vanilla into the sugar will release the aroma of the vanilla and infuse the sugar with a natural vanilla taste. The sugar can then be used when sugar is required in a recipe.[7]\n\nUse the vanilla infused sugar in cookies like vanilla bean sables or vanilla shortbread.",
                "Make your own vanilla extract for baking. Rather than spend a lot of money on vanilla extract at the store, make your own by saving the split vanilla pods and using them to make vanilla extract at home. This is a time based process, so if you know you are going to need vanilla extract for baking you make the extract at least one to two months ahead of time.[8]\n\nPlace three to four split vanilla pods lengthwise in a clean, glass container. Add a pint of high quality vodka, rum, or bourbon to the container and seal the container. Let the container sit in a cool, dark place for one month if you are using rum and three to four months if you are using vodka. Shake the jar periodically to move around the flavors in the container. The richness of the extract will depend on how long you let the pods soak in the alcohol.\nUse Grade B vanilla beans to make vanilla extract. You can use Grade A beans as well but they will be more expensive.[9]",
                "Add a vanilla pod to a quart of milk. If you would like to use a vanilla bean in baking recipes that contain milk, you can add the vanilla pod to a quart of milk and heat up the milk in a saucepan over medium high heat. You can also use the vanilla pod in puddings, custards, and other milk based recipes.[10]\n\nAnother option is to throw the vanilla bean seeds and the split vanilla bean pods into the pot of milk for an extra kick of vanilla. You may want to try the milk after a few minutes of boiling to ensure the vanilla flavor is present in the milk but not overpowering.",
                "Place a vanilla bean in your sugar bowl. Give your sugar a vanilla flavor by adding split vanilla beans or whole vanilla beans to your sugar bowl or sugar shaker. The vanilla bean will give off a natural flavor and infuse the sugar so you have vanilla flavored sugar. You can then use the sugar in your morning coffee or in baked goods.[11]",
                "Put dried vanilla in your coffee beans. If you’d like to infuse your coffee with a natural vanilla flavor, you can place dried vanilla in your bag of coffee beans. You can use vanilla seeds or vanilla pods, laying them in your coffee beans overnight or for several weeks. Over time, the coffee beans will become infused with the vanilla.",
                "Wrap the bean in foil and store it in a cool, dark place. Vanilla beans are susceptible to air and can dry out if they are left unwrapped. To prevent the vanilla bean from becoming brittle, you should wrap the bean in tin foil and seal it in a zip-lock bag. You can then store it in a cool, dark spot in your kitchen.[12]\n\nDo not store vanilla bean in your refrigerator or your freezer, as these spots are too cold for the bean and can in fact dry it out. Instead, look for a spot in a low cupboard to store the bean.\nVanilla beans that are stored properly will last for several weeks.[13]",
                "Plump up dried out beans with boiling water. If your vanilla bean starts to dry out or appear brittle, you can revive it by immersing it in a pot of boiling water for several minutes. This should help to plump up the beans and bring it back to it’s original shape and texture.[14]",
                "Use fresh vanilla beans within two to three weeks. If you are planning to use fresh vanilla bean seeds for baking or cooking, you should aim to use up the vanilla beans within two to three weeks. After this time, the beans will start to dry out, even if they are stored properly in a cool, dark place.[15]"

            "intro": "Do you always need to talk? Maybe you've noticed that people get annoyed with you when you are talking, or seem to lose interest in what you're saying. If you want to adjust your talkative ways, make sure to think before you speak, and recognize that silence can be okay. Avoid making the conversation all about you, by learning how to actively listen and ask questions. Seek support from friends and family for guidance, and learn how to adapt your talkative behavior to each social situation that you're in.",
            "steps": [
                "Evaluate the causes for your talkativeness. You may love to talk about yourself, and not even realize that it's bothering people. You may have a nervous need to fill silence because it feels awkward for you. You may feel the need to talk because you're jittery and feel like you've got to let out what you want to say.[1]\n\nBe aware of what may be the causes for your talkativeness.\nAssess if there are certain situations or people that cause you to be more talkative. Maybe you’re excited about something or someone? Or maybe you’re nervous?\nWhen you look at the situations where you’re more talkative, you can begin to control your behavior better.\nTry keeping a journal for a few weeks to help identify patterns of behavior and potential triggers.",
                "Notice if people seem to get annoyed or zone-out when you talk. Do you notice yourself talking and talking and talking? Maybe you end up apologizing for your behavior after the fact. Think about the instances when your talkativeness is getting in the way of others. For a while, you will need to prompt yourself to be aware of these things every time you go into a conversation. Over time, this will become something you notice naturally. Be aware that you should stop talking (or at least move on to a different topic) when:[2]\n\nthe person is not paying attention or talking to someone else.\nthe person seems bored or uninterested.\nthe person is distracted, such as looking at their phone, tablet, or computer.\nthe person is working.\nyou're talking too fast, and they can't seem to focus on what you're saying.",
                "Avoid making the conversation all about you. While talking about yourself may be fun and interesting for you, that’s not always the case for other people. Avoid relating every situation back to you and your life. Find ways to connect what you’re talking about to the other person in the conversation.[3]\n\nA conversation is a two-way street. Learn to slow down and give space for other people to talk.\nThink about a recent time that you were too talkative. What was the topic about? Did the situation seem to only focus on you and your interests?\nBe more interested in what others say and do. You may come off as selfish or self-centered if most of your conversations are dominated by you and your interests. The best way to do this is to ask questions!",
                "Think before you speak. You may feel like you need to say whatever comes to mind. Take a step back and process what you want to say. Don’t rush to get your words out before you realize what you’re saying. This is particularly true in public or group settings.\n\n\nSometime when you speak first, and think later, you realize you said too much or said something that shouldn’t have been said.\nGive yourself time to process your thoughts. It shows maturity and patience.\nIf you find yourself offending or irritating people with what you say, or your constant chattering, remember to listen to your brain and think about your words. Don’t let your restless energy take over and speak for you.",
                "Accept that moments of silence are okay. Silence can be a beautiful thing. It can help to clear our mind and quiet our thoughts. It doesn’t have to be awkward or uncomfortable all the time. Give yourself a break and let the uncomfortable silence turn to patience.[4]\n\nMindless chatter to fill silence may make you feel more at ease, but it could be irritating to others. Don’t feel like you need to fill dead space. Those moments might simply be a sign to stop talking or to move on to a topic that interests everyone, not just you. Have a few polite ways prepared to exit a conversation when it comes to its natural end.\nMany people are fine with moments of silence, particularly as they age. See moments of silence as ways to process thoughts and feelings more clearly. If you are constantly talking, you’re not able to truly listen to what you’re feeling in that moment.",
                "Ask questions and show interest in others. Instead of making the conversation about you, stop and ask questions to show your interest in what others have to say. To avoid being too talkative, it’s important to learn effective listening skills. A conversation isn’t just about you; it’s about all the people involved. [5]\n\nIf you’re talking about your day, or something that you do, ask the other person about their day or what they’ve been doing. Give them a few minutes to speak.\nKeep engaged in what they’re saying. It’s rude to turn your attention, such as to other people or your phone. If the roles were reversed, you’d probably be irritated if they weren’t paying attention.\nAsk questions about them. Get to know them better. Consider saying things about their family, interests, hobbies, favorite movies, sports, music, or other topics that can help you to know the person. See if you can remember one thing you learned about them that you can refer to next time you talk to them. This will keep you from talking about yourself and let them know you were interested in what they shared.",
                "Encourage others to talk rather than filling up the conversation. Let’s say you’re the more talkative person in a group. You might want to talk more if others are quiet. Instead of filling the dead air with your words, encourage others to speak.\n\n\nUnderstand that some people can be shy, or feel less of a need to talk. And that’s okay.\nMake them feel accepted, and show an interest in what they have to say. Say things like, “What do you think about this?” or “I’d love to hear what you think.”\nIf you’re in a group where people don’t know one another, or feel comfortable yet with each other, it may take more effort to get others engaged, but this can be ultimately rewarding.\nThe more that you keep others interested and engaged by learning about them, the more likely they won’t see your talkativeness as annoying.",
                "Listen instead of interrupting others. Being interrupted when talking is a common reason why people feel irritated by other talkative people. Allow the other people time to speak, and to say what they want to say. Sometimes, they may talk slower than you. Patience is a key part of good listening skills. [6]\n\nWait three to five seconds after a person stops talking before you jump into the conversation. This is to make sure that they have finished what they wanted to say.\nIf you have a thought or opinion that comes to mind when someone else is talking, avoid interrupting them when they are mid-sentence. Briefly apologize if you catch yourself doing this. Let them know this is something you're working on. Find spaces or breaks in what they are saying before you add your comment.",
                "Learn to rephrase or \"echo\" what they've said. One important part of good listening skills is demonstrating that you were not only paying attention to what someone was saying, but that you understood what they were say. By rephrasing or “echoing” what someone said, you are asking for clarification, more information, or a deeper understanding.[7]\n\nThis rephrasing or repeating back what someone said shows that you are truly listening, and want to focus on the person. For example, if someone is talking about being anxious when planning to visit some relatives for the holidays, you could say, \"So it sounds like you're worried about what it will be like when you see your relatives?\"\nIt allows the opportunity for great understanding if there is miscommunication or confusion about what was stated. This can help when you’re not sure what someone said or why they said it.",
                "Find support from trusted friends and family about your talkativeness. Be open to listening to what others have to say about your talkativeness. They may have some helpful insight about ways to stop being so talkative. Ask them to prompt you if they catch you interrupting people or talking too much. Having people hold you accountable will help you reach your goal faster.\n\n\nConsider asking a trusted friend or family member if they have faced the same challenges as you with being overly talkative. They may be able to explain what has helped them, or what they’ve been through.\nListen to their suggestions about ways to change your habits.",
                "Be willing to adapt your communication style. While it may seem hard at first to change the way you talk or interact with others, it’s important that you find ways to communicate that adapt and change to fit your audience.\n\n\nKnow your audience. Is it a large group? Just one person? Someone who’s quiet or someone else who’s really talkative? Is it a classroom setting? At work? Or just hanging out with friends?\nEach situation may merit a change in your way of communicating. Be attuned to what others are saying or doing. If everyone else is quiet, then think about ways to be quiet. If it’s a social gathering, find ways to engage others in the conversation.",
                "Understand the various causes of excessive talkativeness. Some talkativeness comes from personality differences, such as being very extroverted. Other times it could be a symptom of a medical or mental health condition. Most commonly, being overly talkative is a nervous or stress-related habit that can be controlled.\n\n\nWatch out for any concerns that your excessive talkativeness may be pressured, rapid, and seemingly uncontrollable. Maybe it feels like you can't stop, and the pace of speech seems inappropriately urgent. If this is your situation, talk with a mental health or medical professional for an evaluation. There may be medication or therapy that can help. [8]\n\nEvaluate if you constantly crave to be with others, or get your energy from talking with other people. You may be strongly extroverted, and thus might come off as bothersome to others if you are constantly restless and want to talk with people.\nBe aware that sometimes anxiety and stress can lead to heightened or rapid talking. Find ways to notice what you're doing, and refocus your mind on how to stay calm, focused, and relaxed in that moment. Practicing mindfulness techniques and meditation may help.",
                "Get feedback from a counselor if your talkativeness is hurting your work or social life. If you feel like people are treating you differently, or making you feel unwelcome due to your talkative behavior, consider talking with a counselor about how to cope.[9]\n\nFind a counselor at your school, through an Employee Assistance Program, or in the community. Ask them about how to help with communication skills.\nDiscuss how to establish boundaries of communication, and how to respect others’ communication styles. A counselor can give you an unbiased and non-judgmental opinion on the situation."

        "How to Earn His or Her Trust Back": {
            "intro": "Successful relationships aren't free of hardship. If you have betrayed your partner's trust, you may be able to salvage the relationship by earning trust back. Show your partner you are committed and want to mend the relationship. With time and attention, you can gradually reestablish trust.",
            "steps": [
                "Take responsibility for your behavior and admit what you did. Lying will only further erode trust and create more stress for you. If you are dishonest, you will continue to worry about being caught. Be honest and forthright to prevent potential future betrayal and delay the process of regaining trust.[1]\n\nBeing forthcoming will also allow you to explain your behavior in the best possible way. Your partner may assume the worst and others may exaggerate what happened, so take control of your story.",
                "Put yourself in his or her shoes to avoid becoming defensive. Your partner will likely be upset and may use negative language. Even if you know you did something wrong, this may cause you to become defensive of deflect blame. It is important to remember your partner is in great pain, and he or she needs to express that.[2] When you start to feel the urge to defend yourself, imagine how you would feel if your partner betrayed your trust. This will help you to recognize your partner's communication as an expression of pain, rather than an attack.\n\n\nNothing you do will ever justify abuse. If your partner becomes physically aggressive, verbally abusive, or threatens you in any way, you should leave the situation immediately and seek help.[3]",
                "Actively listen to your partner. Show your partner you care about his or her thoughts and feelings by restating and reflecting what he or she communicates to you. Restate his or her communication by paraphrasing. Then, reflect by stating the emotion he or she is expressing.[4]\n\nFor example, your partner says, \"You said you'd be there, but you weren't. You knew how important this was to me!\"\nRestate by paraphrasing \"I wasn't there, even though I promised I would be.\"\nReflect by acknowledging the emotion your partner is communicating, \"I disappointed you.\"",
                "Validate his or her feelings. It is very important your partner feel heard and understood. Your betrayal represents a disregard for your partner's well being. Demonstrate you care by describing how your behavior likely affected your partner.[5] For example, \"My behavior was hurtful and violated your trust.\"\n\n\nTry to avoid using the phrase \"I know,\" when talking about others' feelings. While not meant to offend, some people may interpret it as patronizing.",
                "Explain your motivation to behave the way you did. What drove you to betray your partner? You are responsible for your actions, but understanding the emotion underlying your behavior may trigger your partner's empathy and will help you avoid similar situations in the future.[6] Describe how you felt and then describe your behavior. For example, \"I felt insecure in our relationship and sought attention from others.\"\n\n\nUse \"I\" statements to avoid inadvertently making your partner feel like you are blaming him or her.",
                "Plan to behave differently in the future. It is key to help your partner see how you will avoid hurting him or her in the future. Identify what led to the behavior and ways you could have avoided the situation. For instance, if your behavior was influenced by a certain person, commit to avoiding being alone with him or her. This may involve making sure you have your partner or another friend accompany you to events the person is likely to attend and leaving if you find yourself alone with the person.\n\n\nCommunicating and resolving your issues with your partner should always be included in the plan.",
                "Be sincere. Express genuine regret and remorse for betraying your partner. Your partner is more likely to trust you if he or she believes you will act to avoid future unpleasant emotions as a result of your behavior.[7]\n\nAvoid making promises you can't or don't intend to keep. Failure to follow through on promises may make earlier apologies seem insincere.",
                "Communicate clearly with your partner. Poor communication likely contributed to the betrayal; one or both of you was not being open and honest. To ensure this is remedied, identify barriers to effective communication and ways to overcome them. This will show your partner you are committed to avoiding future betrayal.[8]\n\nIf you or your partner is uncomfortable discussing emotions, agree to write letters to each other about emotional subjects.\nIf you and your partner do not communicate frequently enough, schedule weekly dates to discuss your relationship.\nIf you are struggling to identify why you and your partner are not communicating effectively, consider enlisting the help of a couples counselor. A counselor will be able to help you identify and solve communication problems.",
                "Ask your partner what he or she needs. You may be at a loss as to how to earn your partner's trust again. Ask your partner what you can do to help them move toward trust. This may mean communicating more regularly, spending more time together, going to counseling, being patient, or something else. Ask your partner to guide your behavior in order to build trust.",
                "Call and/or text regularly. Contact throughout the day will demonstrate you are thinking about your partner. This will help ease concerns that you are acting without regard for him or her. Your partner is more likely to trust you if he or she feels connected to you.[9]\n\nA good way to maintain contact without being needy is to text funny photos or brief descriptions of funny interactions you have with others.",
                "Plan activities to spend time together, without focusing on the betrayal. Once you have apologized and made a plan to behave differently, try not to dwell on the hurtful event(s). Refocus attention on the present by engaging in fun activities together.[10] If you are spending more time with your partner, he or she will worry less about what you are doing when you are apart.\n\n\nFind a hobby you and your partner can enjoy together. This will increase the amount of time you spend together and can strengthen your bond.",
                "Express gratitude for your partner. Show him or her how much you appreciate him or her and how important the relationship is to you. When your partner feels valued, he or she will feel secure in the relationship.[11]\n\nTry leaving notes of appreciation in places you know he or she will see them.\nIf you demonstrate appreciation with gifts, be careful your partner doesn't feel like you are trying to buy your way out of trouble.\nHelp out around the house to show him or her you notice and appreciate how much he or she does.",
                "Accept that it will take time. Be patient with your partner while he or she learns to trust you again. This is out of your hands, and trying to speed the process along may cause your partner to feel you are not respecting his or her feelings.[12]\n\nInstead of focusing on something you have no control over (time), focus on the things you can control, such as being reliable and consistent.[13]\n\nShow your partner you have made long-term changes; don't just do things for the short term and then fall back into old habits.[14]"

        "How to Do Well in School": {
            "intro": "School is an important part of your life. It will help you to determine what you will be doing in the future and learning how to learn well sets you in a good position for lifelong capability. There are many ways to improve your grades so that you do really well at school. Whether you're a failing student desperate for a higher grade, or a less-than-perfect student struggling to get the last point, or simply wanting to shift from the easy mark zone into the higher marks, this simple guide will be helpful for you.",
            "steps": [
                "Have your necessary materials all the time. You don't want to be unprepared for sudden note-taking or a pop quiz by discovering you forgot your pencils/pens/erasers and if that happens you will waste time and might miss some important information.",
                "Be organized. Being organized helps you work better, relax and be ready to find and hand in stuff on time. There are plenty of ways to self-organize and it is best that you find the method that works best for you. The key is to be able to find what you need with ease, including the retrieval of information and your notes. Set up a system as soon as possible, including things like a good computer filing system, a good paper filing system, a desk-clearing policy (at least weekly) and a neat arrangement for your textbooks, writing books and associated reference manuals and books.\n\n\nMake use of highlighters, bright Post-It tags, and other items to label and highlight your organized items. Color coding works extremely well for lots of people, especially busy people and those who can't abide reading labels!",
                "Keep a calendar. Choose one that can fit in your folder or binder so that you can easily turn to it and find it when you need to use it. In this calendar, write down all your tests and assessments, and if your school has different academic classes on different days, write those down too. Also, make notes of study sessions or time you plan to spend doing homework. This keeps you aware of upcoming tests and other events, so you can study and prepare for them properly.",
                "Set long-term or short-term goals. Even if you don't know what you want to do when you grow up or what college you want to go to, your goal can be just to give yourself as many opportunities as possible.",
                "Keep your attendance up. Your attendance is important at school. If you don't go to school, your grades will obviously drop fast because you will have gaps in your learning that are difficult to back fill. If you have a genuine illness or other issue preventing you from attending school, have a parent, guardian or friend talk to your teachers about doing catch-up work from home.",
                "Write down notes. Notes will help solidify material in your head and will also serve as important study tools before a test. Be sure to write down everything important that the teacher goes over. If it helps, ask for a printout of the material beforehand so you can focus on taking notes on what the teacher is saying, not just copying down what is on the board. If the teachers write something on the board and they underline it chances are it's important or it will be on future tests.",
                "Make sure to answer / ask at least one question per class. This will show your teacher that you're actively participating in class. But more than that, it also forces you to pay enough attention to be able to ask/answer questions. As a result, you'll do much better on tests and quizzes. The ability to ask questions is a skill that you'll need throughout life, and ensures that you can keep a check on the motivations and ideas that you come across in various walks of life.\n\n\nWhen you pick a question to answer, make sure you know the answer and the questions are not too easy. Don't worry about asking too many questions; it's the teacher's job to help you.\nParticipation in class is often an important factor of your grade. Raising your hand once or twice in class doesn't do any harm, especially if you remember that \"there is no such thing as a stupid question\" when it comes to learning in class. Many times people will be wondering the same thing but lacked the courage to ask it!",
                "Listen actively. Don't just ask questions or talk. Learn to listen too. Eighty percent of the questions you find on any test were explained in class. The key to many understandings of the materials presented is often through listening to the teacher's explanations.",
                "Revise/study at home. Do this in a quiet place with no distractions. If the computer is in your room, take it out or go to another room. Don't study with the radio on! It might help you write more but on the day of the exam, the only thing you'll remember will be the lyrics.\n\n\nMake a schedule. Making a self-schedule could help you save time for self-study/revision as well as keeping you on track on what you're doing and what to do next.\nRewrite your notes. Yes, this may sound boring and time-consuming, but it's been proven to help you remember more of what you wrote down. It also helps you to figure out problems you might have had in the class.",
                "Put effort into your homework. Though it seems like a torture device, homework is a way of controlling and making progress outside of the classroom. This isn't very comforting the night you have two essays and algebra to do, though, so remember to do the actual homework and keep up with the workload. If you're having serious difficulties, talk to your teachers and parents to come up with a schedule for your homework.",
                "Take breaks now and then. Instead of multitasking, set aside a certain amount of time to do homework. When that set amount of time is over, take a 20-30 minute break to keep your mind from getting tired. When that time is up, go back to doing 100% homework.",
                "Start large assignments and projects early. If you have two weeks to do a project, rather than putting it off till the last three days before it's due, start working early. This way you can spend enough time planning, researching, and asking any questions you have about the project. The whole experience will be much less stressful since you won't have to rush through it. You'll also have plenty of time to make the project as good as it can be, which means that you'll get a better grade.",
                "Take a practice test before the exam to further your understanding of what you need to study. Be careful, though, taking dozens of practice tests is a much less effective way to study than combining one or two with other forms of study.",
                "Study during the holidays and vacation from school. If after the holidays you have a test and have not reviewed over the holiday period, your mind will have switched off and you will have forgotten a lot of things that you have learned before the holidays. Therefore you are likely to fail the test or do badly in it.\n\n\nGet a book at your grade level for any new class subject you will be taking next term such as chemistry, and read or scan it closely. Look at all the illustrations, charts, definitions, and learn things like the chemical symbols (C is carbon, H is Hydrogen, Zn is zinc, Au is gold, Ag is silver.). Read chapter summaries.\nTreat the holidays like any weekends: Yes, you can relax and have fun, but study at least 3 times a week so you don't forget everything you have learned.\nAsk your parents or friends to sit with you and review over what you have difficulty with, or that you need to memorize and recite.",
                "Study with friends. Reviewing with your friends during free time can help keep you focused.\n\n\nMake sure that you work with people who you can focus around. Any time you spend chatting instead of studying is wasted time as far as the study group is concerned.\nFor some people, working in a group may be hard to do because friends can distract you from your studies. Or, you may be someone who actually works better without other people around; do not view this as anything wrong, it is simply about your personal makeup––for example, you may be a deep thinker who needs time and space to digest issues fully. Be aware that this does not mean you're not capable of working in teams; quite the opposite, you are more likely to be a good team player if you understand the issues properly.",
                "Ask for clarifications when you don't understand things. Asking for help if you don't \"get\" what the question is asking is the only way you're going to find out what to do. Pretending you know and making it up as you go will only prolong the agony and can reduce your marks.",
                "Learn from your mistakes. Don't see mistakes as personal flaws; failures are a guidance in how to do better. Pay attention in class when something is being corrected. Mark your work clearly and carefully so that it is useful in preventing other errors in the future. You will learn a lot more if you use your mistakes and failures to guide you to the correct approaches and results.",
                "Meet with your teacher outside of class. If you do not understand a concept during class time, meeting with your teacher outside of class will help you understand it better and will also build a strong relationship with you and your teacher.",
                "Ask for help. Looking over guidebooks may help you in classes with which you are struggling. Alternatively, you could go to the teacher for extra help, have a friend coach you, or ask your parents to hire a tutor.\n\n\nNever be afraid to ask your tutor for help. They can help you with any subject, and there is no need to feel dumb or ashamed that you need help.",
                "Be persistent! Don't only start well and let it fall apart. Keep your study plans active and working for your success. Reward yourself when you do well.",
                "Relax. Don't freak out over tests. Start studying more than one day before the exam so that you have plenty of time to ask questions when you don't understand.",
                "Sleep well every night. Sleep will improve your memory and concentration skills, which in turn will lead to you doing better in school.",
                "Eat a healthy breakfast. Food is energy for your brain and having food in you before school starts can help you concentrate and focus. If you can't get breakfast for some reason, speak to your teacher about school programs or assistance for breakfast.",
                "Join extracurricular activities. This will allow you to make more friends, do something fun, and have something to add on a college or even job resume to show people that you are a well rounded-individual.\n\n\nFind something that you enjoy doing to balance out the work. But don't spend too much time on it that you don't get to your homework.",
                "Make sure you study and be determined to do well. There is no need for hours on end of studying, but see how much time you have until the exam and divide the amount into equal amounts of studying each day. Remember to balance it out. Go out with friends at the weekend and maybe on one weekday, but make sure you don't forget about the work."

        "How to Decrease Your Appetite": {
            "intro": "Appetite is both a psychological and physical phenomenon. Sometimes we eat when we are bored, stressed, or just because it is \"time\" to eat, even though we are not really hungry. There are many weight loss programs and diet pills marketed as appetite suppressants, but it is possible to decrease your appetite naturally through diet and exercise.",
            "steps": [
                "Get full with fiber. Fiber is a non-digestible complex carbohydrate that makes you feel full while consuming few calories. Fiber foods like oatmeal are excellent for diets because not only do they help you decrease your appetite they also provide sustained energy by regulating the release of insulin and blood sugar.[1]\n\nIt is recommended to eat 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 caloric intake or about 28 grams for a woman and 38 grams for men.\nIf your goal is fat loss, then include large amounts of vegetables, legumes, and fruits that are high in fiber.\nEat oatmeal for breakfast and you will survive until lunch without snacking. Oatmeal is slow-digesting and will keep you feeling full.",
                "Drink coffee. A couple cups of Joe in the morning may boost your metabolism and suppress your appetite.[2] However, for some people, coffee has the opposite effect. Learn how coffee affects your body and act accordingly.\n\n\nCoffee beans are packed full of caffeine and antioxidants that are easily absorbed by the body. It is estimated the impact begins within one hour after drinking a cup of coffee.",
                "Eat dark chocolate. Chocolate lovers rejoice. Get the dark chocolate bars that contain at least 70 percent cocoa because it has just enough bitterness to decrease your appetite.[3]\n\nCocoa contains stearic acid which has proven to slow down digestion and make you feel full for a longer period of time.\nMix your bitter dark chocolate with a cup of coffee to double the impact.",
                "Add more protein and fat. Protein needs energy from calories to digest, which promotes hormones that suppress hunger. Proteins and fat provide the most appetite suppression due to prolonged blood sugar regulation. A diet high in protein and healthy fats creates a blood sugar environment which is stable and controlled. This will also impact future appetite and cravings. Consuming fats in moderation, although lower in its thermic effect, has the ability to make you feel full during dieting.\n\n\nReplacing carbohydrates with lean protein by 15–30 percent, improved weight loss and reducing hunger.\nCasein protein, often found in protein powder supplements, is a slow-release protein that makes you feel fuller and, therefore, reduces appetite.\nDiets that are very low in fats have the opposite intended effect; they increase hunger. Fat is not bad for you in moderate doses and has many health benefits. It also makes your food taste better.",
                "Experiment with carbohydrates. Sugars and starches are an important source of energy for running your metabolism. Carbohydrates constructed from starch are full of nutrients and make you feel fuller.[4]\n\nComplex carbs are digested slowly, satisfying your hunger and reducing your appetite. You can find complex carbs in foods like brown rice, whole wheat bread, and quinoa.\nFiber can also be found in starch, which helps contribute to satiety.",
                "Hydrate with water. Water takes up space. Since the body is primarily composed of water, it craves water on a routine basis. Whether water is an appetite suppressant or not, it is a vital substance for the body and it contains zero calories.[5]\n\nThe eight glasses of water per day is no longer supported by most studies. Instead, take your weight and divide it in half. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, you should drink 100 ounces of water or 12.5 glasses per day.[6]\n\nAdd a drop or two of lemon or lime to your water to give it flavor.\nWater is a far better alternative to soda or alcohol, both of which will dehydrate you.\nIf you ever get hungry between meals and you already had a healthy snack, drink a glass of water to fill you up and quench your hunger.",
                "Eat breakfast every day. There is a reason why people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day: your body fasted all night and reduces hunger throughout the day. Reports show that skipping breakfast leads to more snack breaks in the afternoon.[7]\n\nNighttime eating syndrome (NES), a disorder associated with overnight eating and waking at night to eat, is clinically recognized as an eating disorder. Eating breakfast every day reduces the chance of experiencing this disorder.[8]\n\nStudies also show that skipping breakfast leads to weight gain, hypertension, insulin resistance, and elevated fasting lipid concentrations.\nSkipping meals has the same impact as skipping breakfast. Although people believe skipping a meal will help with weight loss, the exact opposite is true. It will lead to more snacking and greater weight gain.",
                "Snack on healthy foods. There's nothing wrong with an afternoon snack, just make sure it is a fruit, vegetable, or lean protein like chicken breast or fish. These healthy snacks will control hunger until dinner and they have added value: vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that is good for your body.[9]\n\nAvoid sugary products and drinks because they will not satisfy your hunger and you will most likely continue snacking throughout the day.\nIf you want fat, eat healthy fats that will decrease the consumption of sugars and avoid overeating in the late afternoon.",
                "Eat mindfully. Mindful eating techniques are used to prevent overeating. The way it works is to concentrate on every step of eating one piece of food, which makes you conscious of portion size and slows down the race to finish your meal.[10]\n\nThe purpose of mindful eating is to not engage in other activities like watching television or playing on the computer while you are eating. These distractions interfere with your ability to realize how much you are eating.\nAn example would be eating a raisin or other dried fruit that you can hold, feel its texture, see its color, smell, and taste it. As you eat the raisin, follow the same procedure as you swallow it. By eating the raisin, you have experienced the wide range of senses in a mindful manner, taking note of how meaningful the exercise is.\nTry to spend at least twenty minutes per meal to chew and swallow your food so that you chew and digest it completely.",
                "Match nutrition to your physiology. How many meals you eat on a daily basis depends on your fitness goals, lifestyle, and manageability. There are benefits for eating a few meals a day and for up to eight meals per day. The key is to find a nutrition system that optimizes your health.[11]\n\nEating more frequently, like six to eight meals per day, does not provide significant increase to your metabolism or to fat loss. For example, if you eat three meals a day at 1,000 kcals each and six meals at 500 kcals each, they both equal 3,000 kcals. In short, energy levels remain the same and, therefore, several meals a day does not provide additional benefits to controlling appetite.\nEat more frequently when you trying to add muscle and strength to your body or if you have diabetes. Eat less frequently when concentrating on fat loss or if you have a busy lifestyle.\nThe best approach is to eat when you are hungry and stop when you are satisfied.",
                "Exercise regularly. The impact of exercise is tricky. Engage in moderate-high intensity exercise and your body will suppress appetite because it will use your stored fat as an energy source while low intensity exercise, like walking, swimming, and jogging, will increase hunger.\n\n\nStudies have found that the neuronal response to food significantly decreased with moderate to high intensity workouts.\nExercise also reduces the incentive motivation in the brain responsible for the anticipation of food. This effect reduces hunger and keeps you healthy and reduces stress.",
                "Get some sleep. There are numerous studies on sleep and sleep deprivation and its impact on the body. In general, a lack of sleep has a negative impact on the body and increases hunger hormones that makes us crave for snacking throughout the day.[12]\n\nStudies show that bodies lacking sleep are bodies that crave more carbohydrates throughout the day. Scientists believe this is due to the body's natural craving for carbohydrates to increase energy levels.\nSleeping is intimately related to feeding. A lack of sleep for prolonged periods of time increases the intake of food dramatically.\nLeptin, a hormone released by fat cells that suppresses appetite, highly depends on the length of sleep. A lack of sleep, therefore, dramatically impacts the influence of hunger.",
                "Perform yoga. Yoga can reduce your appetite. The intimacy of performing yoga makes you more aware of your body and, therefore, more sensitivity to feeling satisfied and less likely to snack on junk food.[13]\n\nYoga performed at least one hour per week has shown to reduce appetite. Because yoga reduces stress, it suppresses a hormone called cortisol, which is associated with binge eating.\nMindful eating, the-step-by-step thought process to eating, is also a part of yoga. This process helps you to stop eating when you are full.",
                "Control emotional hunger. Eating because you’re bored is a learned habit, but distinguishing between true hunger and emotional hunger is difficult for many people.[14]\n\nReal physical hunger comes about gradually and can be easily satisfied with most foods. You will naturally stop eating when you are full and you will not feel guilty. Conversely, eating because of boredom causes cravings for particular foods, comes about quickly, and causes you to overeat. You will probably feel guilty after you are finished eating.\nWrite down the foods that you eat throughout the day in a journal. Keep track of your feelings before and after you eat. If you find you are eating unhealthy food frequently between meals or late at night and feel guilty consider doing a different activity during these time periods like taking a walk, reading a book, or playing with your pet.\nIf you find the urge too strong then concentrate on eating healthy snacks like fruit, vegetables, or nuts."

        "wikiHow to Plant Hostas": {
            "intro": "Hostas are a type of perennial plant with large leaves, full foliage, and small flowers. These plants will thrive in shady spots, but many varieties do require a certain amount of sun. Most gardeners buy established hosta plants from garden stores and nurseries when they want to add a new hosta to the garden, but you can also divide existing plants or grow new ones from seed.",
            "steps": [
                "Wait for the right time to plant hostas. Hostas aren't overly sensitive to cold, so you can plant them as soon as the ground is warm enough to work in the spring. Spring and late summer are the ideal times to plant hostas, because they are in active growth phases and will take root easily.\n\n\nIf you're going to plant hostas in late summer, do it at least six weeks before the first frost.[1]",
                "Choose a location with the right amount of shade. Hostas are shade-tolerant plants that require minimal amounts of sun – though they also won’t thrive in deep shade. The ideal location is somewhere protected from strong winds and hail, that’s shaded between the hours of noon and 4 p.m., and that receives some filtered sunlight.[2]\n\nYou can protect hostas from sun, wind, and hail by planting them under established trees. Make sure you don’t plant them too close to the roots, however, or the hostas will have to compete for nutrients.\nHosta’s shade tolerance depends on the type. As a rule, those with yellow leaves can survive more sunlight than hostas with green, blue, or white leaves. Blue hostas need the most protection from the sun.[3]\n\nHostas will also thrive near outer building corners that still get some mild sun exposure.",
                "Amend and till the soil. In the area where you want to plant the hostas, till the ground to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm) using a manual tiller, rototiller, or hoe.[4] Amend the soil with organic matter that will loosen the soil, discourage rodents, and acidify the soil slightly.\n\n\nGood organic matter for hostas includes aged manure or compost, peat moss, and leaf mulch.\nThe ideal pH for hostas is between 6 and 6.5.\nHostas don’t need a large space for planting. If you're planting individual hostas, the hole only needs to be as wide as the root system.",
                "Soak the plants. Sometimes hostas come from nurseries in bags with bare roots. It’s especially important to soak the roots if that’s the case with your hostas, because it will help prepare the plants for transplanting.[5]\n\nChoose a bucket or bowl that’s slightly smaller than the crown of the hosta.\nFill the bucket with cold water. Rest one hosta crown on the rim of the bucket so the roots are soaking in the water below. Repeat for each hosta.\nSoak the plants for at least an hour before transplanting. If you're not transplanting the hostas immediately, leave them soaking to keep the roots moist.",
                "Untangle the roots. Right before planting, remove the hostas from the buckets and use your hands to gently untangle the roots. Use your fingers to carefully comb the roots so there aren't any tangles, and ensure all the roots are facing the direction they're growing in.[6]\n\nHostas, especially potted ones, are susceptible to tangled roots. The plants can strangle themselves if you try to plant them in the ground with their roots tangled.",
                "Dig holes and plant the hostas. For each hosta, dig a hole in your prepared garden bed that’s about 2.5 feet (76 cm) wide and 1 foot (30 cm) deep. Place one hosta in each hole, making sure the roots don’t become bent or tangled. Fill the hole loosely with soil, but do not pack the soil around the roots. Make sure only the roots of the plant are buried, and that the entire crown is above the ground.[7]\n\nWater each plant thoroughly immediately after planting.\nLeave enough space between the hostas to accommodate for their mature width. This will depend on the variety of hosta you have. If you're not sure, leave about 3 feet (76 cm) of space between the hostas.",
                "Add a top layer of mulch. The mulch will help keep the soil moist, prevent weeds from growing, and protect the plants from rodents. After planting, add a 3-inch (7.6-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the garden bed around the hostas.\n\n\nIdeal mulch for hostas includes shredded bark, pine needles, or mulched leaves.[8]",
                "Provide the plants with consistent moisture. Soak the soil after you plant the hostas. Keep the soil evenly and consistently moist throughout the life of the plants. Hostas that are exposed to lots of sun need even more water to prevent burning.\n\n\nGive the hostas about an inch (2.5 cm) of water per week during active growing phases in spring and summer.[9]",
                "Prune dead leaves in fall. Hostas will enter a dormant state in fall and winter, meaning they won’t grow and won’t require as many nutrients. When fall arrives, prune the hostas by trimming off dead or yellow leaves.[10]\n\nDying leaves can still suck nutrients from a plant, so you can help the hostas conserve energy for winter by removing these leaves in fall.",
                "Prepare the hostas for winter. Hostas are hardy plants and will survive the winter, but they’ll have a better chance of thriving if you prepare them for the colder months. After the ground freezes, cover the ground around the hostas with fallen leaves, and pack more leaves around the crowns of the plants.[11]\n\nLeave the hostas packed and covered with leaves until after the last frost in spring.\nCovering the plants with organic matter will also help maintain the soil temperature and moisture level."

        "How to Stop a Dog's Unwanted Behavior": {
            "intro": "Has your dog chewed up your favorite pair of penny loafers? Has he bit the mailman or the paper boy too many times? Has he refused to play poker with you no matter how many times you’ve sat him up in a comfortable chair, dressed him up in a smoking jacket, and put a full house in his paws? Each one of these scenarios — ranging from the predictable to the unrealistic — could be considered “unwanted”. Ultimately, you’ll need to train your dog to exhibit “proper” behavior — however, you define it. In order to accomplish any of these goals, you’ll need to understand your dog’s decision making process, assess why it makes the choices it does, and then train it to behave properly.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine the cause of your dog's behavior. Remember that your dog makes all of his choices out of his own self-interest. What is your dog getting for this behavior? Is it your attention, good or bad? Is it turning into a fun game for your dog? After establishing what is causing your dog to act in such a way, you’ll better understand how to change his behavior for the better.[1]\n\nThink broadly about your dog’s behavioral issues. Most likely, your dog is acting badly for a number of reasons. You should consider a number of factors including its diet and the amount of time it spends exercising or locked up in a kennel/cage/room.",
                "Look at your behavior. Do you leap to the dog's beck and call by yelling at it or cajoling it to stop? Maybe this is exactly what your pooch wants from you. Even angry attention is attention — your dog craves to be noticed and be part of the pack. If you only notice or give attention when your dog is acting up, you are responsible for \"training\" him to be bad.[2]",
                "Look at your dog’s environment. Is there something almost “irresistible” in your dog’s space? This might take some detective work or it may be incredibly obvious! If your dog chews on slippers, remove them. If your dog can’t help but bark at people walking outside your house, obstruct its view. Set your dog up for success. When your dog behaves properly, you can reward it. Without triggers, your dog will behave better.[3]",
                "Consider his diet. Is there a pattern to the start of his bad behavior that coincides with a change of diet? A lot like some kids with food or additive intolerances, some dogs can be intolerant of a particular ingredient or preservative in a food and it shows it's as hyperactivity and bad behavior. If you suspect this to be the case, run a detox and either put him back on his original diet, or give him a bland (chicken and rice) diet for a couple of weeks and see if his behavior improves.[4]",
                "Don’t physically punish your dog. If you have punished your dog more than three times for the same behavior, your punishment is not appropriate. Remember - the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! Punishing your dog will damage your relationship with your dog and possibly make the problem worse. A punishment does not have to be physical. Find alternatives that don’t injure or scare your dog. Do not hit or hurt your dog in any way. This breeds vicious, scared dogs, not lovable, huggable pooches.\n\n\nNever hit your dog. Just say \"No!\" firmly instead.Your dog will make the connection between his behavior and what you did to stop him.[5]",
                "Remove physical stimulants. If there are certain objects, toys, and plants in your house or garden that appear to \"set off\" your dog, remove them. Give your dog a toy that it likes, that it will spend an hour playing with. Get a rawhide bone, a real bone, or a safe chew-toy. If there is some way to fill it with treats, your dog will spend even more time trying to get the treats out.[6]",
                "Consider clicker training to train your dog. Clicker training is a method of delivering immediate praise with the help of a clicker. You can click faster than you can give a treat or pet your dog's head. As such, clicker training reinforces good behavior fast enough for a dog's learning speed. It works by creating a positive association between the click sound and rewards. Eventually, your dog will consider the sound of the clicker itself reward enough for good behavior. You can apply the principle of clicker training to any dog command.[7]\n\nClick the clicker device, then immediately give the dog a treat. This creates a positive association with the click sound. Later, that sound will “mark” a behavior as correct so the dog knows that he did something right.[8]\n\nWhen the dog performs a desired behavior, make the click sound, then give him a treat. Once he's performing that behavior consistently, you can give the behavior a command name. Begin tying the command and the behavior together with the help of the clicker.\nFor example, before you ever teach your dog the \"sit\" command, give the click sound, a treat, and praise when you find him sitting. When he begins sitting just to get the treats, start saying the word \"sit\" to get him into position. Pair it with the click sound to reward him. Eventually, he will learn that sitting in response to the \"sit\" command will earn him a click reward.[9]",
                "Reward the good behavior. When your dog does a behavior you do want, such as laying down instead of barking, reward him or her. He will be much more likely to repeat the desired behavior and less likely to repeat the \"bad\" behavior. When incentives for bad behavior are withdrawn and incentives for good behavior are introduced consistently, the dog will soon learn the preferred response.[10]",
                "Tone down your behavior. Try to stop yelling, cajoling, or responding in any manner that gives the dog signals that you are excited, playful, dog-focused. Whilst you may feel very irritated, even angry, the dog may misinterpret this for playfulness or \"joining in\". Resist the temptation. Ignoring and silence is better than yelling — clean the mess up later after you send the dog elsewhere.",
                "Build trust. If your dog is running away from you and hiding, you have a lot of work to do to redevelop your damaged relationship with your dog. Your dog's trust in you has been damaged and it will take a lot of consistency and positive reinforcement training on your part to mend the broken relationship and turn it into something fabulous.[11]",
                "Have patience. Dogs are slow learners. Your dog doesn't have the same contemplative powers that a human does. He can’t learn from one situation and extrapolate for others. To fundamentally change a dog’s behavior requires time and attention. If you have adopted your dog as an older dog with habits that seem to be set in stone, relax. The habits are not set. Remember, dogs are very context specific and that works to our favor. The dog now has a new pack and a new home and if you set the limits and expectations immediately when the dog arrives at his new home, he will learn. Sometimes when you are dealing with a hardwired behavior like a border collie that is herding the neighborhood kids instead of sheep, you cannot easily counter train that out. It is so much easier to manage the situation, rather than try to train him out of it. [12]\n\nHow quickly a bad behavior stops depends on how well established it is. If the problem is an ingrained habit, then it can be difficult to break the association between action and reward. In fact, in the short or medium term the bad behavior can get worse because the dog works even harder to try and get the reward.[13]",
                "Understand that your dog learns by trial and error. You dog acts in a specific way because of an expected reward - whether it be food, play, or attention. When a dog behaves badly, think about what it gets out of it in terms of a reward and then make sure the reward does not happen. Unfortunately, to the canine mind attention is a huge addictive reward — which means shouting at your dog or telling him off is only rewarding the bad behavior. Any action can have three possible outcomes: a pleasant one, an uncertain one, or an unpleasant one.[14]\n\nWhat matters is the dog's response to those outcomes. Each outcome evokes a different response.\nThe pleasant outcome, means the behavior is likely to be repeated\nAn indifferent outcome, means the dog may or may not repeat the behavior\nAn unpleasant outcome means the dog is less likely to repeat the behavior.\nNow when you realize that shouting or chastisement is a reward, it puts a whole different complexion on reacting to bad behavior — you are making the problem worse not better.[15]",
                "Understand that your dog makes direct connections. Dogs live in the moment. If your dog chews up your favorite shoe and you don’t punish him immediately, your dog won’t learn his lesson. If your mother comes home later, discovers the destroyed shoe, and slaps the dog, he will link the punishment to the owner who came home and for no reason slapped him. Thus he becomes wary of the owner. The dog learns nothing about the inherent evils of shoe chewing.[16]\n\nPunishment isn’t clear for dogs oftentimes. If you catch the dog in the act of chewing a shoe, and tell him off immediately, once again he might simply link the punishment to the owner rather than to the inanimate object he’s destroyed.",
                "Think about your dog's routine. Remember that your dog is a creature of habit. Determine if your dog is boredom or anxious. Boredom and a surplus of energy can turn a normally well-behaved dog into a delinquent. Make sure he has plenty of regular exercise and plenty of opportunity to express physical energy chasing and running. This leaves him happily content when he gets back home and less likely to get up to mischief.[17]\n\nIf your dog is destructive when you're out, consider that he might be anxious or bored in your absence. Try giving him a toy that will consume his attention for 20 to 30 minutes — such as a Kong stuffed with dog food. In hot weather, stuff the Kong and pop it in the freezer overnight, so that he gets a cooling dog-food ice pop to keep his mind occupied whilst your out. The chances are if he gets over the initial half an hour without noticing you're gone then he's more likely to settle down for a nap afterwards.[18]"

            "intro": "Some women get a bad rap for having shoe obsessions. With all of the endless styles and colors of footwear, to choose from, who can blame a woman for having her closet stacked from top to bottom with shoes? This guide will teach you how to select shoes to wear with an outfit no matter what the color of the outfit, the occasion or season it is. Get started at step one below.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose shoe colors that match your clothes instead of colors that compete with your clothes.\n\n\nWear simple black heels or flats when wearing a dress with a bright, bold pattern. If you were to wear a more complex shoe, it would be too overwhelming in the opinion of some. Obviously, you can wear whatever shoes you like provided there is no dress code to obey or health and safety issues to consider.\nConsider neutral or 'nude' heels or flats if you have on a sparkly evening top.",
                "Add zest to a plain outfit by wearing brighter shoes.\n\n\nAdd a pop of color by pairing a red heel with a black or brown dress.\nTry a dressy shoe with a funky pattern, like alligator skin, if you have on a simple blouse and neutral trousers or jeans.",
                "Home in on a color found in your clothing if you’re wearing a multi-colored outfit. For instance, if you have on a blouse with a geometric pattern including the colors purple and pink, consider a deep purple shoe.",
                "Avoid strict color matching. Do not wear one solid color from head to toe. If you have on a blue blouse and a blue skirt, avoid wearing blue shoes, unless you want to. Remember the fashion police can't actually charge you with anything!",
                "Consider different shades. If you have a light pink blouse on, try wearing a rose-colored flat or heel instead of a shoe in the same shade of pink.",
                "Select standard colors for professional settings.\n\n\nWear brown or black leather shoes at a conservative office. Grey and navy a red good choices for the office too.\nIncorporate color only if you have a less strict office with a corporate casual dress code.",
                "Be flexible in the spring. You can choose both winter shoes and summer shoes as your wardrobe evolves through the spring.",
                "Lighten up in summer. Summer is the time to enjoy your sandals and espadrilles. Just be sure to enjoy them without socks.",
                "Pull back in the fall. You can still be somewhat flexible as your wardrobe transitions to winter, but avoid the sandals and espadrilles. They don't match with the heavier fabrics and colors of autumn.",
                "Choose practical shoes for winter. Choose loafers, flats and boots. Make sure that your heels are wider to avoid slippage.",
                "Pair stiletto heels with clothing that already helps elongate your leg, such as pencil skirts and slim pants. The stiletto creates the illusion of further length, making your legs look even more slender and attractive.",
                "Choose low heels, like kitten heels, for a more versatile option. Kitten heels look appropriate for the office while still looking feminine enough for a night out.",
                "Avoid heels with ankle straps or T-straps if you have short legs. Straps also have a tendency to cut off the leg, making it look short.",
                "Avoid heels that are more than four inches tall if you have short legs. Ultra high heels make the calf muscle flex more, which leaves your leg looking less slender.",
                "Wear oval-shaped or square-toed heels if you have large feet. Avoid tapered or pointy heels that may end up making your feet look even larger.",
                "Avoid wearing extremely high heels or sexy, strappy designs in professional settings, depending on your profession..... A low to moderately high heel is fine, but keep things conservative. A closed-toe, low-heeled pump works best.",
                "Wear heels for formal and semi-formal events. Go with closed-toe or open-toe pumps for banquets and other formal events. Opt for closed-toe, open-toe, or strappy heels for semi-formal occasions like cocktail parties.",
                "Try wearing your heels with casual clothes to add a touch of style to your everyday wear. Throw on a pair of stilettos with your jeans and fitted t-shirt to give the outfit an automatic style boost.",
                "Select a pair of low-heeled sandals for a versatile, feminine look. Wear low-heeled sandals with virtually any skirt length or pant length.",
                "Consider a pair of strappy, high-heeled sandals the next time you wear your little black dress or similar evening wear. Higher heeled sandals make your legs look especially long, thanks to both the heel height and the extra skin showing on the top of your foot.",
                "Save flip-flops for short-term casual settings. Limit them to the beach or, if necessary, for running errands.",
                "Wear walking sandals with casual outfits. Shorts, capri pants, and some dress-down sundresses work with walking sandals, but avoid wearing them with dressier clothes.",
                "Use heeled-sandals to make casual clothes look a little nicer. For instance, try matching a pair of kitten-heel sandals with a casual denim skirt and fitted blouse to make the outfit a little dressier.",
                "Wear flats with knee-length or above-the-knee skirts, capri pants or Bermuda shorts.\n\n\nAvoid flats with long skirts. In many cases, though not all, flats worn with maxi-skirts can make a woman look dowdy.\nIf you do wear ballet flats with mid- to maxi-skirts, consider a less-than-flat ballet flat with a slightly elevated heel.",
                "Select a pair of decorative flats to dress an outfit up. Select a pair of less decorative flats for casual occasions.",
                "Also avoid flats with skinny pants unless you have narrow hips. Otherwise, you risk making your legs look disproportionate.",
                "Avoid casual flats at the office or in other professional settings. You may choose a formal style, such as a simple flat made of black or brown leather.",
                "Consider flats for some semi-formal occasions. For example, try matching a decorative pair of flats with a nice sundress for a garden party or other outdoor dress-up occasion.",
                "Save your boots for autumn and winter. Boots evoke images of colder weather and prevent airflow from reaching your foot, making them warmer.",
                "Wear a pair of short, skinny-heeled boots with a boot-cut or straight-legged trouser or dark-wash jean. The heel of this boot makes it sexy and helps it to elongate your leg, while the boot style makes it appropriate for heavy fabrics.",
                "Consider a pair of wide-heeled fashion boots when you want to look stylish but are afraid of slipping on icy sidewalks. While they do not elongate your leg quite as well skinny-heeled boots, they do dress up an outfit.",
                "Select a pair of fashion boots that does not cut off your leg at its thickest point. Knee-high boots work well because many women's legs are narrowest directly below the knee. Knee-high fashion boots also make an excellent choice for skirts and dresses.",
                "Wear snow boots for snow and rain boots for rain. Switch to your fashionable boots when you're comfortably inside.",
                "Consider a pair of oxfords or loafers for the office. As a conservative style, loafers are appropriate for nearly any professional setting. They can go brilliantly with trousers as well as with dresses and skirts.",
                "Select a pair of low-heeled loafers to wear with knee-length pencil or A-line skirt.",
                "Wear either flat or low-heeled oxfords with trousers.",
                "Wear athletic shoes designed for your sport. If you are a runner, for instance, wear running shoes with supportive insoles.",
                "Match athletic shoes with athletic clothes. If you have workout clothes on, wear workout shoes.",
                "Stick with low-key sneakers for non-athletic clothes. Avoid running shoes or other obviously athletic shoes for everyday wear.",
                "Wear pseudo-athletic shoes that slip on with an open back for daily errands or for work in the garden.",
                "Take a picture of the color that you would like to match.",
                "Go to www.skippysearch.com and upload the image.",

        "How to Manage Multiple Projects": {
            "intro": "In today’s fast paced business world, it’s likely that you’ll have more than one thing to work on at any given time. To continually succeed, you need to know how to manage multiple projects at once. This starts with assigning priorities to everything you work on, writing detailed plans, and keeping project information together. You can practice working on dreaded projects first, transitioning between projects when you get stuck, and reducing pointless tasks. When you are managing other people, it is good to know how they communicate and make sure you delegate and let people work.",
            "steps": [
                "Prioritize your projects to keep things in perspective. Not everything you work on has the same payoff for finishing it or consequences for not finishing it. As you work on projects and constantly add more to your list, use some kind of system to remind yourself what is the most important and what you can put off for long amounts of time.[1]\n\nOne way to prioritize is to take note of when things are due and make sure you mostly work on the things that are due the soonest. You will still need to work on longer term projects over time, rather than waiting until the deadline is upon you.\nYou can also prioritize based on the size of the project, or the difficulty of getting it done. It can be helpful to set a higher priority on difficult projects so you avoid putting them off and hurrying them at the last minute.\nDevelop a color coding system that gives you an at-a-glance visual of relative priority levels. For example, however you decide to assign priorities, make red the highest, purple the middle, and blue the level you can hold off on.",
                "Write out a detailed process for each project. Every project will entail multiple phases, steps, or aspects. Make a habit of breaking projects down into specific chunks of work. Write these out and make a plan for how you will work through each step of the process. Assign a time limit for each task and stick to that, but overestimate how long it will take so you have some cushion.[2]\n\nThis is the kind of habit that may seem like it is just using extra time, but if you have a detailed guide to what needs to be done before you start, it helps guard against forgetting something along the way.\nDon’t be afraid to go overboard on the details because the more you expand things out, the clearer it will be what you need to get done. Plus you will feel like you are accomplishing more as you work through each small part of the project.",
                "Keep important information in a single, designated place. Storing vital information on your various projects in one location helps ensure you never lose track of it. This could mean one notebook or spreadsheet, or one specific folder for all project documents. This single place could have sections for basic info on all the projects and specific info on each individual project.[3]\n\nIf it doesn’t make sense to store information from separate projects in a central place, at least be sure to store all of the information for each single project in one place.\nWhen you are working with a team who all need access to the set of documents, make sure they have any passwords necessary or copies of any physical documents.\nOnce a project is finished, consider trashing its documents (if it makes sense to do so) or relocating all of the project’s information. Maybe you would never throw away or delete work you’ve done, but you can at least store it in a separate place designated specifically for finished items.",
                "Pick something you dread and get to work on it first thing in the morning. Avoiding things you dread doing never makes it easier to do them. Force yourself to tackle the hard stuff early in the day while you are somewhat fresh. You’ll rarely stop dreading something if you put it off longer. Once the dreaded task is completed, you’ll feel a burden lifted and it will spur you on for the rest of the day.[4]\n\nDreaded tasks may not always be things that are prioritized highest, but it’s an exception to the priority rule.\nIf you are dreading something that also happens to be a time-consuming task, weigh this in mind. Maybe you can tackle a significant chunk of the process in the morning one day and finish it in the morning the next day.",
                "Make course corrections when you hit a wall. You’ll have times when you are working on something important, but you just hit a wall and stop making progress. Staring at the wall and beating yourself up are not helpful, so make a smooth transition on to other work. You may need to come back quickly, but taking a break will help keep you productive.[5]\n\nSwitching off to another task may not always be an option, especially if you are under a tight time crunch. Consider your situation and act accordingly. Maybe you don’t have time to switch completely to a different project, but you can take a five minute breather and refocus.\nIf you have the time to switch off to a different project, give that one your full attention. It’s no use changing projects if your mind is stuck on the first one.",
                "Eliminate unnecessary aspects of the work. You may have habits while working on projects, but you realize those things are not directly contributing to the work at hand. Don’t make extra work for yourself. Evaluate your processes and look for things that you can stop doing. This will free up time for important things and will streamline your efforts.[6]\n\nFor example, maybe you always make a themed bulletin board for new projects, which is really only a tactic to put off getting started. Or maybe you come up with funny code names for team members, but you never actually use them during the project.\nYou don’t want to start cutting things out that are worthwhile practices, but try to be honest about what things contribute and what things don’t.",
                "Set limits and say no. You have a threshold for how much you can realistically manage. It’s important to know that limit and to stay in the sweet spot. If you are at maximum capacity and another opportunity presents itself, learn to say no. It may be better to miss out on something and actually get done what you already have than taking on another project and failing them all.[7]\n\nLearning where exactly your limit is may take some trial and error. If you don’t get it right the first time, don’t give up on yourself. You have to find your limit somehow, even if it means dropping the ball once or twice.\nMaybe the newly offered project is not something you can afford to pass up. Carefully consider when this is the case. You may burn a bridge by letting go of something you already committed to working on.",
                "Assign tasks and don’t micromanage. When you have a team you work with or oversee, it is always best to delegate as much of the work as you can. You may tend to want to be in control, but you have people helping for a reason. Give people assignments at the outset of a project and let them do what they are assigned. Don’t take back control partway through.[8]\n\nWhen you have good workers, a group of people can get more done than you can all alone. If you tend to do all of the work but delegating is an option, consider passing off some of the work. If you have workers available to you, don’t let their help go to waste.\nIf you are in charge, it’s still your responsibility to make sure everything is getting done. Set some times that you will check in on progress and then leave your team alone except during those specific times.",
                "Learn your team members’ communication styles and work with them. You may be in charge of people who work very differently than you. To be effective, you need to accept that. Knowing how each member of your team communicates best will help you get more done. Without going overboard, cater a little to each person so you can get the best work possible out of them.[9]\n\nThis could apply specifically to forms of communication like phone and email. Some team members may prefer a call when you are giving them feedback. Others will value the efficiency of email.\nIt also applies to who likes to joke, who prefers to be serious, and how you need to frame feedback. You want to get along with your team as much as possible so they want to work with you.\nKeep notes on your people so you can be sure to apply what you learn about them. You may ask them directly about some of their preferences or you may do better to figure it out over time.",
                "Stay in communication regarding progress. Whether you are in charge or you report to someone else, progress updates are important. Set times with people you are in charge of for them to update you. Be proactive about reporting to your supervisor as you get things done. Consistent, if not constant, updates will keep a project moving smoothly.\n\n\nIt can be helpful to have established progress report deadlines at various stages of a project. This could be daily for short projects, or once a week for projects that are ongoing.\nThis is especially important if one part of a project builds on the part before it. If Tom is waiting for Leslie to finish her part before he can work on his, he needs to know how far along she is.\nSetting expectations in the beginning for how progress updates will be handled is important. You don’t want to get halfway through a project and surprise people with a progress check."

        "wikiHow to Lose Weight Without Exercising": {
            "intro": "Weight loss generally occurs when the body expends more calories than it takes in. That means, you have to burn off or eat fewer calories that you consume through meals and snacks. Many people cut calories from their diet and burn calories through exercise to achieve weight loss. Working out on a regular basis is helpful for weight loss, but may not be practical for some people due to health conditions, time restraints, or lack of interest. However, research shows that when it comes to weight loss, diet plays a much more important role compared to exercise.[1] It's easier to decrease caloric intake by modifying your diet compared to burning off a significant amount of calories through exercise. Making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle can help you lose weight safely and effectively without planned exercise.",
            "steps": [
                "Count calories. Weight loss programs usually require you to modify your total calorie intake. Counting calories and being aware of how much you eat can help you lose weight. In general, you'll want to cut out about 500–750 calories daily to lose about one to two pounds weekly.[2]\n\nFigure out how many calories you can cut from your daily diet by first calculating the number of calories you should take in each day. Do this by searching online for a calorie calculator, then inputting your weight, height, age and activity level in order to calculate your recommended caloric intake. Each person is different, so it's best to get your own, personalized number.\nDo not consume less than 1200 calories daily. A diet that's too low in calories puts you at risk for nutrient deficiencies as you cannot eat enough food to meet your daily requirements for most vitamins, minerals, and protein.[3]",
                "Remember, your weight is a balancing act, and calorie intake is only a part of the equation. Fad diets may promise you that counting carbs (carbohydrates) or eating a mountain of grapefruit will make the pounds drop off; but when it comes to weight loss, it's calories that count. Weight loss comes down to burning more calories than you take in. You can do that by reducing extra calories from food and beverages, and increasing calories burned through physical activity.[4]",
                "Write yourself a meal plan. If you are not exercising to burn calories, you must trim them from your diet in order to lose weight. Writing out a meal plan can help you plot out all your meals and snacks and make sure they fit into your pre-determined calorie range.\n\n\nSpend some time writing out all your meals, snacks, and beverages for a few days or a week.\nAllot a certain caloric amount for each meal. For example: 300-calorie breakfast, two 500-calorie bigger meals, and one to two 100-calorie snacks. This may help you choose what foods to eat for meals and snacks throughout the day.\nInclude foods from all five food groups most days. Review your meal plan to make sure you're getting adequate amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy.\nHaving all your meals and snacks planned in advance may keep you from making poor nutrition choices when you're in a rush.\nKeep snacks conveniently located and ready in your fridge, car, backpack or purse.",
                "Eat a balanced diet. A diet that is calorie controlled and includes all five food groups is a good foundation for healthy weight loss.[5] You should include all of the following most days:\n\n\nFruits and vegetables. These foods are dense, filling, low-calorie and low-fat. Not only are fruits and veggies great for your waistline; they have copious amounts of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that you need for long-term health.[6] Aim to make 1/2 of your meals fruits and/or vegetables.\nLean protein. Foods like poultry, eggs, pork, lean beef, legumes, dairy products, and tofu are great sources of lean protein. Protein will help keep you satisfied longer and may curb hunger cravings.[7] Aim to include 3-4 oz of protein at each meal — this is about the size of a deck of cards.\n100% whole grains. Foods that are whole grains are high in fiber and some vitamins and minerals.[8] Quinoa, oats, brown rice, millet, and 100% whole wheat pasta and bread are examples of whole grains to include in your diet. Limit your grains to about 1/2 cup or 1 oz per meal.",
                "Snack healthy. Including one to two low-calorie snacks is appropriate when you're trying to lose weight. Many times a snack will help support your weight loss.[9]\n\nSnacking may be appropriate when there is more than five or six hours between your meals. Sometimes, going for long periods of time without eating may make it harder for you to stick to your planned meal or portion sizes as you may be overly hungry.[10]\n\nMost snacks included in a weight loss plan should be calorie controlled. Aim to keep snacks between 100-200 calories.[11]\n\nHealthy snacks include: 1/4 cup of nuts, one individual greek yogurt, a hard boiled egg or celery and peanut butter.",
                "Choose healthier cooking techniques. Don't sabotage the best of intentions with poor preparation methods. Cooking methods that use a lot of oil, butter, or other high-fat sauces or seasonings may cause your weight loss to plateau or slow.[12]\n\nTry cooking methods that use little to no added fat. Try: steaming, grilling, braising, roasting and poaching/boiling.\nSwitch to extra virgin olive oil or canola oil. When substituted for saturated fats (like butter), these healthy monounsaturated fats can help to improve blood cholesterol levels, thereby reducing risk for heart disease and obesity.[13]\n\nAvoid cooking techniques such as deep fat frying or pan frying. Also avoid cooking methods that use a lot of butter, oil, or margarine.",
                "Drink adequate amounts of fluids. Staying well-hydrated is also essential to weight loss. Many times, thirst can feel similar to hunger and trigger you to eat. Drinking enough fluid can help prevent this mistake and promote weight loss.[14]\n\nAim for about 64 oz or about eight glasses of clear, sugar-free liquids each day. This is a general recommendation, but is a good place to start.[15]\n\nFluids that will count toward your daily goal include: water, sugar-free flavored waters, plain tea, and coffee without cream or sugar.",
                "Ditch alcohol and sugary beverages. Both alcoholic beverages and sugary beverages contain excess calories that may work against your weight loss plan. Ideally, completely pass these up as long as you desire continued weight loss.[16]\n\nSugary beverages to avoid include: regular soda, sweetened tea, sweetened coffee drinks, sports drinks and juices.\nAt the maximum, women should consume one glass or less of alcohol daily and men should consume two or less daily. Again, if continued weight loss is desired, alcohol should be avoided.[17]",
                "Weigh yourself once or twice a week. Monitoring your progress is important when you're losing weight. Stepping on the scale regularly can help you see how effective your diet program is going and whether or not you need to make any changes.\n\n\nRemember, safe weight loss is about one to two pounds per week. Be patient with your progress. You're more likely to sustain slow and steady weight loss in the long-term.[18]\n\nFor the most accurate pattern of results, it's best to weigh yourself at the same time of day, on the same day of the week and in the same clothes (or choose to go without clothes).\nIf your weight loss has plateaued or you've begun to gain weight, recheck your meal plans and food journals and see if you can cut out any more calories to help weight loss.",
                "Find a support group. Having friends, family members or co-workers supporting you through your weight loss plan may help you continue to lose weight and maintain it long-term.[19] Build a support group to help you stay on track.\n\n\nSee if others you know also want to lose weight. Many times people find it easier to tackle weight loss together as a group.\nYou can also try finding online support groups or support groups that meet in person on a weekly or monthly basis.\nGet support by working with a registered dietitian; he/she can customize your meal plan and provide on-going support.",
                "Reward yourself. Having a motivating and enticing reward at the end of your weight loss goals can help push you through to the end. Set up something exciting for yourself as you meet your goals. Ideas to try include:\n\n\nBuying yourself new shoes or clothes.\nTreating yourself to a round of golf or other favorite sport.\nGetting a massage or other spa treatment.\nAvoid food-related rewards, as these can trigger old habits that might not be conducive to weight loss.",
                "Start a food journal. Journaling your meals, snacks and drinks can help motivate you to stay on track. Also, people who journal typically lose more weight and keep it off longer compared to those who do not track their food.\n\n\nYou can either purchase a journal or download a food journal app. Try to track as many days as you can. Again, you're more likely to stay on track and stick with your meal plan the more often you record your foods.\nKeep track of your food journal. This may be a good resource to evaluate how well your diet is going and how effective it is for weight loss.",
                "Get adequate rest. Sleeping seven to nine hours each night is recommended for general health and wellness.[20] However, adequate sleep is also important for weight loss. Studies show that people who sleep less than six or seven hours nightly or have poor sleep weigh more than those who get adequate rest.[21]\n\nGo to bed earlier. If you have to get up early, try to get in bed earlier to help increase your total sleep time.\nTo make sure you have a sound and undisturbed sleep, remove all electronics — like your phone, tablet device or computer — from your bedroom.\nPractice good sleep hygiene to ensure you get the most out of your sleep.",
                "Increase your baseline physical activity. Baseline activity is activity that you already do everyday — walking up stairs, walking to and from your car, and doing daily chores.[22] This type of activity does not burn a lot of calories, but can help support your weight loss.\n\n\nAlthough it's very possible to lose weight without going to the gym or working out regularly, there are definitely benefits of being moderately active. Even by simply increasing baseline activity, you may notice more weight loss, improved mood, or increased energy.[23]\n\nTry to increase your baseline activity each day. Try: parking further away, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, standing during commercial breaks, or delivering messages to co-workers in person instead of email.\nEncourage social gatherings that are a bit more active. Frisbee, golf, swimming, or a simple picnic in the park with friends are activities that will get you moving (and get you fresh air). If weather is an issue, do something indoors like dancing."

            "intro": "Sweaty hands can be embarrassing, but they are easy to treat. This wikiHow will show you several ways of treating sweaty hands.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash your hands. Sweaty hands don't dry up on their own, so you'll have to wash them more often than most people do in order to keep them dry. Wash them when the amount of sweat starts to bother you, then thoroughly dry them off with a towel or washcloth.\n\nWhen you aren't washing up for dinner or after using the bathroom, it's fine to use plain water, rather than soapy water, to wash your hands. This way you'll avoid drying out the skin on the back side of your hands from using too much soap.\n\n\nto Treat Sweaty Hands\n\n\n\n\nCarry alcohol-based hand sanitizer (not antibacterial) for the times when you can't get to a sink to wash your hands. A squirt of alcohol works to temporarily dry up the sweat.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 1Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0c/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-1Bullet2-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-1Bullet2-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nCarry a cloth or a package of paper towels so you can wipe off your hands when you need to. Use them before situations when you'll be shaking hands with someone.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 1Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-1Bullet3-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-1Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Cool off your hands. Many people get sweaty hands when their bodies are slightly overheated, so cooling them off can be a quick and effective remedy. Hold your hands in front of a fan or air conditioner to dry the moisture and slow down the production of sweat.\n\nTo cool your hands down quickly when you aren't at home, find a bathroom and run them under cold water, then dry them thoroughly with a paper towel.\nAvoid getting too hot in the first place, if possible. Don't use a heater unless it's absolutely necessary, and turn down the thermostat in your room.",
                "Sprinkle some powder on your hands. If you're at home and don't mind your hands looking a little white, sprinkle them with a powder to temporarily absorb the sweat. This can come in handy if your sweaty hands inhibit daily activities like lifting weights, jumping rope or complete chores that require a tight grip. Try the following types of powder:\n\nBaby powder, either scented or unscented.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 3Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-3Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nBaking soda or corn starch.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 3Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-3Bullet2-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-3Bullet2-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Don't use items that cause more sweating to occur. Keeping your hands free of articles of clothing and products that inhibit air flow will cause your hands to stay moist, rather than naturally getting the chance to dry. Avoid the following items whenever possible:\n\nGloves, mittens and other items that cover your hands. Wear them when it's freezing outside, of course, but avoid wearing gloves indoors or in situations where they aren't necessary. Gloves are effective if you want to hide the sweatiness of your hands, but they'll keep your hands so warm that they'll sweat more than usual.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 4Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f2/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-4Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-4Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nPetroleum-based lotions and other skin products. Petroleum jelly is used by people with dry skin to seal in moisture, and it has the same effect on sweaty skin. Petroleum jelly can prevent your sweat from drying and cause your hands to become greasy. The same goes for coconut oil and other cosmetic oils used to hold moisture against skin.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Treat Sweaty Hands Step 4Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/63/Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-4Bullet2-Version-2.jpg/aid1124727-v4-728px-Treat-Sweaty-Hands-Step-4Bullet2-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"410\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Start using an antiperspirant. You may not think to use an antiperspirant on your hands, since they are usually used in the underarm area, but the same chemicals that prevent your armpits from sweating excessively can help your hands, too.[1]\n\nChoose an unscented \"clinical strength\" antiperspirant containing aluminum zirconium, which many find to be effective.\nPrescription-strength antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate, a stronger antiperspirant chemical, are also available; talk to your doctor.",
                "Stay relaxed. Excessive perspiration is often triggered by anxiety and stress. Practice meditation, yoga or another activity that will help reduce your stress and prevent your sweat glands from going into overdrive.[2]\n\nIf you get sweaty while thinking of a certain problem that's bothering you, think through a solution and tackle it head-on. If you need help, consider talking to a counselor.\nFor a quick solution to anxiety-related sweating, have a seat, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Try to calm your mind before going about your day.",
                "Look into iontophoresis. This procedure involves using water to send an electrical current under the skin, which temporarily prevents sweating from occurring.[3]\n\nDuring iontophoresis, the hands are submerged in water while an electrical current is sent through the water. A tingling sensation may be felt, but the procedure is painless.\nIontophoresis kits are available for home use. Talk to your doctor about purchasing one so you can use it any time.",
                "Take an oral medication. Oral medicines known as anticholinergics stop sweating as a side effect, so doctors sometimes prescribe them to treat excessive sweating in the hands.[4]\n\nThis might be a good choice if you aren't an athlete, but if you're an active person, it can be dangerous to interfere with your body's production of sweat, which functions to cool the body when it becomes heated from exercise.\nAnticholinergics can also cause dry mouth and other side effects.[5]",
                "Research botulinum toxin injections. Botox injections, which are often used to smooth wrinkles in the face or plump up the lips, can also be used to block the nerves that produce sweat.[6] However, injections can be painful, and they only stop excessive sweating temporarily.",
                "Consider getting a sympathectomy. This procedure involves surgically removing a nerve from inside the chest, permanently disrupting the nerve signal that controls the body's sweating.[7]\n\nThis surgery should be considered only as a last resort, since in half of the cases the body compensates by overproducing sweat in a different area. The sweating in your hands might go away, but you may experience increased sweating on your back or in another area.[8]\n\nIf you wish to undergo this procedure, find a doctor who has done it before. Don't risk getting such a risky procedure done by someone unfamiliar with the process.[9]"

            "steps": [
                "Get to know her. Talk to her and listen to her. Ask her about her family and where she grew up, her religion and politics, and what she likes to do for fun. Don’t be critical or rude about her answers: they are hers, not yours! Respect her ideas, her opinions, and her beliefs. Girls like it when you treat them like people. If you want girls to find you attractive, respecting them as people is a great place to start.\n\n\nFor example, ask her about her favorite hobby, and then ask her how she got in to that hobby. This is a great way to work into talking about where and how she grew up, her family, etc.",
                "Find things you have in common. She likes Metallica….you like Metallica…..bam! You now have something to talk about! Ask her about the music she listens to, the movies she watches, and the things she does in her spare time. Find some common ground and you will have a great way to get to know each other and bond.",
                "Be a good friend. If we guaranteed you wouldn’t get friend-zoned, we’d be lying. But being friends with a girl and showing her what a wonderful person you are is the best way to attract her. Show her how happy she’d be with you and then see how much happier you are with her.\n\n\nBe supportive when she is having a hard day, help take her mind off of her problems, be available when she needs help, and listen to her when she talks.",
                "Don’t be a creeper. Don’t stare at her and then avoid eye contact. Don’t hover around her and then never actually manage to say anything. Don’t stare at….certain parts of her anatomy (however tempting). Don’t make weird sexual advances if you don’t know her well and definitely don’t use pick up lines. Things like this will freak her out and definitely make you a lot less attractive.",
                "Build your self esteem and confidence. Self confidence and self esteem are very attractive qualities. Girls will fall head over heels for a guy that is confident in himself and what he can do. Do things that build your confidence in yourself like volunteering, learning a new skill, or traveling.\n\n\nYou can build confidence by volunteering with an organization like Homes for Humanity. This will give you the chance to prove to yourself and everyone else that you can do something and make a difference.\nYou can also boost your confidence by learning a new skill, like a second or third language. This can be done easily and for free online with sites like Livemocha.",
                "Don’t compare yourself to others. This is not going to make you feel any better about yourself. The only person you can ever be is you and that is great! Show the world how awesome you can be and stop trying to be somebody else’s brand of awesome.\n\n\nDon’t try to act like anyone other than yourself either. Girls will notice you trying to hard and being all fake and they will not find that attractive. Acting like some gangsta thug when you grew up rich in the suburbs? Sorry, poser. She’ll notice. Just be you and be happy about being you. Girls will find that very attractive.",
                "Take care of yourself and your appearance. Don’t neglect personal hygiene or your wardrobe. Why would a girl like you if you didn’t even like yourself enough to take care of your body? Wash your hair and body regularly, use deodorant, wear clothes that don’t have holes or stains, and brush your teeth.\n\n\nDon't worry too much about wearing brand name clothes. She'll notice a lot more if your clothes fit you well and are in colors that make you look great, not what letter is written on the chest.\nDon't go overboard, of course. Some gel in your hair is probably good, but it shouldn't look wet and be rock hard, you know?",
                "Be approachable. Don’t seem angry, upset, douchey or otherwise unpleasant to talk to. If you seem like you’re mad at her every time you talk to her, why would she want to talk to you, much less date you? Smile, be friendly, and try to make yourself easy to talk to by, you know, talking.",
                "Be an amazing person. Be someone that girls want to date. You don’t have to be smart but at least try to be knowledgeable and curious. Be a kind person that works hard to improve the lives of people around you. And do something with your life. That part is really important. Get out there and work to make a better life for yourself.\n\n\nYou can become more knowledgeable by reading about things that interest you. Did you know they have entire books about the evolution of weapons like swords? Books about how they think dinosaurs killed their prey? Yeah, library time.\nConsider your dreams. What do you want for your life? What is your great passion? Showing that passion is really attractive to girls: they want to think that you'll love them as much as you love...baseball or whatever.",
                "Be kind and funny. Try to help her and always smile at her. A smile can make her day much better. Don't try to act cool and don't always talk to your friends when she's around. Try to set some time alone with her and talk to her in a kind voice.",
                "Keep up in school. You don't have to get perfect grades, but at least shoot for \"A\"s and \"B\"s. Get good grades, but don't become arrogant either. Offer to help her with assignments she is having trouble with or offer to help her study for a test. Don't take it personally if she says she doesn't want your help though.\n\n\nStaying organized is also very important. You don't want to look like a mess in class all the time trying to find your homework in front of her. Most girls like organized boys that turn in their assignments on time.",
                "Join sports. This can not only attract many girls, especially cheerleaders and other girls that also play sports, but also boost your self-confidence. Girls like boys who are in shape and are athletic. Tryout for sports and get on a team with people that go to your school."

        "wikiHow to Prepare Carrots for Your Hamster": {
            "intro": "Carrots can be a great, healthy treat for your hamster. However, before you feed your hamster a carrot you should take some time to prepare the vegetable. Make sure it's cut into small, smooth pieces. Allow your hamster some time to get used to the new food. Then, keep an eye on him for a few days to make sure he can easily digest his new treat.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash the carrot thoroughly. Produce purchased in the supermarket is often sprayed with commercial pesticides before being picked and sold. It's a good idea to wash carrots thoroughly before serving them to a hamster.\n\n\nMake sure your carrot is free of any bruises or damage. Cut off any bruised or damaged sections. Then, wash your own hands for about 20 seconds in warm water using soap.[1]\n\nHold the carrot under cool running water. Rub the carrot as you wash it to get rid of any dirt or grime.[2]\n\nDry the carrot with a clean paper cloth or towel.[3]",
                "Cut it up into small parts. As hamsters are small, you'll need to the cut the carrot before serving. Cut it into tiny pieces. If you have a food processor or a cheese shredder, consider using this device on the carrot to grind it into thin, shredded segments. This will be easier for your hamster to eat.",
                "Trim down sharp edges. After cutting the carrot, check for sharp edges. You should not give your hamster food that has sharp edges. These can puncture the insides of your hamster's mouth and, in rare cases, even cause an abscess. If you see any pointy edges on the carrot, cut them off with a knife to form a more rounded edge.[4]",
                "Use fresh carrots with no additives. Dried vegetables made for human consumption often contain additives and preservatives that might not be safe for your hamster. Only use fresh carrots that have not been processed. These are the safest and healthiest for your hamster.[5]",
                "Prepare the food bowl. You should serve your hamster food and treats in a small bowl. Go for a ceramic food dish over a plastic one. Ceramic dishes are sturdier and hamsters are less likely to chew on them. Place the bowl in an area of the cage that's far away from where your hamster usually uses the bathroom.[6]",
                "Introduce new foods in small amounts. New foods, even healthy foods, should be introduced slowly. Unfamiliar substances can bother a hamster's digestion, causing constipation or diarrhea. Give your hamster only a small portion of the carrot at first, like one thin slice or shred.[7]",
                "Allow your hamster to try the carrot. After placing the carrot in your hamster's bowl, allow him to eat his new food. You can try mixing the carrot in with his regular pellets or dry food to try to encourage him to taste the carrot.\n\n\nNot every hamster will take to every type of vegetable. Your hamster may simply dislike carrots. If this is the case, there are a variety of other vegetables you can add to your hamster's diet.",
                "Watch for digestive changes. You want to make sure your hamster is able to digest carrots well. If your hamster has trouble processing carrots, you'll want to remove them from his diet. Keep an eye on your hamster for a few days after introducing the new food to make sure he's able to keep it down.\n\n\nExamine your hamster's rear end. If you notice any smears or stains, he may have diarrhea. A wet tail is also a sign of diarrhea in a hamster. It may also indicate a bacterial infection in the gut.\nIf you notice an absence of droppings in your hamster's cage, he may be suffering from constipation. This can happen when being introduced to a new food.\nAny digestive problems that go on for longer than a week should be evaluated by a veterinarian.",
                "Increase the amount of carrot if your hamster enjoys it. If your hamster digests the carrot and seems to enjoy the food, add more carrot to his diet. Gradually increase the amount of carrot you feed him.\n\n\nHowever, keep the amount of carrot relatively small overall. Your hamster needs nutrients from his pellets and other store-bought foods. Too much of a certain food he enjoys, like carrots, may discourage him from eating his pellets.[8]",
                "Consider introducing your hamster to other fresh veggies. Hamsters enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables as part of a balanced diet. For veggies, you can try squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, romaine lettuce, and spinach. For fruits, try berries, apples, bananas, and pears.[9]\n\nDo not feed your hamster citrus fruit like lemons or oranges. Citrus fruit can be toxic to a hamster.[10]\n\nWash any produce you feed your hamster thoroughly. Always introduce new foods gradually."

        "How to Tell Your Ex You Don't Want to Be Friends": {
            "intro": "You’ve probably heard the old cliche, “I hope we can still be friends.” While everyone’s heard this, not everyone is able to actually do it after a breakup. Attempting to be friends right after a breakup can often be unhealthy for both people. If your ex says they want to be friends, don’t worry. You can say no without feeling guilty or having to offer an explanation.",
            "steps": [
                "Communicate your wishes clearly. Once you know that you don’t want to be friends, it’s important to say so. You don’t need to rationalize your feelings. Particularly if you were the person who was dumped, you are under no obligation to explain yourself.[1]\n\nKeep it short and sweet. Simply say, “I’m sorry, but I don’t actually want to be friends with you,” or, “No. Being friends isn’t going to work for me.”\nDon’t make promises or offers for the future. Sure, you might end up being friends again at some point, but there’s no reason to promise that now. Don’t say anything like, “Let’s check back in in six months,” or, “I’ll let you know when I’m ready.” Statements like this keep you tied to the person and can prevent you from moving on.\nIf you were the person who initiated the breakup, you can say something like, “I know this is hard, but I don’t think trying to be friends would be good for either of us,” or, “I can understand wanting to be friends, but I can’t do that.”\nIf you're afraid that your ex might themselves or you, you can suggest resources that could help them. You may want to give them the number of a grief counselor or therapy center. You can say, \"I can't help you through this, but here are the numbers of professionals who can.\" You can also alert their friends or family that they may need the extra support right now.",
                "Have a conversation for closure, if possible. Sometimes, a relationship ends and you feel that you’ve gotten whatever kind of closure you need. However, in some situations, you may still feel that you have unanswered questions, or unresolved feelings. Having a final conversation can sometimes help clarify feelings, and make saying no to a friendship easier.[2]\n\nWith closure, you may find that you no longer feel the need for a friendship. That’s because you’re no longer using the promise of friendship as a way to get the answers you feel you need.\nThe other person may not be interested in a conversation. In this case, you may need to talk to a counselor or to close friends in order to process your feelings and move on.\nHave the conversation in a place and time where you can have privacy and not be rushed. Exchanging thoughts and feelings via e-mail or letters can also be helpful.",
                "Establish new boundaries. It’s likely not enough to simply say, “I don’t want to be friends.” You need to also be clear about what your new boundaries will be. This will vary depending on how intertwined your lives are.[3]\n\nRemember that it’s okay to make strong demands. For example, you can say, “I don’t want you attending any party or event where you know I will be.” Your ex may not be willing to accept your terms, but you should begin the negotiation by at least being clear about what your ideal situation is.\nIf you live together, one of you should move out as soon as possible. Continuing to live together perpetuates unhealthy dynamics and prevents both of you from moving on. You don’t want to be friends with your ex, so why would you want to live with them?\nIf your ex is dependent on you financially, you may need to reach out to their friends or family and ask them to help support your ex right now. If you're able to, you may offer your ex a nominal sum of money to help them support themselves for a short period, provide care for your children, or pay for a temporary place to live. In marriages with prenuptial agreements, the details of an arrangement like this will have already been settled.",
                "Create guidelines for unavoidable contact. If you have children or pets together, work together, or share a social circle, there will likely be times that contact is unavoidable. Make a clear plan that you can both agree to for how to handle those times.[4]\n\nTake control of the situation by clearly stating your needs. Keep in mind though, that you may need to negotiate. For example, you may never want to see your ex again, but if you work together, you may need to say something like, “I understand that you need to keep working here, so we’ll have to interact occasionally. I can do that, but I won’t be engaging with you socially at work, and please don’t visit my department unless it’s unavoidable.”\nIf you have children together, you’ll need to establish boundaries around custody, holidays, milestones (such as graduations), and family gatherings. If you feel strongly averse to interacting with your ex at all, you may need to seek the help of a family counselor or lawyer.\nWrite down the guidelines you’ve both established so you have something to reference if there’s a misunderstanding later.",
                "Refrain from contacting them. This may be difficult, particularly if you still don’t feel closure, or if you’re deeply heartbroken. It’s natural to want to reach out or to find reasons to contact your ex. However, do your best to cut off all contact until you’ve had time to heal.[5]\n\nIt can help to delete their number from your phone. This can help prevent impulsive calling or texting.\nIf you feel the need to contact them, spend some time writing in a journal instead. You can write them an imaginary letter, or write out out how you’re feeling. This can help you process feelings without actually reaching out to them.\nIf you feel the urge to contact your ex, call a friend instead and tell them how you’re feeling.\nAvoid going to places you know you might run into them. Stay away from the bars and coffee shops they frequent, even if it means changing your usual routine. Don’t walk home using the route that goes right by their house.",
                "Ignore flirtation or mixed signals. Your ex may reach out to you, even if you’ve explicitly asked them not to. They may even send flirtatious messages or indicate that they’re still interested in you. Do not respond to this. It’s disrespectful of the boundaries you’ve established and to your healing process.[6]\n\nYour ex may use flirtation as a way to manipulate you to reestablish contact. Unless they have explicitly said that they want try to get back together on terms that you could agree to, do not respond to their messages.\nIf you're afraid that your ex might stalk, harass, or threaten you, seek support from a domestic violence shelter. You also may want to contact law enforcement or file a restraining order.\nRemember that “friends with benefits” has the word “friends” in it.",
                "Unfollow them on social media. Seeing their latest posts will only bring up old feelings and remind you of your ex’s existence. You may need to unfollow them, or even block them, if necessary.\n\n[7]\nEven if you think that seeing them on social media is no big deal, consider how you’ll feel if they begin posting photos of them with their new date.\nSome people find it useful to get off of social media completely following a breakup. You may choose to do a “social media fast” for a week, a month, or more. This can help you focus on your own life and accomplishments without worrying about seeing pictures or mentions of your ex.",
                "Reconnect with yourself. Now that the relationship is over, you likely have more time to do things that you enjoy on your own or with friends. Get back to hobbies that you haven’t had time for recently. Call up a friend you haven’t seen in a while and do something fun together.[8]\n\nExercise, time outdoors, and time spent doing something you love are great ways to reconnect with yourself. It can feel lonely at first to spend time by yourself, but it’s important to get back to feeling good being on your own.\nSpend time with loved ones and close friends. When we spend time with people who care about us, it helps us reconnect with who we are separate from a previous relationship.",
                "Begin dating again. This might take a long time, depending on how long and how serious the relationship was. Make sure to wait until you’re really ready, but when you are, it’s good to take steps toward finding a new relationship that’s right for you.\n\n\nOnline dating apps can help you find other people who are looking for something similar. For example, if your last relationship was a long and serious one, you may just be looking for short-term, casual dating right now. Many apps can help you find others looking for that, too.\nIf your last relationship ended because you were looking for marriage and a family and your partner wasn’t ready, online apps can help you identify other people who are also looking for something serious.\nBe honest with people you date about what you’re going through. You don’t need to burden them with too much information, but you can say something like, “I got out of a serious relationship fairly recently. I’m still doing some processing about that, but I’m also really excited to be dating again.”"

        "wikiHow to Start a Yeast Free Diet": {
            "intro": "A yeast-free diet is one method that's been suggested to combat symptoms caused by Candida yeast infections. Not everyone agrees that it is effective, but anecdotally at least, many people stand by the results, so you may want to try it. The theory is that the natural balance of yeast within a person's system is thrown off by an overgrowth, so taking out yeast-containing foods for about six weeks can restore the proper balance and quiet the infection. People who are prone to yeast infections regularly may find it useful to reduce the amount of yeast in their diet overall.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider your symptoms. A yeast infection most commonly occurs as itching, burning and white patches either in the oral or genital area. However, some people have experienced further symptoms, including depression, headaches, fatigue, stomach pain, and indigestion.\n\nCommon, recurrent oral or genital yeast infections may be a sign of a more general yeast sensitivity. While the infection can be treated with a prescription, it is worth considering an underlying cause.\nSome yeast infections will not respond well to prescriptions and you may find trying a yeast-free diet useful just to regain the a balance that has been thrown off. Since it is not a high-risk endeavor, trying a yeast-free diet is a popular method for people suffering from persistent infections.",
                "Consult your GP. You should check with your doctor to be diagnosed, as many of the symptoms suggested are general and can be due to multiple causes. Candida yeast overgrowth can often be measured, but even that may not be certain, and diagnosis by symptoms alone is disappointingly speculative.\n\n\nIf it is believed to be a yeast infection, you can get a prescription for antifungal medication (preferably a six week course) which you can take while on this diet as it will help kill the yeast infection. Appropriate antifungals include: Diflucan (Fluconazole), Lamisil (Terbinafine HCL), Nystatin, Sporanox\nMany traditional practitioners are unconvinced [1] that yeast-free diets are medically useful, so don't be surprised if your GP is not interested in what you choose to eat. Diet changes are difficult to measure (and could depend on individuals) so evidence may be limited for practical reasons, but nonetheless, not much exists.",
                "Prepare to change your diet. Whether you are imagining this to be simply for the next month and a half, or possibly for the foreseeable future, changing your diet can be a big undertaking if you aren't mentally prepared. Any time an elimination diet is starting, it is important to know all parameters of the diet and to be fully prepared. This is the number one key to success. Try to prepare yourself in advance, and find supportive people.\n\n\nRemember that the first few days are likely to be the worst as your body transitions to a new diet. With a yeast-free diet, the physical balance in your body is thrown off even further before it rights itself, like trying to a right a boat in a rocky ocean.\nDon't reward yourself with ways to cheat on the diet — instead, reward yourself with things that you love in other contexts, like being allowed to spend money or waste time on something you enjoy. Like other elimination-type diets, even the smallest \"cheat\" can cause a relapse of symptoms.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the foods that are off-limits. While you don't want to concentrate on the negative in a diet, it is important to know the boundaries as you adapt to a new set of habits.\n\n\nStay away from anything that contains yeast, like most breads, processed foods, and baked goods.\nSugar in any form (this included sucrose, glucose and fructose) is also a danger as yeast feeds and grows on sugar.\nRefined grains, malted products, and fermented products (vinegar, soy, ginger, beer and wine), including all alcohol, either contain yeast or quick-acting carbohydrates which feed the growth of yeast.\nDairy products should be avoided, as with most cheese. The primary exception in this category is yogurt with living cultures.\nAny mushroom or fungus is out.\nIt is recommended that you avoid stimulants like coffee, chocolate, black tea and so forth, as they release stored sugar into the body and so provide a breeding ground for yeast. The same applies for artificial sweeteners and spicy foods.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the foods that you can eat. Much easier than creating a list of foods you can't eat, is to create a list of foods that you can eat and stick to those. Find ways to make these foods interesting and broaden your horizons if any of these foods are ones you have yet to try. Essentially you are aiming for a diet of fresh greens and fresh proteins, with limited fresh fruits and dairy (as they are higher in sugars), and complex grains. But get to know the details so that you can make foods you enjoy! Things you can eat include:\n\n\nFresh meat, chicken and fish.\nEggs.\nGarbanzo beans and lentils.\nAvocado.\nWalnuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, and coconut.\nBrown rice (no white rice) and rice cakes.\nAll vegetables, fresh or frozen, including onions and garlic.\nFruit that is not bruised (but no melons or grapes).\nLimited milk (125ml per day) or soya / rice milk.\nPlain yoghurt with active cultures.\nLow fat cottage cheese with no sugar.\nHomemade popcorn.\nPlain chips with no MSG.\nHerbal teas.",
                "Familiarize yourself with treats. These are foods allowed weekly (only one item of each), that won't throw off your balance entirely in one serving, but will disrupt things if they become habitual. Foods like these include:[2]\n\nWhole wheat pasta.\nTomato paste.\nCheeses such as Camembert or feta.\nTinned tuna in spring water (as opposed to fresh tuna, which is regularly acceptable).\nSpices.",
                "Continue this diet for four to six weeks. At the end of this period, the system infection should be gone, and all the symptoms relieved. If you are not feeling fit and healthy after committing to the diet for this period, then a yeast infection may not be the underlying cause of your symptoms as that should be long enough for your body to retain balance\n\n\nAnd, as with any allergy, removing the culprit from your diet for a set period is a perfect way to test for a sensitivity. The trouble can be that while some allergies have very clear, obvious reactions like a skin rash or asthma attack, you may consider the symptoms of a yeast sensitivity difficult to be sure about. It's important to remember to trust what you feel.",
                "Slowly add foods back into your diet over a period of a few weeks. If your infection has cleared up and you would like to start eating certain foods again, it is safe to do so slowly without triggering the same infection.\n\n\nHowever, if you are sensitive to yeast infections in general your system will still react to a high level of yeast or yeast-generating environments. Therefore, it is sensible to add foods back slowly and be aware of any negative reactions. This way, you can determine whether it is a sensitivity to yeast or to something else you happened to stop eating.\nYou may find that you feel better on a yeast-free diet for the long-term, as some systems are prone to yeast imbalance. You can try it and see!",
                "Change your attitude. The primary thing to keep in mind is that you will be focusing on eating completely fresh foods — nothing fermented, nothing baked, nothing fungal, and nothing that is likely to have attracted any growths. While there is more to it than that, this overall mental attitude can help you make decisions when you come across a new food. Don't have an \"I can't have that\" attitude; have an \"I choose not to have that\" attitude!\n\n\nThink of your food not as a treat for your mouth but fuel for your entire body, and choose things that will be pleasing for every part of a healthy you. Mentally associate positive health and feeling good with the foods that are beneficial, and remember the consequences of the foods that are off-limits.",
                "Remove yeast from your diet. If you think a yeast-free diet may be more healthy for your body type overall, try working toward taking yeast out of your diet for good. Rather than thinking about specific foods that are or aren't allowed, imagine creating a diet that will serve your body most effectively.\n\n\nGluten-free diets have become more popular among a wide range of people, but it has been suggested that some of those cases may actually be yeast allergies, since the two show up in many of the same places. If you have tried a gluten free diet that works some of the time but not always, it may be worth investigating where the two differ.",
                "Partner up with a friend. Mutual support is a great way to keep a project in the air, and a healthy diet will benefit anyone. Even if you are not eating exactly the same food, congratulating one another and reminding each other what's off limits is more useful than you might think. It can keep you motivated and help you hold yourself accountable.\n\n\nPlanning meals in advance can keep your momentum going. Two people are better than one since there will be back-up if either of you starts to fall off the wagon, and preparing food will be a motivating force.\nEating together is a positive social interaction. Certainly not everyone will have the time to spend every meal together, but even checking in on a regular basis will make a difference. Whether it's dinner every day with a spouse or lunch once a week with a co-worker, any form of patting each other on the back is a plus.",
                "Talk to a nutritionist. If you are serious about changing your relationship to food, it is worth planning meals that you like and that are good for you. A professional can help you determine the best combination to meet your needs.\n\n\nEach individual will find a different arrangement of meals that works best, so talking to someone can be a useful method to make starting a new diet a good experience, rather than stressful or frustrating. Remember, eating food that is good for your body should ultimately be pleasing. It may take a period of adjustment, but don't expect to suffer endlessly. A nutritionist can help figure out what you need to be satisfied.",
                "Create breakfast that you will eat. Some people think of breakfast as something they grab as they run out the door, while others believe it is the most important meal of the day, and has to have enough calories to get the day started. Recognize your own tendencies and interests, and make meals that are right for you.Consider these options when making Breakfast:\n\n\nOne piece of fruit.\nPorridge – oats or rice cereal.\nYeast-free bread or rice cakes.\nEgg with avocado and tomato.\nCottage cheese.",
                "Create lunch and dinner that you'll enjoy! Do you need to bring food with you to work? Are you cooking for two (or more) at home? Some people like to eat small amounts and just snack a lot, while others want to have a nice big plate of food at dusk. Get to know what you really want to eat. Consider these options for lunch or dinner:\n\n\nLentil soup.\nAny meat with plenty of vegetables.\nVegetable stir fry with brown rice.\nCold chicken with cottage cheese.\nPotato salad.\nHummus sandwich on pita bread.\nAvocado sandwich on sourdough bread.",
                "Write down ideas you come across so that you can start building up your own collection of options. You will start to use certain ideas regularly, and have a selection of go-to dishes, as everyone tends to on any diet (one they are watching or not), but it is always worth keeping a few possibilities nearby to mix things up now and then.\n\n\nYou can do a search for yeast-free meals to look for new recipes, as there are always new ideas being posted and talked about online. Sometimes you will simply be reminded of ingredients you haven't thought to use in a long time - and the same stir-fry can be a whole different meal whether you center it around bok-choy and carrots or brussels sprouts and kale.\nYou can also just look up a few of your favorite ingredients, and modify the results a little if it's necessary. Remember that you can usually replace regular milk with soy milk, or vinegar with lemon juice, so long as the recipe is simple."

        "wikiHow to Travel Cheaply in America": {
            "intro": "The United States of America is an enormous country. Just the state of Texas alone is larger than the entire country of France. Therefore, traveling cheaply around Europe tends to be a lot easier than traveling cheaply around the USA. However, that's not to say there are no inexpensive ways to travel around America (or at least, less expensive). With a little bit of luck and a lot of research, you can easily plan a sightseeing trip through America without breaking the bank.",
            "steps": [
                "Make a budget. Decide what you're willing to spend on travel/food/etc. Try not to go over this amount arbitrarily once you've made up your mind.",
                "Decide whether you have a destination in mind or not. While most travelers have a specific place they want to go or a specific sight they want to see, being flexible can save you a lot of money. For instance, many bus and airplane companies run deals on high-traffic routes (such as New York to Boston). Check and see whether the city nearest to you hosts any of these routes.",
                "Make a list of all the cities and sights you hope to visit. Plan how much time you'll want to spend in each city, and allow time for travel in between cities if you're making a multi-stage trip. Remember to give yourself an extra day or so in each location if you can manage it, allowing you to relax and enjoy the trip instead of stressing about the next item on your list.",
                "Look up how much money the attractions you want to see cost. Try to research whether they ever have free admission. Many museums, for instance, provide free entry one day per month. For expensive sights, look and see if the company provides deals online. Finally, look into whether you qualify for any help from organizations or groups you belong to, such as AAA or senior citizen discounts.",
                "Map out your trip. Don't travel from Los Angeles to New York and then back to Oregon unless you find some incredible deals. Instead, try to hit each stop along the way to the next one.",
                "Choose your transportation option wisely. Depending on how many stops you plan to make, how long your trip is, and where you're going, you may have better luck with one method of transportation than others.\n\n\nBuses and trains are exciting and unique ways to see America and often cost less than planes and cars if you book far enough in advance. Not only do you save money, but you get to see the countryside roll peacefully by out the window. Also, you can leave your phone on, and many buses and trains now come with outlets at every seat.\nCars are nice because they allow freedom, both in and out of the cities. You don't have to worry about transportation schedules, and you'll easily reach each destination. However, you also might be stuck driving long distances, you could get lost, and you're responsible for all gas expenses. Also, if you plan on making a one-way trip, the car drop-off fee can be exorbitant.\nPlanes can quickly cover long distances, but are also often expensive and inflexible. It also means that upon arrival you may be paying additional transportation fees, since you'll probably have to rent a car or use public transportation around your destination city.\nIf you must fly, try to find out whether your nearest airport serves as an airline fortress hub or not. Fortress hubs are airports where a certain airline has a near-monopoly, allowing them to raise ticket prices out of that airport. Avoid flying out of these airports if you're hoping to save money. Additionally, pack light to avoid extra baggage fees.",
                "Research options for lodging. You don't have to stay in a five-star hotel to have an amazing trip. There are tons of other, more budget-friendly options.\n\n\nThink about couch surfing, where kind-hearted homeowners allow travelers to sleep on their guest beds or couches—often at no cost.\nIf sleeping on a couch sounds like the wrong type of adventure, look into hostels. Most major cities have at least one, and rates are much cheaper than hotels. However, you'll probably be sleeping on a cheap bed (or bunk bed) and sharing a room.\nIf your budget is a bit higher, you can always stay in a motel or hotel. Use budget travel sites to find cheap rates. Inexpensive hotels aren't always the best quality, so make sure to read reviews also before making a reservation!",
                "Book early. Don't wait until the last minute to plan any aspect of your trip. While you can occasionally find a great deal by postponing your reservations, the risk isn't really worth it. You'll get cheaper prices by booking months in advance of your trip. Most hotels and transportation companies provide early bird discounts, sometimes to the extent of cutting your rate in half. Early, early, early is the motto of the budget adventurer.",
                "Stick to your initial budget. While splurging is okay once in a while (after all, no trip plan is perfect), remember that this is supposed to be cheap travel. Don't let yourself run up a huge bill that you can't afford.",
                "Be careful where you eat. People who live in Manhattan rarely eat in Times Square, because there are much better restaurants in the city for far cheaper. Try using a crowd-sourcing website or mobile application to find inexpensive but delicious eateries at your destination. Take a chance on that small Mexican restaurant with great reviews. It might end up being your new favorite meal.",
                "Live like a native. Don't act like a tourist, and you won't be treated like one. In addition to eating at places where people who live in the city would eat, thus avoiding overpriced tourist traps, this advice should be rule number one on your trip. While you may not notice all the money you're saving by not acting like a helpless tourist, you'd certainly notice the money you lost if you didn't follow this rule.\n\n\nUnscrupulous businesses often raise prices on people they know are tourists.\nTourists are also easy marks for all sorts of shady “businesses,” such as the people who will show you to the correct train platform for a sizable “tip.”"

        "How to Be a Great Auntie": {
            "intro": "Becoming an auntie to a child, whether by blood or by choice, is an exciting experience. As an aunt, you are involved in your niece or nephew’s life, engaging them, loving them, and acting as a role model for them. While the prospect of caring for and being involved in a child’s life might seem daunting to a first time aunt, you will quickly find that it is easy and fun to build a great relationship with your niece or nephew.",
            "steps": [
                "Listen to them. Sometimes parents are too busy to listen to their children, especially if they have multiple children and busy careers. In situations such as these, as an auntie you can give more time to all the stories and news that your nieces and nephews want to share. In this way, you are almost acting as a supplemental parent by offering your niece or nephew your attention when they need it.[1]\n\nPractice active listening with your nieces and nephews. Listen to closely to what they are saying to you, and then repeat it back to them in their own words to make sure that you understood what they told you.[2] Now, your niece or nephew will either confirm that you understood what they said, or they will correct you and explain what they meant. This helps to avoid misunderstandings.[3]",
                "Act as a role model. In addition to listening to your niece or nephew, you can offer them advice, teach them how to do things, and set a good example for them.[4] This will allow you to help mold your niece or nephew’s behaviors through your own example or counsel. For example, you might offer advice on how your niece or nephew should treat their siblings or how they should maintain a relationship with their parents.\n\n[5] Or you might offer relationship advice or counsel your niece or nephew on school or career paths as they get older.[6]\nIf you do not believe that you would be a good role model for your nieces and nephews, ask yourself why not. Is this something that you can change about yourself? If so, consider making the change. If not, consider the impact this will have on the children. Ask yourself if this is something that you could hide from your nieces and nephews, if you cannot change it. If so, consider hiding it.\nFor example, perhaps you are a young adult and you like to drink alcohol with your friends in the evening. You know that drinking alcohol in excess in front of your nieces and nephews could have a lasting negative impact upon them and that it wouldn’t make you a good role model. You might decide to stop drinking so much in order to be a better role model for the children. Or you might decide to continue drinking with your friends, but choose to remain sober when you are around your nieces and nephews. If you feel like you need to get drunk around your nieces and nephews, return them to their parents immediately. Getting drunk in front of them is irresponsible, and sets a bad example for them.",
                "Be available to your niece and nephew. Babysit your nieces and nephews when they are young. As they get older, let them know that they can drop by to see you whenever they wish. Take them on outings with you or arrange scheduled visits with them.[7] The more time that you spend together, the stronger your bond will become. You will also show them that you are dependable and that they can trust you by making time for them.",
                "Spend time cultivating your relationship with them through phone calls, text messages, and emails.[8] This is especially important if you can't visit with your niece or nephew or if you live far away. By incorporating mediated communication into your relationship with your niece or nephew, you are teaching them that you are always available to them and that you can be reached in a multitude of ways.[9]",
                "Share stories with your nieces and nephews. If you know that your niece or nephew is going through something that you experienced as a child, share the story of your experience with your niece or nephew.\n\n[10] Children like hearing stories, especially when they are relatable or if they contain stories that include people they know such as their parents, grandparents, or other aunts and uncles. These stories inform your nieces and nephews of their family history, while also letting them know that they are not alone in their experiences.",
                "Remain on good terms with your siblings. Your brother or sister is likely the parent of your nieces and nephews, and you want to make sure that you don’t go against their wishes when you are spending time with your nieces and nephews. Your relationship with your nieces and nephews depends upon the strength of your relationship with their parents. The closer you are with their parents, the more likely that you will be close with your nieces and nephews.[11]\n\nAs an aunt, you also want to make sure that you back up your siblings in the values, lessons, and rules that they are imposing upon their children.[12] Respecting your siblings, shows your nieces and nephews that they should respect their parents and the family unit as a whole.",
                "Choose activities that your niece or nephew enjoys. When in doubt, ask them what they like to do. By undertaking an activity that they like, you will be able to hold their interest and demonstrate a common bond with them.",
                "Teach them how to do something that you enjoy. If you have a talent or a special skill, go out of your way to teach your niece or nephew how to do what you do.[13][14] This will create a stronger bond between you and your niece or nephew and this activity may become something that they only do with you. For example:\n\n\nIf you are good at baking cookies, perhaps you can teach them how to make your recipes and you can bake cookies together.\nIf you are a musician, perhaps you can teach them to play music with you.\nIf you play a soccer, you might teach your niece or nephew how to kick the soccer ball around the field with you, or instruct them on the rules of the game.",
                "Take your nieces and nephews to interesting places. By taking them to a place that you find fun or interesting, you’ll impart your interests on them. These places might include planetariums, museums, parks, zoos, aquariums, beaches, etc. These trips can be educational, informative, and fun.",
                "Make staying in fun. Sometimes staying in can be more fun than going out with your niece or nephew. You can giggle and dance in the living room.[15] You can build a blanket fort and watch movies or read books together all afternoon. Doing an activity together doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to leave the house or spend a lot of money. Below are a list of other activities that can make staying in fun:\n\n\nBring along something from work and do a show-and-tell.\nWork on a science experiment together.\nBake a dessert together.\nGo through an old photo album filled with images of you and their parents.\nDo an art project together.",
                "Buy them gifts. [16] While it makes sense to buy gifts for the child’s birthdays and winter holidays, sometimes it is fun to surprise your niece or nephew with a gift at random. Sometimes these gifts will be impractical items that are adorable or funny, and other times your gift may be a toy that you know the child has been yearning for.[17] Regardless of what you gift the child, the look of excitement and happiness on their face is always worth the expense.",
                "Take them out for dessert. As an auntie, you can spoil your niece and nephew with desserts when they spend time with you. This is a particular treat for the child if your visits are infrequent or if their parents do not often give them desserts. Taking a child out for ice cream with rainbow sprinkles is a great way to spoil them and bond with them at the same time.[18]",
                "Take them to do something special. An easy way to spoil your niece or nephew is to take them to do something significant once or twice a year. For example, you might take them to a baseball game if your niece or nephew is a sports fan, to a dinner theatre musical if they are a fan of theatre, or to see The Nutcracker if they are a fan of dance. While these events may range in price from free to pricey, this is a special treat and time spent with you that they will treasure.",
                "Maintain boundaries. While spoiling your nieces and nephews is fun, you want to make sure that you aren’t doing anything that will have negative consequences for you or for them. For example, you might let your five year old niece stay up an hour beyond her bedtime to finish watching a movie with you, but you don’t want to let her stay up until midnight. Likewise, you might like to take your teenage nephew out for dinner and a ball game, but you shouldn’t be giving him beers while he is in your care."

        "How to Meditate to Get to Sleep": {
            "intro": "We all know that getting enough sleep is extremely important to both our mental and physical health, but sometimes falling asleep can be a real challenge! Meditation is a great way to help get those ZZZ's your body needs. There are many different styles of meditation that work to promote sleep, and studies have shown that they are all quite effective. [1] This article will teach you a few different meditation techniques that are proven to help people fall sleep. Try one or try them all, and find the method that works best for you!",
            "steps": [
                "Understand guided meditation. In guided meditation, you listen to an audio track of a person reading meditation instructions to you, and simply follow along with your thoughts. This is an excellent introduction to meditation for those who have never done it before and don't know where to start.",
                "Find a guided meditation track for sleeping. There are many free guided meditations for sleep available on the internet as downloadable audio files, podcasts, and YouTube videos. You can also purchase sleep meditation CDs at any major bookstore, or online.\n\n\nLook for a guided meditation CD or file that has good reviews, or comes from a reputable source, such as MIT Medical, which provides a number of audio file downloads designed to help you fall asleep. [2]\n\nIf you download a free file, it is a good idea to listen to it once before bedtime to make sure the file is intact and doesn't include any hidden surprises, like advertisements at the end.",
                "Prepare your audio setup. Get ready to sleep, and set up the device you will be using to play the guided meditation next to your bed. Adjust the volume settings beforehand.\n\n\nBe sure to set the device's sleep mode or power saver settings so that the device will turn itself off after the recording has finished.\nIt is not advisable to use headphones for a guided sleep meditation, since ideally you will fall asleep before the recording is over, and you don't want to get tangled up in the cords in the night.",
                "Get ready and start the recording. Put on your pajamas, darken the room, and get comfy in bed before you hit play. Then relax and listen, and prepare for a night of restful sleep! If you don't fall asleep after the first play-through, take a few deep breaths and begin again.",
                "Understand progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is a meditation technique in which you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in your body to promote awareness of your body, and an allover state of relaxation. Progressive relaxation can be used day or night for general relaxation, but is especially helpful for promoting sleep at night. Performing the full progressive relaxation exercise should take between 10 to 15 minutes.",
                "Get comfortable. Put on your pajamas and ready for bed. Darken your room, lie down, and adjust your pillows and blankets until you are fully comfortable.",
                "Close your eyes and begin to relax. Take a few deep breaths, and quiet your mind. Begin focusing on your body, and tell yourself that it's OK to relax.[3]",
                "Tense and relax your muscles. Begin at the top of your head, and work your way down in the order described. Tense the muscles just enough to feel the tension, not so much that you feel pain. After five seconds of tension, relax the muscles you are working on. (Some people find it helpful to think or quietly say the word \"relax\" for this part.) After 10 seconds of relaxation, move on to the next muscle group, and repeat the process.\n\n\nForehead. Wrinkle your brow or raise your eyebrows up like you are surprised, then relax.\nEyes and nose. Close your eyes tightly in a squint, then relax.\nMouth, cheeks and jaw. Stretch your mouth open, as in a yawn, or make a wide grimace, then relax.\nHands. Clench your fists, then release them and relax.\nWrists and forearms. Hold your hands up like you are pushing an invisible wall and tense, then relax.\nUpper arms. Flex your biceps, then relax.\nShoulders. Raise your shoulders towards your ears in a shrug, then relax.\nBack. Arch your back gently, then relax.\nStomach. Tighten your stomach muscles like you are \"sucking it in,\" then relax.\nHips and glutes. Flex your glutes, then relax.\nThighs. Tense your thigh muscles above the knees, then relax.\nAnkles and feet. Flex your feet, raising your toes as high as you can, then relax.\nToes. Curl your toes as tightly as you can, then relax.",
                "Return to any muscles that are still tense. Repeat the process of tensing and relaxing 3 to 4 times on any muscles that still feel tight or tense.",
                "Enjoy the feeling of relaxation, and let yourself drift off to sleep. If you still feel tense, or are not quite asleep, repeat the process once more, beginning at the top of your head, and progressively working back down to your toes.",
                "Understand mindfulness meditation. During mindfulness meditation, you will pay focused and intentional attention to the way you are feeling, in order to relax the body and mind. [4] It is important not to judge or analyze the thoughts and feelings that pop into your head while performing mindfulness meditation, just note them and let them go by. The center of your focus should be the physical sensations you are experiencing in the present moment, as you lie in bed.[5]",
                "Lie down and get comfortable. Get ready for bed, darken your room, and prepare to go to sleep.[6]",
                "Breathe. Begin your meditation by taking 5 long breaths, in through your nose, and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of breathing, as your chest expands and your lungs fill with air. As you breathe out, imagine exhaling the events and thoughts of the day along with the air.",
                "Check in with your feelings. Take a moment to reflect on how your body and mind are feeling. Take your time with this step and don't become concerned by the flood of thoughts that may occur, just take a few moments to observe them and let them rush by.\n\n\nThis is not the time to try to solve problems. If you feel yourself worrying about something, just observe the concern and move on. You can try to work out solutions to issues the next day, when you are well-rested and refreshed.",
                "Focus your on attention on your physical body. Begin by concentrating on the points of contact between your body and the bed. Is your weight equally distributed? Think about how your head is resting on your pillow, and how the blankets lie against your feet. Listen to any sounds you can hear, including your own breath. Observe the temperature of the room, and the way the air is circulating around your face.",
                "Think about how your body feels. Does it feel light or heavy? Are you experiencing any tension or pain? Mentally scan your body from head to toe, thinking about areas of tension, and intentionally tensing and then relaxing them, as you might do in a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Repeat the body scan process several times, if needed, to relax any tense muscles.",
                "Focus again on your breathing. Pay attention to the rhythm as you inhale and exhale. Focus on the physical sensations of breathing, and the sounds that your breath makes. If your mind starts to wander, return to the focus of the rising and falling of your chest.",
                "Review the events of the day in a structured fashion. Take a few minutes to remember and relive the way your day unfolded, from the moment you got up in the morning, to the present moment. Fast-forward through the day, observe and recollect conversations and what you did, but don't analyze or overthink.",
                "Return your focus to your body. Once your review of the day has caught up with the present, where you are lying in bed, return to the sensations of your body and your breath.",
                "Switch off your body. Beginning with the toes of your left foot, think about each part of your body for a moment, and give it permission to \"switch off\" or \"go to sleep.\" Travel from your toes, up your leg, to your waist, then repeat with the other leg. Then continue to check-in with your torso, and each arm, beginning with your finger, and working your way up to your shoulders and neck. Finish with your throat, face and head.",
                "Enjoy the feeling of relaxation, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep. With your body at rest, your mind will soon follow. Allow your thoughts to wander as they will, knowing you will wake up feeling refreshed and relaxed.\n\n\nMany people fall asleep long before this last step. If you have not, don't worry. Just remember that your body wants to sleep as much as you do, and that it will eventually happen. Just relax and try not to force it."

            "intro": "If you are hoping to place a call to Vietnam from the United States but don't know how, you've come to the right place. Follow the steps in this article to learn how to place your call to Vietnam.",
            "steps": [
                "Find the United States’ international exit code. Every country has an exit code that needs to be dialed when trying to make a call to a different country. The exit code for the United States is 011.[1]",
                "Find the calling code for Vietnam. In order to be connected to the country you are trying to call, you will need to find its country code. The country code for Vietnam is 84.[2]",
                "Find the area code for the region you are calling in Vietnam. Area codes in Vietnam can be one to three digits long. For example, Ho Chi Minh City's area code is 8, while Hung Yen is 321.",
                "Know the local phone number you are trying to reach. This is the number of the business, person, or cell phone you are trying to contact. The land lines in Vietnam are generally 7 digits long. Thus, you would dial, 011-84-(area code)-XXX-XXXX.\n\n\nIf you are trying to reach a mobile phone number, you will have to dial a special cell phone number after you dial the country code, followed by the 7 digit cell phone number. These special numbers are based on the cell phone carrier the person is using. The numbers can be[3]: 91(Vinaphone,) 90 (MobiFone,) 98 (Viettel,) 95 (S-phone,) or 96 (EVN-Telecom.)",
                "Know what time is it in Vietnam. Vietnam is 15 hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time (the west coast of the United States.) Vietnam is in the Indochina time zone. It is important to keep in mind the difference in time zones because it would be rude to call someone at 3 AM. It will also cost you money, as you may be charged for placing an international call even if the person you are trying to reach doesn’t pick up.[4]",
                "Place your call by dialing the full international number. To demonstrate, let us say that you are trying to place a call from San Francisco, CA to Ho Chi Minh City. You would dial:\n\n\n011 (the US exit code.)\n84 (Vietnam’s country code.)\n8 (Ho Chi Minh City's area code.)\nXXX-XXXX (the local number.)",
                "Consider buying an international calling card. Prepaid phone cards are available online or at many local stores, and make calling Vietnam much easier. A phone card can help you keep track of exactly how much your phone call is costing, without the nasty shock of a huge phone bill later.\n\n\nServices like Yahoo Messenger (popular in VN) or Gmail will allow you to talk for free but the other person in VN must be online and using that service at the same time for it to work. Both parties need a headset/mic or something built-in the computer to listen/talk.\nWhen choosing a phone card to call Vietnam, check to see how increments are billed. Some phone cards round up to the next minute, while others can round up to every 3 minutes, making the cost of a 4 minute call and a 6 minute call the same."

        "How to Get into College": {
            "intro": "Every year during college application season, we read new articles about plummeting acceptances rates at top schools. And every year, we read about the resulting pressure on high school students to put their most accomplished, interesting, and polished foot forward in applications. Approached haphazardly, the college admissions process can be overwhelming-- and yes, getting into college takes work. But with the right planning, you can minimize stress while giving you a better chance at being accepted to a fantastic school.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the criteria that colleges will use to evaluate you. Most colleges use a \"holistic\" admissions process, meaning that the school will consider your achievement in many areas-- both objective and subjective. A weakness in one area can be outweighed by a strength in another, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nYour academic record. Colleges will see this quantitatively in the form of your four-year transcript and GPA, as well as qualitatively in your teachers' and counselor's recommendation comments. Admissions officers want to see that you can succeed in an academically challenging environment.\n\nYour standardized test scores. Most colleges, particularly the more selective ones, require the ACT or SAT.\n\nYour extracurriculars. Colleges seek students who are engaged outside of the classroom. Participating in a breadth of activities can indicate that you are a well-rounded person, but colleges also seek depth of engagement, which you can indicate through pursuing leadership positions or independent projects.\n\nYour character. Essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews all combine to convey your personality.\n\nYour background. Colleges evaluate your achievements in the context of your circumstances-- for example, admissions officers will not expect you to have taken eight AP courses if your school offers none. Similarly, background can illuminate character, and colleges will be impressed by an applicant who excels despite personal hardship.\n\nYour \"fit\" with a particular college. The word \"fit\" can seem maddeningly nebulous: what exactly does it mean to be a good match for a certain school? But admissions officers want students who understand and appreciate the culture and unique offerings of the colleges to which they apply.",
                "Choose your classes carefully throughout high school. Take classes that will challenge you, but don't overload yourself; remember that you don't want to get an ulcer while you are still a teenager!\n\n\nTake AP courses. AP exams not only demonstrate a willingness to challenge yourself, but also can give you college credits that may save you time and tuition later.\nFulfill the coursework recommendations of colleges you are interested in. Most four-year colleges want applicants to have taken four years of each main academic subject, including foreign language. Treat suggestions as requirements: for example, if one of your prospective colleges requires three years of high school science but suggests four, you should take four years of science to remain competitive.\nOnly take less than four years of a subject in order to take more advanced courses in an area you are especially interested in.",
                "Pay attention to your GPA. You don't need a 4.0 to get into a great school, but remember that your cumulative GPA for all four years of high school is sometimes used as an initial screen for colleges that receive a plethora of applications. Higher grades will expand your colleges choices.",
                "Distinguish yourself in activities outside of school. As a freshman, you may want to try out many different activities. But as you get older, it is best to focus your time on a few activities that you find most rewarding and pursue leadership positions in them. Colleges will note your commitment.\n\n\nUse your summers productively. Find an internship; volunteer; get a job; attend a summer program or take courses at a community college; work on a personal project; reach out to a professor at your local college whose research interests you and ask if you can get involved.\nEnter contests. Awards will help your application stand out, and even if you don't win, the experience can't hurt.",
                "Make a resume. Keep track of your activities and the dates you participated in them so you don't forget anything when filling out your applications.",
                "Get to know your teachers. Reach out to them after class to ask questions or discuss topics of interest. You'll thank yourself later when it's time to ask them for a recommendation!",
                "Take the SAT or ACT. Sign up for a test in winter or spring of your junior year, and that way, if you are unhappy with your scores, you'll have plenty of time to study and take the test again.\n\n\nTake the PSAT in October of your junior year if your high school offers it. This will help you learn what to expect on the actual exam, and if you do well enough, you may receive a financial award from the National Merit scholarship competition (free money!).\nGet a test prep book at least a month before your test and work through it. Focus on areas of difficulty, and take multiple full practice tests.\nUse the practice questions posted on the SAT and ACT websites. The SAT, for example, provides a regular Question of the Day.\nConsider enrolling in a test prep class. But if test prep is too costly, remember that that it is completely possible improve your scores through independent studying.",
                "Take SAT Subject Tests. Unlike the SAT and ACT, these exams test knowledge of a specific topic such as Biology or U.S. History. Most selective colleges require you to submit scores for two different Subject Tests.\n\n\nTake tests in areas you have excelled in.\nTake the a Subject Test immediately after finishing the relevant coursework at your school. For example, if you take Biology your freshman year and do well in it, you should take the Biology Subject Test that spring while the concepts remain fresh in your mind.\nIf you are considering a career in a STEM field and have taken some trigonometry and precalculus, you should strongly consider taking the Math 2 Subject Test. Many colleges will prefer math proficiency beyond the scope of the general SAT.",
                "Do basic research. Get a college guide book from the bookstore or library; subscribe to college mailing lists by filling our their Information Request forms online; dig around college websites, paying particular attention to the programs and majors that you are interested in; attend information sessions in your hometown.",
                "Visit schools in person if possible. Even with extensive research, it can be difficult to get a true \"feel\" for a college without spending time on campus. When you visit, sign up to attend a campus tour or information session-- or both. Campus tours are often student-led, while information sessions are typically led by admissions officers. Both will give you valuable knowledge.\n\n\nTake notes during or right after your visits. Without anything to refer back to, schools may begin to blend together in your head!\nPay attention to campus atmosphere. What are the students like? What are they doing as you walk around campus? Can you imagine yourself among them?\nSet aside time to explore the area surrounding campus. Find out what sort of activities, entertainment, and resources you could take advantage of as a student there.",
                "Assemble a balanced list. The admissions game is wildly unpredictable, and you will need to apply to schools that range widely in selectivity to ensure that, come spring, you have been accepted to at least one program. Your list should include schools from each of the following three categories:\n\n\n\nReach schools. These are colleges that you have only a small chance at being accepted to. Many college counselors will say that a college that accepts less than 15 percent of its applicants should always be considered a reach school, no matter how accomplished the student.\n\nTarget schools.These are colleges that you have a good shot at being accepted at. You fit the profile of their accepted students: for example, you fall within their average range of test scores and GPA.\n\nLikely or \"Safety\" schools.These are colleges you are very confident you will be accepted at.",
                "Consider cost-- but don't let sticker price discourage you. Talk with your family about how much you can afford to pay for college. But when creating your list, remember that most colleges are \"need-blind\" and will give you financial aid if you are accepted.\n\n\nSeek out the \"Price Calculator\" on college websites, and enter your family's financial information to find out how much aid you can expect to receive.",
                "Decide if you will submit an Early Application. Some of the colleges on your list may offer an \"Early Action\" or an \"Early Decision\" option, which allows students to submit their applications earlier in the fall and receive their admissions decision sooner, in December. Early Action is non-binding: you are not obligated to attend the college if accepted. In contrast, students accepted to a college through Early Decision must enroll there.\n\n\n\nIf you have a clear first choice college, apply Early Decision if possible. Early Decision increases your chances of getting in by demonstrating to a college that they are your first choice.\n\nIf you are unsure where you want to go, apply Early Action. Colleges generally have higher admissions rates for early applicants. Plus, hearing back earlier on will save you suspense-- and a favorable decision will put your mind at ease!",
                "Make a timeline. Personally check the website of each college on your list and note the most up-to-date admissions deadlines. If you are prone to procrastination, create mini-deadlines to encourage steady work: for example, you might plan to finish one new application each week.",
                "Create a Common App account, if you need to (hint, you probably do). More than 500 colleges currently accept this standardized application form. You only need to fill it out once, and once finished, you simply forward it to all participating schools you are applying to.\n\n\nThe app opens each year online on August 1st, so you can begin filling out your application over the summer (lucky you!).\nThe Common App requires a \"personal statement,\" a prompt-based essay of no more than 650 words. The prompts generally stay the same from year to year, so it's possible--and wise-- to start drafting your response even before August 1st arrives.\nA personal statement will help admissions officers get to know you through some important aspects, or aspects, of your identity. Although there is no one correct format, compelling essays often recount and reflect on a story.",
                "Ask your teachers for letters of recommendation. The vast majority of colleges require two teachers, both from core academic subjects: English, math, science, history, or foreign language. Ask early on in your senior year. Otherwise, your teacher of choice may be swamped with other requests by the time you reach them!\n\n\nChoose teachers who have a high opinion of you. Ideally, your recommender has seen you excel or work to overcome challenges. Did you enjoy their class? Did you put effort into it?\nChoose recommenders who have taught you in the past two years and for at least a semester: not your math teacher from all the way back in freshman year, and not the senior year math teacher you've only known for two weeks.\nIf you believe another adult-- an art teacher, a coach, a supervisor, and so on-- would write persuasively on your behalf, by all means ask them. But their letter should supplement your two academic letters rather than replace them.\nAsk for your letters in person. You may feel awkward, but your request will have a more personal touch.\nOffer to send your recommender your resume, to help them write knowledgeably about you.",
                "Write any necessary supplemental essays. Many colleges require essays specific to their school in addition to your personal statement. Like the personal statement, this is an opportunity to convey important parts of your identity in a compelling, readable way.",
                "Consider submitting an arts supplement. If you have devoted significant time to or demonstrated unusual achievement in visual art, music, dance, or writing, a portfolio can enhance your application. But beware!-- if you submit a portfolio, some colleges will require you to submit your entire application up to a month earlier.",
                "Revise and proofread your application before submitting. Ask parents, friends, or trusted teachers to read it over, but make sure the words and ideas in your application remain your own.",
                "Prepare for any interviews. Not all schools require or even offer interviews; generally, schools will contact you after you submit your application with interview instructions. An off-campus alumni interview is a good and convenient option, but if possible, arrange an on-campus interview with an admissions officer, as this will hold more weight in the admissions process.\n\n\n\nRelax. Your interview will probably not make or break you, unless you show up in torn jeans and a sweaty T-shirt and start swearing.\nResearch a college before going to its interview. Think about why you are applying to this specific school and what strengths you would contribute to it.\nHave questions ready for your interviewer. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn more about the school, as well as to convey your genuine interest in a school.\nLook on the internet for some common college interview questions[1], and practice your answers beforehand-- but avoid memorizing responses in a way that will sound mechanical.\nBrush up on some current events. You don't need to know everything that's going on in the world, but it's not a bad idea to read the newspaper daily for a few days before the interview.",
                "Finished. Smile because you've done what you can; now sit back, and wait."

        "wikiHow to Get a Sales Job With No Sales Experience": {
            "intro": "Sales jobs involve earning the interest of potential customers and then converting them to customers. Salespeople are needed in almost every trade and industry, and good salespeople often have the opportunity to earn high salaries. Many jobs require you to have a background in sales, but you can't build a background until you land your first job. Luckily, there are plenty of ways for prospective salespeople to break in.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn as much as you can about sales. You will have to impress your prospective employer with your knowledge and enthusiasm. Whether you're looking to become a telemarketer, a pharmaceutical salesperson, or a sales engineer, you will need some of the same basic know-how. Read books on sales, and read about sales strategies online. You will need to learn the practical psychology of selling, the strategies of getting a customer interested and of closing a deal.\n\n\nIf you know anyone in sales, offer to take them out to lunch so they can share their expertise with you.",
                "Compare material before you buy it. Check out the business and marketing section of your local bookstore or library, or read best-of lists in sales magazines online. Go for books and videos that deal in facts and data. Look for updated and tried and tested material, such as books that have been reissued and revised, or videos that are widely recommended.\n\n\nKeep track of what you read! You can mention authors you admire in your interview to let your prospective employer know that you have prepared.",
                "Narrow your options. Even when you've just entered the job market, it's not too early to specialize. Choose a product you are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about. For example, if your experience is in accounting, it is more practical to apply for a job selling investment plans than it is to apply for a job in pharmaceutical sales.[1] Choose a kind of product that interests you, and research the jobs available in that sector.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to get very specific. If you are interested in selling cars, focus on used cars, environmentally friendly cars, or luxury vehicles.\nWhether you are selling a product or a service, you must know enough about what you are selling that you could explain the benefits in a sentence or two.\nOnce you have chosen a product, look for resources specific to that field. Subscribe to a magazine for members of the industry, or check out back copies from your local public library.",
                "Take a class. Check out the sales courses available at your local community college. Many colleges offer classes in sales and marketing. If you are able to return to school, you could even enroll in a one-year certificate program in sales, or a two-year associates degree.\n\n\nSales representatives enter the workforce with a huge range of educational backgrounds. Job candidates with an undergraduate degree in business have an advantage, especially if they have a minor in sales. However, candidates without an undergraduate degree also stand a chance of being hired if they can make a sale.[2]\n\nSome fields require certification to enter. Learn the requirements for the job you want to have before you apply for jobs.",
                "Make a list of companies you would like to work for. Look up companies in the region where you would like to work in online business directories and telephone books. You will want to give them your resume even if they aren't currently hiring. Positions can open up unexpectedly. If they have your information on hand, they might give you a chance.",
                "Look for an entry-level position. Search online job boards for entry-level positions in your field of choice. Favor positions that offer training, as these companies will help you build your expertise. Remember, not all open positions are advertised. You will want to deliver your resume to companies that don't appear to be hiring, as well as those that do.\n\n\nCall your local temp agencies and ask about temporary sales positions.[3]\n\nConsider starting your sales career in retail. It can sometimes be easier to find entry-level positions in retail than in other fields.[4]\n\nConsider being an independent salesperson. Places such as cosmetic companies or travel agencies don't require any previous sales experience, and can help provide you with training and marketing materials.",
                "Find out who gets hired where. When you come across companies you would like to work for, try to find the profiles of their employees. You can search for the company on an online networking website and learn about the job experience and educational background of employees. Determine the amount of sales experience their entry-level employees have. A company that hires sales associates with little to no experience might be open to hiring you.",
                "Compose your resume. Consider your employment history that is not sales related, but that lends to your qualification for the sales jobs you are interested in. For example, if you are applying for a sales position demonstrating power tools in a home improvement store, then it would be worthwhile to highlight your past construction and public speaking experience.\n\n\nSearch your history for hidden sales experience. Have you ever sold your used furniture, or old car? Many jobs include elements of sales, even if they aren't reflected in your title. Highlight this experience on your resume.[5]\n\nMake sure your resume looks professional. Look up sample resumes for entry-level sales jobs online.\nGet help on your resume. It is easy to miss important details when editing a resume or CV. Check out the schedule of your local library or community center for free resume help. If you know any salespeople, ask them to go over your resume with you.\nCustomize your resume for each sales job you apply for. For example, if your headline reads, \"Seeking a position in sales,\" then it should be customized in a way that is specific to the job you are pursuing: \"Seeking an entry-level account representative position in the auto parts industry.\"",
                "Write a brief cover letter. You will need distinct cover letters for each application. Customize your letter to reflect the qualities the employee is looking for. For example, if the job description specifies a desire for \"honest, organized, and extroverted\" salespeople, then you can use real-life examples, sales-related or not, that exemplify your possession of those qualities.",
                "Contemplate your personal sales philosophy. You should be able to explain this to prospective employers. Using what you learned about sales, what you know about customers and your reasons for wanting to be a salesperson, formulate a vision of how you would approach a sale. Refer back to the books and articles you have read about sales. Draw up the steps of making a sale as they apply for the position you desire.\n\n\nAn example of a sales philosophy could be \"When I make a sale, I help customers make their own best decisions,\" or \"Let the customer come to you, and be ready to make them glad they did.\"",
                "Take stock of your personal qualities. When you are interviewed, your prospective employer will be looking for the personality traits of a successful salesperson. Salespeople are not required to be outgoing and debonair. Rather, they should be professional, timely, prepared, and resilient.[6]\n\nThink of stories that exemplify these qualities. If you have ever applied for a job or other position multiple times, that shows resilience.\nCompanies are looking for results-oriented salespeople. Think of goals you have achieved, and how you went about achieving them. This will likely come up in your interview.[7]",
                "Drop off your resume in person. To show that you are invested in getting the job, do more than email the company. Check online to make sure there is no policy against unsolicited visits from job seekers. Dress in professional attire and be friendly and polite to anyone you meet. Ask the person at the front desk where you should drop off your resume, and be sure to get the name of the hiring manager.\n\n\nEmail your resume and cover letter to the hiring manager after you drop them off, to make sure they have your material.\nMake a follow up call in a week if you haven't heard from the company.\nThere are companies that discourage in-person drop offs. Check ahead to ensure there are no explicit warnings against unsolicited visits. You might be turned away. Be very gracious if you are.\nIf you cannot drop off your resume in person, email it to the hiring manager.",
                "Prepare for your interview. Read the company's corporate reports, or any mentions in trade magazines. Spend time on their website, and learn specific information you can repeat during the interview. Good salespeople do research to prepare for their sales. Showing up to your interview well-prepared shows that you have the skills necessary to prepare for a sales call.[8]",
                "Arrive dressed for the job you want. Wear professional attire. If entry-level associates in your field of interest tend to dress more casually, try to dress just a little more conservatively for the interview. Neutral colors, clean and polished dress shoes, and tidy clothing that is neither tight nor loose will serve you well.[9]",
                "Demonstrate your salesperson qualities. Treat the interview like the first meeting with a prospective customer: be prepared, polite, and persuasive. Show up on time or a minute early. To show your people skills, make eye contact, and smile. Come prepared with information about the company, and answers for how your presence would fit the company's needs.[10]",
                "Describe your best-ever sale. Even if you have never held a job in sales, you most likely have, at one time or another, convinced or persuaded someone (or a group of people) in your favor. Your story should include an explanation of how you went about \"selling\" your audience on your idea, as well as a description of what the gain was, for both sides.[11]\n\nMake it evident that you are an achiever by describing some of your life's biggest achievements, whatever they may be. For example, you may have been the quarterback of your college's football team, served as president of your child's PTA, won first prize in a piano competition or had a short story published in a well-known periodical.[12]",
                "Follow your interview up with a thank-you note. If you don't hear from the employer within the time expected, put in a follow-up call. When it comes to procuring a job in sales, persistence pays off."

        "wikiHow to Treat Feline Acne": {
            "intro": "Have you noticed small black spots around your cat's chin? Your cat may have feline acne, which can occur in cats of any age or breed. While the cause of feline acne is unknown, it is more common in older cats. It's thought that stress, a compromised immune system, poor grooming habits, and other skin conditions may trigger the acne.[1] While it's usually not a major concern, it can be irritating for the cat, especially if it becomes infected. Luckily, there are some things you can do to treat it.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for small, black spots. Typically, these acne lesions are found on a cat's chin. The spots (blackheads or pimples) are small, firm and black. If you stroke him just under the chin, you'll notice that the skin feels gritty.[2]\n\nWhile acne is usually found on the chin, your cat may also have acne lesions above his lip.",
                "Understand potential causes of acne. While the exact cause of feline acne is unknown, there are several things that may trigger acne outbreaks. These include decreased grooming, food accumulating on the chin, and a weakened immune system as a result of age. The acne is usually mild and harmless, but can become sore if bacteria causes infection in the spots.[3]\n\nThe acne spots are made up of a waxy (sebaceous) material that's trapped in the hair follicles. This causes the follicle to swell and bulge, appearing on the skin's surface.",
                "Watch out for infected acne spots. If there's infection, the area may look more swollen, which can make the chin more prominent than usual. It might seem like your cat is jutting his chin out. You'll also see blood-stained discharge, which can either be watery or smelly and pus-like, coming from each spot.[4]\n\nInfection is caused by the spots bursting or the waxy material in the spot becoming contaminated with bacteria. This requires prompt treatment since it can make your cat's chin sore. Your cat may rub it more, irritating the skin. This irritation will cause further trauma and make the infection worse.",
                "Check for a leathery looking chin. If your cat has had repeated acne breakouts, the hair follicles can become severely damaged. This will create scar tissue and fur won't grow on the chin anymore. This gives the chin a leather appearance.\n\n\nIf you notice leathery or tough skin anywhere on your cat, have it checked by the veterinarian. Other conditions may cause leather skin and require treatments, such as food allergies or tumors.[5][6]",
                "Take your cat to the veterinarian. If the cat has black spots, but is otherwise well, the vet may suggest keeping the area clean with a disinfectant wash. You might be instructed to wash the area with something like dilute chlorhexidine and told to monitor the acne. But, if the area is sore, swollen, or infection is present, the vet may need to run tests to diagnose the condition and check your cat's general health.[7]\n\nA weakened immune system could be causing regular and severe lesions. The vet may do blood screening tests to check for anemia in your cat. This will determine the balance of white blood cells and check the condition of the organs.",
                "Have your cat tested for parasites. The veterinarian may want to see if parasites, like the demodex mite, are colonizing your cat's hair follicles. This can create problems similar to feline acne.[8] To test, the vet will squeeze an unruptured spot and capture the contents on a microscope slide. The slide will be examined to look for any parasites.\n\n\nIf parasites are found, the vet may recommend topical treatments, like medicated shampoos, dips, or sprays.",
                "Have your cat checked for other infections. The vet may check for the presence of other infections, such as ringworm, which cause skin inflammation and soreness. This is done by rubbing a sterile swab or brush over the skin to collect a sample of fauna from the skin surface. The sample is put into a transport medium, which is then checked for the growth of the fungal organism which causes ringworm.[9]\n\nSwabbing will not only tell the vet which bacteria are present, but will help determine which antibiotics will kill the infection.",
                "Send a tissue sample for biopsy. A definitive diagnosis of feline acne is made with a biopsy. This involves surgically removing a small wedge of tissue from the affected area. The sample is then sent to a pathologist for examination and diagnosis.[10]\n\nThis also helps to rule out predisposing factors such as mites (which burrow into the skin and can mimic acne infections), cancer, or a type of immune related inflammation called eosinophilic granuloma complex.",
                "Understand that treatment isn't always necessary. Not all cases of feline acne need treatment. If your cat has only one or two comedones (black spots) and they do not irritate him, then they can be simply managed at home. You may just gently wash the area and keep it clean after your cat eats.[11]\n\nIf your cat has a history of spots that become infected, then it is best to get treatment.",
                "Cleanse non-infected spots. If your cat has spots, but they're not infected, simply clean the spots. To clean with a surgical spirit, moisten a cotton ball with the spirit and wipe the chin twice a day until the spots have disappeared. Or, you can use a topical cleansing agent like chlorhexidine, which comes as a concentrated pink, soapy liquid. Dilute the chlorhexidine in water, with a ratio of around 5ml chlorhexidine to 100 ml of water. Moisten a cotton wool ball with the solution and wipe it over the cat's chin twice a day. Monitor the area and if the lesions worsen, check in with your vet.[12]\n\nChlorhexidine is suitable for use in cats because it is not toxic to them and does not sting. It cleanses the skin of bacteria and makes it less likely that bacteria will colonize the hair follicles.",
                "Use a follicle-flushing shampoo. To wash the chin, wet it with damp cotton wool and add a drop of benzyl peroxide shampoo to the wool. Rub this on the chin and leave it in to dry for 5 minutes. Rinse the area well using a clean flannel cloth soaked in water. If you want to treat the whole cat, dilute the shampoo, rub it into your cat's wet fur, and rinse well with warm water. Wash the affected area in the morning and evening. If redness or soreness develops, stop the treatment until the skin heals. Then start again, but dilute the shampoo more.\n\n\nPet shampoos containing benzyl peroxide are useful to treat feline acne, because the benzyl peroxide penetrates into the follicles. This will deep clean the follicle, destroy the bacteria, and remove excess waxy grease that might contribute to feline acne.[13]",
                "Apply a warm compress to the cat's skin. Soak a ball of cotton wool in moderately warm salt water. To prepare the water, boil water and stir in a teaspoon of salt. Let this mixture cool to just above body temperature. Once you've soaked the ball in the solution, squeeze out the excess moisture and hold the damp cotton wool against your cat's chin. Try to keep it there for 5 minutes. Repeat this two or three times a day until the spots burst or get smaller.\n\n\nA hot compress can help reduce the size of the spots or cause them to burst. Either way, this will relieve pressure on the follicles, which would otherwise irritate your cat's skin.",
                "Give the cat antibiotics according to the vet's instructions. The vet may prescribe oral antibiotics that you'll need to give your cat to kill bacteria on the surface of the skin. These are given by mouth at the recommended dose until the spots have cleared and then the course is extended for at least another week. Some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for feline acne include:\n\n\nCephalexin: This is a first generation antibiotic from the beta-lactam group, which targets and destroys bacteria. Usually, the dose is 30 to 50mg twice a day. So, a typical 5kg cat is given a 50mg dose of Cephalexin twice a day. This is best given with food if the cat has a sensitive stomach and is likely to vomit.[14]\n\nClindamycin: This belongs to the lincosamide group of antibiotics which stop bacteria from reproducing. The dose is usually 5 to 10mg/kg twice a day, or the dose can be combined and given once a day. So, a 5kg cat will take a 25mg capsule twice a day. This antibiotic is more effective if given on an empty stomach.\nClavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin: This antibiotic works by interfering with bacterial metabolism and damaging the bacteria's cell wall. The dose in the cat is 50mg per 5kg, so a 5kg cat is given 50mg dose twice daily, either with or without food.",
                "Prevent feline acne. While older cats are more likely to get acne (possibly because their arthritis makes it harder to groom and remove food debris from their chins), there are things you can do to make feline acne less likely. If your cat has a history of acne, wipe his chin after he eats and pat the area dry. This can prevent oil buildup and bacterial infection from food that's become trapped in the hair follicles.[15]\n\nYou should also wash out your cat's food bowls every few days. This prevents bacteria from accumulating, which could contribute to feline acne."

        "How to Create a Revocable Trust": {
            "intro": "A trust is a probate-free approach to passing assets to your beneficiaries when you die. When you create a “revocable” trust, you fund the trust during your lifetime and can change the trust or cancel it at any time. Trusts are governed by state law, so be sure you are in accord with any local requirements before proceeding. To create this type of trust, you should identify the property you want to transfer. Then you need to draft a trust document, in which you explain who should receive the property when you die. If you have questions, consult a qualified trusts and estates attorney. While a trust may avoid probate and other such entanglements, it will not avoid taxes on an estate or income associated with the trust property in any way. Note that while another name for a revocable trust is a \"living trust,\" this is not the same as a living will and should not be confused with it.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider adding real estate. You can put a house or other piece of property into your revocable trust. You can include property even if it has a mortgage on it.[1] Consider whether you want to leave property to your heirs through a trust.\n\n\nBecause the trust is revocable, you can change your mind at any time (unless you become incapacitated). The only cost you will incur is the cost of retitling property back to your own name.\nRealize that the mortgage follows the property into the trust.",
                "Identify business interests. Your ownership interest in any business is probably quite valuable. You should consider leaving those interests to people in your revocable trust. For example, you might leave the following:[2]\n\nYou can transfer the assets and business name of a sole proprietorship to the revocable trust.\nYou might be able transfer your ownership interest in a partnership to the trust, although you should check the partnership document first. Some partnership documents limit your ability to make this transfer.\nYou might also be able to transfer shares in a closely held company to your revocable trust.\nYou may also be able to transfer your ownership interest in a limited liability company, though you will need other owners to agree.\nA trust can own business property but cannot operate a business. If the business interests to be transferred are S corporation shares, care must be taken not to violate the ownership rules for S status.",
                "Add financial accounts. You can also add different financial accounts to your revocable trust. Once you include the account in the trust, the trust owns the assets in the account. Consider adding the following to your revocable trust:[3]\n\nstocks\nbonds",
                "Include intellectual property assets. Many people own valuable property that is intangible. This kind of property is often called intellectual property. You might have some of the following, which you can put into your trust:\n\n\npatents\ncopyrighted creative works",
                "Find other valuables to add. Go through your possessions and identify what else you would like to leave. You don’t have to add every single possession you own to your trust. However, you should add things that have substantial value, such as the following:[4]\n\nantiques\nartwork\nfurniture\ncoins\nother collector’s items",
                "Identify what not to add to a revocable trust. You can’t add some property to a trust, either because doing so is too cumbersome or because it is illegal. In particular, you shouldn’t add the following:[5]\n\nRetirement accounts and 401(k)s. However, you can name your trust as a beneficiary.\nLife insurance. Your beneficiaries are named on your policy. However, you can name your trust as a beneficiary.\nCash. You can’t transfer cash, though you can name someone as the beneficiary of a cash account. They then get whatever is in the account at your death.\nSecurities. It’s better to use transfer-on-death registration instead.\nVehicles. Although you can legally transfer a vehicle to a living trust, some insurers are confused when a trust is the owner. It’s probably easier not to own vehicles in a trust.",
                "Determine who will receive your property. At death, your property will be transferred to beneficiaries. You should identify who you want to receive your property.[6] Also choose someone to inherit in case the original beneficiary dies before you.\n\n\nYou can also give the trustee instructions for how to distribute property. For example, if you are leaving assets to minors, you might not want the trustee to transfer the property until they reach a certain age, such as 21.",
                "Include a durable power of attorney. You can appoint someone to manage your affairs should you become incapacitated.[7] Include a power of attorney in your trust. The agent you appoint can make medical decisions for you and handle your finances.\n\n\nThe agent you appoint should be someone you trust, such as a child or spouse.\nTalk to your agent ahead of time to decide what kinds of treatment you want to receive once you are incapacitated. A trusted agent should honor your wishes.\nAlso remember to name one or more successor agents in case your first pick cannot serve in the role.",
                "Appoint a trustee. The trustee will manage the property owned by the trust. As long as you are living, you will be the trustee. However, you’ll need to appoint someone to succeed you as trustee after you die. This person will be responsible for transferring assets to your beneficiaries.[8]\n\nThe trustee might also manage assets on behalf of minor children or disabled adults. In that situation, you might want to name someone with experience managing trust assets, such as a lawyer or asset management company.\nYou might decide to make the successor trustee the primary beneficiary. For example, if you leave everything to your only child, then you could name them as the successor trustee.",
                "Find sample trusts. You can draft a revocable trust by finding samples online and using them as models for your own. For example, Nolo has a revocable living trust document.[9] You can also find sample trust documents in books at your local library.\n\n\nIn addition, you might want to use software or online programs that can help you. These programs ask you sample questions and create a trust document based on your answers.",
                "Consult with a trusts and estates attorney. You can certainly draft a simple revocable trust on your own. However, you should definitely consult with an experienced trusts and estates attorney. They can review your document and identify anything that is missing.\n\n\n\nFind a trusts and estates attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.[10] Ask for a referral.\nCall up the attorney and schedule a meeting. Tell them you have a draft trust document you want them to review. Ask how much they will charge to review the document.",
                "Execute the trust. You’ll need to sign your trust in front of a notary public. Accordingly, you should include a notary block at the bottom of your document.[11] Search online for an appropriate block.\n\n\nYou can find a notary at your county courthouse, town office, or at most large banks. Make sure to take sufficient personal identification with you, such as a valid driver’s license or passport.\nYou should also sign the trust in front of a witness, who cannot be a beneficiary.[12] Check with a lawyer about your state’s precise legal requirements.",
                "Re-title assets. The trust must hold assets included in the trust. This means you will hold the assets in your position as trustee. For example, you might transfer real estate to “Michael Jones, trustee of the Michael Jones Revocable Living Trust dated April 11, 2017.”[13] Record the new deed with your county Recorder of Deeds office.\n\n\nSome assets don’t have a title. However, you can transfer financial instruments into a new account owned by the trust.[14]\n\nFor other assets, you can draft an “Assignment of Untitled Tangible Personal Property” and include it with your trust.[15] You should also create a schedule and list all assets on it. Attach the schedule to your trust document.",
                "Remove property from the trust. With a revocable trust, you can easily remove property if you no longer want to include it. You should re-title the property back into your own name.\n\n\nAny property not in the trust at your time of death can’t be transferred to anyone via trust. However, it will now be transferred by your will or by the intestacy laws if you have no will.\nYou should also remove the asset from the schedule attached to the trust.[16] Your trust should be set up so that you don’t need to draft an amendment.",
                "Amend the trust. You’ll need to amend your trust if you want to change a beneficiary, name a different successor trustee, or appoint a different agent to make decisions when you are incapacitated. If you’re adding property, you may also need to add an amendment (unless the property is going to the same person you have left all property to). Trust amendments are easy to draft, but remember the following:\n\n\nIdentify the trust you are amending. Identify by name and date.\nAlso state the provision of the trust that gives you the power to amend.[17]\n\nAlways include a statement that you intend the rest of the trust to remain in effect. For example, you can write, “In all other respects, the trust remains unchanged.”\nExecute the trust amendment using the same formalities that you did for the original trust.",
                "Revoke the trust. You might want to get rid of the entire trust. Think carefully before doing this. Don’t revoke if all you want to do is amend. Common reasons to revoke a trust include getting divorced or making extensive changes.[18]\n\nYou need to revoke your trust in a writing which you sign and date.[19] Find templates online or consult with an estate attorney.\nRemember to transfer all property from yourself as trustee to yourself. This means you’ll need to retitle property. For example, you should execute a quitclaim deed to transfer real estate from the trust back to you.[20]",
                "Decide what you want to do with your property. If you remove property from a trust or revoke your trust entirely, you need to decide what you want to do with your property. A revocable trust is not a good substitute for a will and you should probably draft a will if this was your intention. If you don’t, then you can’t control who will receive your property when you die."

        "How to Cross Stitch": {
            "intro": "Taking up needle point? If so, one of the stitches you'll need to learn is the cross stitch. This ancient, cross-cultural embroidery technique is also known as counted cross-stitch. The pictures below will show the method as worked on plastic canvas with yarn to help you easily identify the technique.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose your fabric. Although cross stitch refers to the way in which you create a stitched pattern and not to a particular fabric, it is most often done on a type of material known as Aida cloth. This material is loosely woven in a grid pattern that makes lining up all your stitches easy. Aida fabric comes in different sizes which refer to the number of stitches that can be created in 1 square inch. The options are typically 11, 14, 18, and 28.\n\n\nIt is easiest to start on an Aida cloth that uses an 11 or 14 stitch count, as this provides larger spaces for your cross stitch. The higher the number of stitches, the smaller your crosses will be.\nIf you don't want to use Aida cloth for your cross stitch, other popular options are linen or fiddlers cloth. Both these lack the same wide spaces Aida cloth provides for beginners though.[1]",
                "Select your thread. Cross stitch is great because it offers so much freedom on the part of the maker, particularly in the color options of thread. Embroidery floss is typically used and can be found in hundreds of colors.\n\n\nEach skein of embroidery floss comes in six threads, but only 1-3 will be used for cross stitch at a time.\nEmbroidery floss comes in both matte colors as well as iridescent and metallic. The latter two are a bit more difficult to work with and cost several times more than the former.\nIf you have a difficult time doing cross stitch with your thread, you can get waxed thread or use a bit of beeswax to prep your thread before starting your stitching. It will help the floss to thread and tie off easier.[2]",
                "Choose a pattern. Cross stitching is as simple as matching the grid on a pattern of choice to the grid in your cross-stitch fabric. Choose a pattern from a booklet or online, and gather embroidery floss in colors to match.\n\n\nAs a beginner, it may be best to start with a simple cross stitch. Find a pattern that is small and doesn’t involve too many details and uses a total of 3-7 colors only.\nYou can create your own pattern using your own images and a computer program or a bit of graph paper if you don't like the patterns that are available.",
                "Get an embroidery hoop. This is a double ring made of plastic, metal, or wood that secures your cross stitch as you work. Although you can create a cross stitch without one, embroidery hoops are incredibly helpful and relatively inexpensive. Small hoops are easier to hold but must be moved often, while large hoops require more of a grip but need to be moved around your needlepoint less.",
                "Choose an image. Any image can be created into a cross stitch pattern, but simple ones with easily definable shapes are best. Choose a picture or drawing that has only a few colors and lacks a lot of detail.",
                "Adjust your image. You may want to crop and enlarge your image so that you focus on only a single portion of the original picture. If you have a photo editing program, use a \"posterize\" feature to transform your picture into easily definable shapes. Convert your picture to grayscale before printing so that choosing colors to match the values is easier.",
                "Trace your image. Print a physical copy of your image and gather a piece of graph paper. Lay the graph paper over the top of your printed image and trace the outline of the most basic shapes. Try to limit the amount of detail that you copy over.",
                "Choose your colors. With your image and shapes traced, choose 3-7 colors to use for your cross stitch. Use colored pencils that match your chosen colors to shade in the shapes, focusing on a grid pattern and avoiding curved lines.[3]",
                "Use a computer program. If drawing your own pattern by hand isn't your deal, try using an easy computer program to convert your favorite image to a cross stitch pattern. Programs such as \"Pic 2 Pat\" allow you to choose the size of the pattern, number of colors, and amount of detail included in your finished pattern.[4]",
                "Cut your fabric and floss. The size of your fabric will depend on the size of the pattern you are using. Each small square on the cross stitch fabric is representational of a single stitch (or ‘x’ shaped cross), and can be counted across to get your exact size. Your embroidery floss should be cut to a length of about 36” to begin.\n\n\nEmbroidery floss comes in strands of six threads, but typically only one is necessary for cross stitching. Gently pull apart the groupings of threads from the center and use a single thread for each section on your pattern.\nSome patterns may call for multiple threads to be used at once, so make sure to check yours before assuming the use of a single thread.\nIf you run out of thread for your pattern, don’t fear! One of the great things about cross stitching is that you can’t tell where you start/stop from the front. Simply cut additional thread and start again from where you left off.",
                "Thread your needle. Take your single thread of embroidery floss and create a loop at the end. Wet the center of this loop (by licking it or using a drop of water) to make threading it easier. Then pull the loop through, leaving the two tail ends (one should be very short) to hang out the opposite side of the eye of the needle.",
                "Begin your cross stitch. Count on your pattern the number of grid spaces to the first stitch (typically the centermost stitch), and insert your needle from the bottom. Pull the thread all the way through, leaving a bit of the loop at the bottom. Then, cross the thread down or up diagonally and pull the needle through the loop underneath to create a stable anchor for your stitching.\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you start your cross stitch going ‘////’ or ‘\\\\\\\\’ as long as you are consistent with this pattern over the entirety of your project.\nWith every stitch you make, thread your strings over the loose tail in the back to secure it to your cross stitch fabric. This will also make it less likely for your cross stitch to unravel from being tugged or pulled.[5]",
                "Continue stitching. Using the same ‘x’ stitch pattern, work outwards from the center of your cross stitch until you have completed the pattern. If you run out of thread at any point, tie the floss off in a knot at the back and cut a new piece.",
                "Finish your piece. When you have completed the pattern and added an optional backstitch border, tie off your thread underneath your cross stitch. Tie a simple knot on the backside of your pattern, and cut off any remaining thread.[6]",
                "Wash your cross stitch. Hands are naturally very dirty and oily, and as such make the fabric of your needlepoint dirty as well. Frequent hand washing cans help to limit the amount of grime that is transferred to your fabric, but a ring of dirt around your embroidery hoop is nearly inevitable. Gently hand wash your cross stitch with soap and water and allow to air dry when you are finished with it.",
                "Create a quarter stitch. Quarter stitches are, as they sound, 1/4 of a completed 'X' shape in a cross stitch. These can be used to add subtly curved lines and lots of detail. To Create a 1/4 stitch, bring your needle from the corner of one of the boxes through the center of the box. This should create a single leg of the \"X\" shape.",
                "Make a three-quarter stitch. This stitch is another commonly used stitch for creating detail in your pattern. It is made by doing a half stitch (a complete diagonal stitch) and a quarter stitch. The appearance is of an \"X\" with only three legs instead of four.",
                "Create a back stitch. To create a solid border around your cross stitched figures, use a single strand of embroidery floss (black is usually used) and back stitch around the outline of your pattern. To create a back stitch, work vertically and horizontally (rather than creating ‘/’ or ‘\\’ shaped stitches, form ‘|’ or ‘_’ shaped stitches) around your figure. Pull the needle up at the top of a box, and then back through at the bottom, repeating this pattern until you have completed the border.",
                "Do a French knot. Although this is not a traditional cross stitch, it can be used to create small dots or spots on your needle point. To create a French knot, pull your thread up through your fabric. Wrap your needle around the thread 2-3 times near the base of the entrance of the thread. Insert the needle back down into the fabric near the origin, holding the thread taut as you do so. Pull the needle all the way through to complete the French knot.[7]"

        "How to Put a Strap On a Guitar": {
            "intro": "If you intend to play your guitar in any position other than sitting down, it's a wise idea to have a strap for your guitar. Guitar straps support the guitar as you play, putting its weight on your shoulder so that you can effortlessly jam standing up. See Step 1 below to start learning how to put a strap on both electric and acoustic guitars, as well as how to use handy strap lock accessories.",
            "steps": [
                "Find a strap that's right for you. Guitar straps come in a wide variety of styles and sizes - some are audacious, some are plain, some are thick and padded, others are thin \"seat belt\"-style straps. Check out the selection at your local music store or in classified ads to get a sense of the options available to you. Below are just a few things you'll want to consider when picking out a strap:\n\n\nMaterial - Many of the most affordable straps are made from the aforementioned seat belt-style material, but for a little more cash, it's possible to buy durable all-leather straps.\nSize - Not usually a major concern because the vast majority of guitar straps are adjustable, but you'll still want to be sure the strap is at least long enough to allow comfortable playing while standing up.\nPadding - Some guitar straps incorporate padding into the part of the strap that is slung over your shoulder to make playing more comfortable. This is usually made from foam, but sometimes fur or other materials are used.\nAesthetics - Guitar straps come in a huge variety of colors and designs. Pick one that's right for your \"sound\".",
                "Find the holes on either end of the strap. Guitar straps typically have leather (or fake leather) ends in the shape of rounded triangles. On each end should be a small hole with a slit cut in the side of it. These holes will support the weight of your guitar while you play.",
                "Connect the strap to the knob at the base of your guitar's body. Almost all electric guitars have two small knobs that fit into the holes on the strap. The first of these is at the base of the guitar's body - in other words, if you stand the guitar up vertically, it will be at the \"bottom\" of the guitar. This knob typically sticks out about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) depending on what type of guitar you have. Slip the hole that is farther from the strap's belt-like tightening/loosening buckle over this knob.\n\nTo ensure comfort during playing, ensure that you slip the strap hole over the knob so that the fitting buckle faces outwards - otherwise, it may dig into your shoulder.",
                "Slip the other hole on the strap over the second knob. Look at the spot where the neck of the guitar meets the body. Nearly all electric guitars will have a knob near here. Slip the second strap-hole - the one that's closer to the buckle used to adjust the strap - over this knob. Put the other end of the strap on this knob.",
                "Slip the strap over your shoulder. Congratulations - your guitar is now \"strapped up\". Now, it's time to test out the strap. If you are right-handed, sling the strap over your left shoulder so that the guitar hangs in front of you, allowing you to strum with your right hand and fret with your left. If you are left-handed, do the reverse - sling the strap over your right shoulder.",
                "Test your strap out by playing. Now, ensure your strap fits comfortably and doesn't inhibit your movement by playing a few simple chords or songs. Try playing in a variety of ways - standing up, sitting down, and even kneeling or laying down, for instance.",
                "Adjust the strap's length as needed. When you play with a strap, you want your playing to come as easily and as naturally as it would without one. This means that your strap should allow the guitar to hang at such a height that you can strum and fret as you normally would. Use the strap's adjustable buckle to change the length of the strap as needed for your comfort and ease of playing.",
                "Grab a short length of string. Unlike electrics, most acoustic guitars only have one knob to hook the strap onto. Because of this, you'll usually need to use a piece of string or twine to tie one end of the strap to the headstock. This string can be made from virtually anything as long as it's thin enough to fit under the strings behind the nut.\n\n\nIf you don't have any string handy, try using an old shoelace - they're usually about the right length and thickness and are surprisingly durable.",
                "Attach one end of the strap to the knob at the base of the guitar. The first part of putting a strap on an acoustic guitar is the same as for an electric. Slide the hole on the end of the strap that is farther from the buckle onto the knob at the base of the body of the acoustic.\n\nAs above, be sure to orient the strap so that the buckle faces outward and doesn't dig into your shoulder while playing.",
                "Slip the string through the hole at the other end of the strap. Because the acoustic guitar has only one knob, the other end must be tied to the headstock. Begin by passing the string through the hole that isn't currently attached to the guitar's knob (the hole at the end of the strap closer to the buckle).",
                "Slip the string under the strings and around the headstock. Take one end of your string and pass it under the strings just behind the nut (the wood or plastic piece at the far end of the fretboard that keeps the strings separated). Bring the end of the string under and around the headstock. The string should ideally rest just behind the nut.",
                "Secure the string with a sturdy knot. Next, tie the ends of your string together. If your string is exceptionally long, you may want to \"double it up\" to reduce the distance between the strap and the headstock. Use a strong knot (or knots) - you don't want this string to come untied while you're playing.",
                "Test your strap and adjust as necessary. Congratulations - your acoustic guitar is now ready to play! Test your strap out by playing in a variety of positions (as above). Use the buckle to make adjustments to the length of the strap as necessary. Listen to the sound of your notes - the string tied around the headstock shouldn't muffle or otherwise interfere with the normal vibrations of the strings in any way.\n\n\nIf the length of the string is too long or short to allow for comfortable playing, you may need to untie it and adjust it to a suitable length.",
                "Install a second knob at your own risk. Rather than tie their strap to the headstock, some guitarists choose to install a second knob on their acoustic guitar. Usually, the knob is installed where the neck meets the body (to mimic the arrangement of knobs on an electric). Only attempt this if you have experience modifying guitars. Doing this incorrectly can permanently damage the guitar by splitting its wood.",
                "Pick up strap locks at your local music store. One commonly-used strap accessory that can potentially save you major headaches (not to mention lots of cash) is the strap lock. Strap locks usually take the form of simple plastic or metal caps that slide over the guitar's knobs after you've put them through the holes in the strap. These handy tools keep the guitar from falling out of its strap while you're playing, potentially preventing permanent damage and/or hundreds of dollars in repairs. Best of all, they're available in a wide variety of styles at most local music stores for quite cheap - often just a few dollars!",
                "Install basic plastic locks by putting them over the knob and twisting. Normal, inexpensive plastic strap locks usually take the form of small discs with holes in the middle and a set of ridges on a rotating upper portion. These can be installed by pushing the guitar knob through the central hole and using the ridges to twist the lock into place. After doing this for each knob, the strap should remain in place no matter how you twist or pull it while playing.",
                "Use a set of metal locks for added security. The \"premium\" option when it comes to strap locks is a special set of interlocking metal fasteners. This type of strap lock is a little more expensive than basic plastic options and requires you to modify both your guitar and your strap, but offers total protection from slippage. To use this type of strap lock, you'll need to remove the knobs from your guitar and install new ones that are specially designed to interface with the lock. You'll also need to secure the locking mechanism inside holes of your guitar strap. When everything is in place, the locks should \"click\" into place on the knobs. Once locked, the strap can't be removed except by deliberately pulling the release on each lock.",
                "Improvise a set of strap locks by using rubber washers. Though strap locks are generally fairly cheap, there are free alternatives. For instance, one easy trick is to place a tight-fitting rubber washer over the top of each knob after placing the strap on the guitar. The rubber washer will hold the strap in place while playing, making it more difficult (but not impossible) for the strap to fall off of the guitar.\n\n\nYou can find rubber washers at your local hardware store - you'll usually want the 5/16\" variety. Alternatively, if you drink beer or soda that comes in an old-fashioned bottle with a locking cap, you can remove the washer from the underside of the cap and use it for this purpose."

        "wikiHow to Choose a Pool Cue": {
            "intro": "If you need to buy a new pool cue, there are a few ways to make sure you get the right one for you. You’ll need to establish a budget and decide between a one-piece or two-piece cue. You should always hold a pool cue in your hand and check a few things before you buy it. Choosing a wrap, selecting a cue weight, checking the cue’s straightness, and testing the cue out on a pool table are all important.",
            "steps": [
                "Set a budget. A good pool cue is not worth going into debt over, so be honest with yourself about how much you can afford to spend on a cue. Having a specific price limit in mind will help you be more selective about what cue you choose. For a quality cue on the low end of the price scale, plan for about $100.[1]\n\nFactors that affect the cost are the material the cue is made of, wrap types, and size. If you are above average height and need a longer cue, you may pay more.\nProfessional cues can cost $500 or more, but a cue like this is not necessary for a casual player.",
                "Select a one-piece cue for home use. One-piece cues do not come apart, so they are not meant for travel. For a home pool table, you don’t need a cue that is made to travel. One piece cues tend to be a little cheaper, and they are the best option for home use.\n\n\nIt’s not that one-piece cues can’t be taken somewhere, but it will be inconvenient to take a nearly five foot stick in your car with you.\nA potential disadvantage of a one-piece cue is that they are more prone to warp over time.",
                "Buy a two-piece cue for travel and competitive play. If you are buying a pool cue so that you can play in tournaments outside of your own home, it’s wise to buy a cue that can be broken down into two pieces. These typically come with some kind of carrying case to make travel easier.[2]\n\nYou can still buy a two-piece cue for home use if you find one that fits you well, but it isn’t necessary.\nA benefit of two-piece cues is that if the shaft begins to warp, you can buy a new shaft and retain the butt of the cue.",
                "Pick a cue that is the right length for your height. Standard cues tend to be 57 inches for one-piece cues or 58 inches for two-piece cues, but children or people of below average height should opt for a 48 inch or 52 inch cue. Players over 6 foot, 5 inches tall may need to special order a cue that is up to 61 inches long.[3]",
                "Hold the cue in your hand to feel the weight. Pool cues weigh between 17 ounces and 21 ounces, with most players preferring either 19 ounce or 20 ounce cues. The weight affects your shot, so it’s important to choose a weight that you can easily use.[4]\n\nMost of the cue’s weight is in the butt end because the butt is thicker than the shaft. If you test the cue and it feels too heavy in your back hand then opt for a lighter cue.\nShort people tend to want a lighter cue because a heavier one will cause them to lower the butt and raise the cue’s tip during the shot. This results in not connecting solidly with the ball.\nSome players prefer a heavier cue for breaking and a lighter cue for skill shots.",
                "Choose a comfortable wrap. The wrap is the part of the cue that you hold with your back hand. Since this is the part of the cue that you have the most skin contact with, you want to be comfortable. Wrap options include leather and linen, but some cues may not have a wrap at all.[5]\n\nIf you tend to have sweaty hands when you shoot pool, you definitely want a grip rather than bare wood or fiberglass. Your best options are Irish linen or leather which are both good for absorption.\nRubber grips are also available but you want to make sure that the rubber is of a high quality and feels smooth and dry without any stickiness. Rubber wraps might deteriorate faster than leather or linen wraps.\nThis is not something you can choose just by looking at it. You need to hold the cue in your hand and choose a wrap that feels best to you.",
                "Look down the length of the cue to judge its straightness. Hold the butt of the cue at eye level and stare down its length. Slowly spin the cue to see around the whole surface. Look for any abnormalities in the cue. Only buy a cue that is perfectly straight.[6]\n\nMost pool cues are manufactured to a high standard, so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a new cue that is crooked, but it is still good to check.\nIt is sometimes recommended to roll the cue along a flat surface to see if it rolls smoothly, but this is not always a valid test as you can’t tell for sure if the surface is perfectly flat.",
                "Choose a tip. Tips come in soft, medium and hard. Each tip type offers a slight difference in play. Soft tips are great if you put a lot of spin on the cue ball. Hard tips tend to last longer but are less capable for ball spin. Medium tips are fairly standard on new cues.[7]\n\nSoft tips tend to misshape and wear out faster, so if you do not want to keep an eye on them and perform more frequent maintenance, don’t get a soft tip.\nHard tips are more prone to glance off of the cue ball when you strike it off center. If you typically shoot more toward the outside of the ball, a hard tip is not your best option.",
                "Take practice shots on a pool table. If you are buying from a store that has tables set up, you should test the cue you choose before you buy it. Get into proper shooting position and take four or five shots with the cue.[8]\n\nIf the store does not have tables set up or they won’t let you practice, ask what the return policy is so that you can play a game or two with the cue before you make a final decision.\nYou won’t be able to tell if a cue is right for you unless you play with it.",
                "Opt for the stick with the least vibration within your price range. Listen to the sound the cue makes hitting the ball, and feel the vibration in your hand. If you hear a loud click when you strike the ball, you will probably also feel a strong vibration. A softer pop sound means less vibration.\n\n\nHigher end cues will make more of a soft pop sound when they hit the ball and this corresponds to less vibration running through the stick into your hand.\nVibration affects the smoothness of your shot, so you want to find a stick with low vibration."

            "intro": "Acne happens to just about everyone at some point in their lives, but there are a few things you can do to keep your face acne free. Read this wikiHow to learn more.",
            "steps": [
                "Don't pop your pimples. This is the number one rule! Pimples contain nasty bacteria. If you pop your pimples, that bacteria has a chance of getting inside other pores and giving them a place to stay without charging rent, so to speak. Make sure your pimples pay rent.",
                "Consider going without makeup for a while. Foundation and lipstick can be harmful to the skin. Although it may be a bit embarrassing going fresh faced if you have bad skin, going \"bare\" will definitely help your skin clear up.",
                "Another disadvantage of popping pimples is that the skin around the pimple, and the pimple itself, will become inflamed. Inflammation will cause even more redness and pain.",
                "Try not to touch your face. Your hands (no matter how many times you wash them) have oils and dirt on them, and are vectors for bacteria. If you're constantly wiping that dirt, oil, and bacteria back onto your face, chances are it's not going to respond too well and you will also end up spreading even more the bacteria to other areas of your face.",
                "Drink enough water. Many doctors recommend that you drink between 9 and 12 cups of water per day (2.2 to 3 liters), depending on whether you are a girl or guy.[1] (Women should drink 9 cups, men should drink 12.) Your skin is an organ in your body, too, and like your kidney, it needs adequate amounts of water to function properly.",
                "Cut sweet, sugary drinks like sodas, juices, and smoothies out of your diet. Although the evidence has been disputed for decades, new reports seem to indicate that diets do have a substantial effect on acne, listing sugar as a trigger.[2] Sugars cause a spike in insulin, which in turn stimulates certain pimple producing hormones.",
                "Drink less milk. Milk, too, has recently been implicated as an acne-producing agent. Milk stimulates male sex hormones — testosterone and androgens — that, along with insulin, cause nasty pimples.[2]",
                "Unsweetened green tea may be helpful, too. Green tea contains tons of antioxidants that help fight free radicals; free radicals affect the cells that may be responsible for signs of aging in the skin. For a healthy alternative to water, brew some tasty and healthy green tea!",
                "Eat a balanced diet. Diet can help your complexion look its best if you let it. There's nothing amazing about the following sentence, and you can probably guess what it's going to be: eat more fruits and vegetables, more healthy fats, and experiment with probiotics",
                "People who eat more fruits and veggies, and less milk and sugar, tend to have less acne.[2] Make sure you get 5 to 9 servings of healthy vegetables (especially leafy greens) per day.",
                "Eat omega-3 fatty acids. There's fat, and then there's healthy fat. Healthy fats, like omega-3s, help fight inflammation and promote healthy cells.[3] Omega-3s are damaged by oxygen, meaning if you eat foods that are rich in omega-3s, try to eat them raw. In a pinch, baked or broiled is better than boiling or fried. Foods rich in omega-3s include:\n\n\nFish, particularly salmon, sardines, and herring.[4]\n\nSeeds and nuts, particularly flaxseed.[4]\n\nLeafy greens, particularly spinach and arugula.[4]",
                "Consider probiotics. Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in certain foods, such as kombucha, that promote good digestive health and cut down inflammation. Probiotics such as lactobacillus may improve acne. Look for probiotics at your local grocer's or natural health store.",
                "Eat the right vitamins, in moderation. This one is another no-brainer. The right kind of vitamins will help your body create vibrant, wonderful skin and fight acne to boot. Vitamin-A has been particularly effective in promoting healthy skin. Do not take vitamin-A if you are pregnant.",
                "Try evening primrose oil. Evening primrose oil is an anti-inflammatory omega-6 fat, a deficiency of which may cause acne.[5] Take 1000 to 1500mg twice a day.",
                "Try zinc citrate. Zinc citrate helps with protein synthesis, wound healing, and normal tissue function. Take 30 mg a day.",
                "Try vitamin-E. Critical for skin health, vitamin-E is low in many acne sufferers.[5] Take 400 IU (international units) a day.",
                "Don't try to wash your face more than twice a day. Washing your face too much will only make your face dry, causing your face to produce more oils, which unfortunately equals more acne.",
                "Moisturize after each time you wash your face. Washing strips the moisture from your skin as it fights the acne-producing bacteria. Ensure that you give your skin the moisture it needs, even if you have naturally oily skin.",
                "Use moisturizers that are non-comedogenic. This simply means that they won't clog your pores. You don't want your moisturizer to clog pores right after you've cleaned them.",
                "If you do happen to have naturally oily skin, try looking for a gel-based moisturizer. These kinds of moisturizers, as opposed to cream-based moisturizers, won't make your skin feel as clammy and oily.",
                "Use a toner for oily skin. What is a toner? A toner is a lotion or wash that helps shrink your pores while cleaning grime and dirt away. Be careful about toners with alcohol because they will wipe away the oil from your face. This causes more oil to be produced, along with more acne. Find a toner that is low on alcohol but still effective.",
                "Remove as much unhealthy stress from your life as possible. Doctors aren't completely sure why, but they do know that there is a link between stress and skin disorders, specifically stress and acne. Somehow, the cells that produce sebum, which is the stuff that ultimately causes acne, become unregulated when a person experiences a lot of stress.[6]",
                "Find creative outlets for your stress. Some people detach from stressful situations by taking a walk. Others pour their stress out onto a canvas by painting. Whatever it is that you do to decompress, do it early and do it often.",
                "Try meditation techniques. There are numerous meditation techniques, so find the one(s) that work for you. Some people choose yoga for meditation.",
                "Make sure you're getting enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can cause stress and increase acne[7] As we learned above, stress can have a deleterious effect on skin, causing acne.\nSpeaking of sleep, change your pillowcase on a regular basis. Consider wrapping your pillowcase in a towel to absorb oil. You can flip the towel over the next night.",
                "Young and elderly people need more sleep than adults. Teenagers should try to get between 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night.[8]",
                "Exercise. For pretty much any ailment aside from muscle or bone damage, exercise is a panacea. Exercise is a great option for getting your circulation going, and anything that promotes good circulation also helps keep your skin healthy and vibrant-looking.[9] A couple things to remember when you exercise:",
                "Always wear sunscreen if exercising outdoors. The benefits of getting your circulation jump started can be outweighed by the disadvantages of sun damage if you're not careful. Wear sunscreen that is light and doesn't irritate or sting your skin.",
                "Shower or clean yourself after you exercise. When you sweat, your pores can get clogged with salty, dirty residue that's leftover from your workout. Be sure to wash your body, and especially your face, after you exercise.",
                "Try some benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that contribute to acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions, and it's less irritating to the skin to boot. Benzoyl peroxide also helps peel away layers of dead skin, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated skin in its place.",
                "Use salicylic acid. Like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid kills bacteria responsible for pimple growth. It also causes skin cells to shed more rapidly, promoting the growth of new skin. Put small amounts of salicylic acid onto affected areas before you go asleep, after you have washed your face.",
                "Use toothpaste. Toothpaste contains silica, which is the drying agent you find in bags of beef jerky, among other things. Basically, toothpaste will dry out your pimple overnight, reducing it in size.",
                "Make sure to use natural toothpaste when you dab it onto your skin. Some toothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate can irritate the skin. Watch out for it before applying.",
                "Try tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is an antibacterial essential oil that can blast the microbes that have started to make a home inside of your pores. With a dropper, dab a Q-Tip with a bit of tea tree oil and apply to pimples as needed, being careful not to put on too much.",
                "Tea tree oil has anti-inflammatory properties[10] that can make the redness and size of the pimple less noticeable.",
                "Crush up some aspirin. Crush up an aspirin tablet and add just enough water to make it into a paste. With a Q-Tip, add the aspirin paste to the pimple(s) lightly, covering entirely. Let dry. Aspirin is another anti-inflammatory, meaning it will help the skin fight against inflammation, making the pimple less visible. Let the aspirin paste fight the pimple overnight.",
                "Use astringents on oily skin. Astringents are agents that cause the skin to contract or get smaller. Some pharmaceutical astringents contain antimicrobial ingredients that will help fight the pimple in addition to reducing the size of the pimple. Here are some astringents to consider using:",
                "Store bought astringents. These come in different types and sizes. Look for one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Ask for astringents that are gentle on the skin.",
                "Natural astringents may also work in a pinch. They include:",
                "Lemon juice. The citric acid here kills the bacteria that cause acne and act as a skin-tightener. Many people swear by it. Slice a lemon and gently rub it over the affected area.",
                "Banana peel. Banana peels are helpful in treating insect and mosquito bites, and may be helpful in reducing the size of some pimples. Gently rub the banana peel over the affected area.",
                "Witch hazel. Another great astringent with a ton of applications. Look for witch hazel that doesn't contain alcohol. Apply a small bit over affected area and let dry.",
                "Green tea. Green tea is an astringent that's packed with lots of antioxidants, which help reduce signs of aging by fighting free radicals. Steep a tea bag in some hot water, remove the tea bag along with all the liquid, and place onto affected area briefly.",
                "Apply ice cubes if necessary. Rub an ice cube over the acne on your face until the area goes numb. When your face goes numb, stop; leave your face alone until it's warm again.",
                "As mentioned above, ice will help diminish the size of the pores by constricting the blood vessels underneath the skin. If your acne is painful, it should help ease the pain.",
                "If you have a lot of acne, work in sections. When one section goes numb, move to the next section.",
                "Repeat this process around your face.",
                "Use eye-drops on the affected area. Eye drops, at least the ones that reduce redness in the eyes, can be helpful in reducing redness and signs of irritation in acne. Drop a few eye-drops onto a Q-Tip and apply as necessary onto the pimple(s).",
                "Because cold also helps reduce inflammation in acne, place the Q-Tip soaked in eye-drops into the freezer for an hour before applying. The cold Q-Tip will soothe as it reduces inflammation.",
                "Try some natural antihistamines. Antihistamines suppress the swelling effect in the skin tissue of people. Most of these remedies can be ingested in pill form, but some can be consumed as tea or used as a topical agent. These should offer a reduction in redness. Natural herbal antihistamines include:",
                "Stinging nettle. This may sound weird, because touching nettles in the wild can produce a rash not unlike small pimples. Some doctors, however, recommend taking a freeze-dried preparation of stinging nettle, which is known for its ability to reduce the amount of histamine the body produces.",
                "Coltsfoot may be effective as a natural antihistamine. Europeans have a long history of using the plant to cure skin conditions. The leaves can either be ground up into a paste or coltsfoot extract can be ingested in pill form.",
                "Basil may also work as a natural antihistamine. Heat a couple sprigs of basil leaves up under some steam and apply gently to the hives. Basil may help reassure the body that the foreign agent causing the hives is not something it should be fighting.",
                "If after all this, you still have some acne, consult a dermatologist. There are antibiotics and other oral acne medications that can target infected skin and clear it up very fast."

        "wikiHow to Treat Sunburn on the Face": {
            "intro": "Sunburns are painful. Worse yet, sun damage caused during childhood can lead to the development of skin cancer later in life.[1] Since the skin on your face is especially vulnerable and delicate, it is important to know how to treat and prevent a sunburnt face. Read on to learn more about how to detect, treat, and prevent a sunburn on your face.",
            "steps": [
                "Get out of the sun. As soon as you notice that your skin feels tingly or looks a bit pink, you should go indoors or at least get into the shade. It can take 4-6 hours after you get out of the sun for sunburn symptoms to appear. However, if you get out of the sun right away, you may be able to avoid a more severe sunburn. [2]",
                "Drink water. As soon as you notice symptoms of a sunburn, begin drinking water to rehydrate your skin.[3] Sunburns can cause dehydration and may lead to vasodilation, a process that can cause rapid dehydration and fatigue. You can help prevent after effects such as headaches by staying well hydrated.[4]",
                "Splash cool water on your face. If you face feels hot from a sunburn, you can cool it off by periodically splashing it with cool water and then gently pat it dry with a soft towel. You can also place a cold, wet washcloth over your forehead or hold it against your cheeks to help dissipate the heat. [5]",
                "Apply aloe or moisturizer to your face. Do not use any moisturizers that contain petroleum, benzocaine, or lidocaine. Instead, use pure aloe vera or a moisturizer that contains soy or aloe vera.[6] If your skin feels particularly irritated or swollen, you can also use an over the counter topical steroid cream (1% hydrocortisone cream).[7] Carefully read and follow the instructions on any over the counter medications that you use.[8]",
                "Take an ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen. Taking an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) painkiller as soon as you notice that you have a sunburn can help manage inflammation, discomfort, and pain. Read and follow the dosage instructions on the packaging carefully. [9]",
                "Inspect your skin. Once the sunburn’s effects have become noticeable, look closely at your skin to check the severity of your sunburn.[10] If you experience nausea, chills, vision problems, blisters over a large part of your body, or a fever, seek medical attention as soon as possible. [11]",
                "Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water to rehydrate your skin after a sunburn. Sunburns can cause dehydration, which can lead to headaches and fatigue. Water can help keep you hydrated, while sports drinks can help replenish lost electrolytes.[12]",
                "Moisturize often. Your skin will need to be moisturized frequently after a sunburn. Do not use any moisturizers that contain petroleum, benzocaine, or lidocaine.[13] Instead, use pure aloe vera or a moisturizer that contains soy or aloe vera.[14] If your skin feels particularly irritated or swollen, you can also use an over the counter topical steroid cream (1% hydrocortisone cream). [15]",
                "Don’t pick at blisters or peeling skin. Picking at blisters and peeling skin can cause permanent scarring of your skin.[16] If you notice any blisters or peeling, leave them alone and allow them to go away on their own. [17]",
                "Avoid the sun until your sunburn symptoms subside. If you must spend time outside, make sure that you are wearing an SPF 30 or 50 sunscreen and take advantage of any shady spaces that you can find. [18]",
                "Try a home remedy. There are lots of different household items that you can use to treat your sunburn naturally. Try one of these remedies to complement your other sunburn care techniques.[19]\n\nSponge lukewarm chamomile or mint tea on your face. Brew a cup of chamomile tea and let it cool down to room temperature. Dip cotton balls in the chamomile tea and dab the tea onto your face. [20]\n\nMake a milk compress.[21] Soak some gauze or a washcloth in cold milk and ring it out. Apply the cloth to your face. The milk will create a protective layer on your skin that will help to cool and heal your skin. [22]\n\nMake a potato paste to apply to your face. Cut up and blend a raw potato, then dip cotton balls in the pureed potato until they are soaked in the liquid. Dab your face with the soaked cotton balls [23]\n\nMake a cucumber mask. Peel and puree a cucumber, then apply some of the mixture to your face like a mask. The cucumber paste will help dissipate the heat in your skin.[24]",
                "Use sunscreen every day. Protect your face and the rest of your exposed skin by always wearing an SPF 30 or 50 sunscreen while you are outside. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before exposure and reapply once every 90 minutes. If you will be swimming or sweating, use a waterproof sunscreen. [25]",
                "Wear a hat while you are outside. A hat that has a wide brim (4 in.) will help protect your scalp, ears, and neck from sunburn. [26]",
                "Wear sunglasses. Sunglasses that have UV protection qualities will help prevent sun damage around your eyes. [27]",
                "Don’t forget about your lips! Your lips can get sunburned too, so always wear lip balm that has an SPF rating of at least 30. [28]",
                "Limit your time in the sun. If possible, limit your time outside during the hours between 10am and 4pm since sun exposure during this time is more likely to cause a sunburn. [29]",
                "Check your skin often. Monitor your skin while you are outside. If you notice that it is tingling or looking a bit pink, you probably have a sunburn and should get out of the sun right away. [30]",
                "Don’t trust an umbrella alone to protect your skin. Although an umbrella can help to reduce your direct sun exposure, sand reflects sunlight toward your skin so it is important to use sunscreen even if you are under an umbrella. [31]"

        "wikiHow to Break a Horse": {
            "intro": "In general, a horse's loyalty greatly depends on the type of training or breaking that it receives. Horses that are broken to follow their leader out of respect are much more enjoyable than those that follow out of fear. Follow these tips to build a bond of trust with your horse as you break it.",
            "steps": [
                "Gain the trust of your horse. Having a personal relationship with your horse is imperative in building trust with him, leading to training later on. Spend time with your horse everyday, starting with just being near him and grooming him. Grooming helps connect you with the horse and forms a bond between the two of you. Work around him in the pasture, giving him time to build confidence in you. Talk to him and reassure him if he is spooked by something.\n\n\nHorses are prey animals, so they get spooked easily. Your horse may be scared of people if he hasn't grown up with a lot of human interaction. [1]\n\nIf you have a foal or horse too young to be trained, go ahead and start getting the horse used to people and gaining his trust.\nYou should spend a significant amount of time gaining the horse's trust before starting to train him.",
                "Practice safety. Horses are powerful animals that can cause a lot of damage. While training your horse, you want to make sure you are safe. Stay where your horse can see you most of the time. If you have to move where he can't see you, run your hand along his side so he knows where you are going.\n\n\nThe best place to stand is on the horse's left side, aligned with his ear, angled towards his head. This spot is easiest for the horse to see you.\nTalk to your horse when you are out of his eyesight. This helps him know where you are.\nDon't walk behind your horse. Also don't stand directly in front of your horse.\nDon't kneel or sit around your horse. When working on hooves, bend down to work instead of squatting.[2]",
                "Take it one step at a time. Breaking a horse is a slow process. You have to fully make each step a habit before moving on to the next step. When you are training the horse, each new concept you introduce needs to build off what you have just taught him. Remember, you want the horse to fully develop a habit because otherwise, he won't be fully trained.[3]\n\nNever give up. Some steps may be easier than others for your horse. Breaking the horse is a big commitment.\nEnd each lesson on a success. Even if it's just a little bit of progress, like the horse letting you get the halter near its face, always end on a good note.",
                "Never get angry at the horse. Never scream at the horse, hit him, throw things, or act aggressively. This could scare the horse and break any trust you have built. Talk to the horse in a calm, low tone.[4]\n\nIf the horse disobeys you, correct it in a calm manner without showing aggression. Try using a \"shh\" sound to let the horse know he is doing something wrong.[5]",
                "Reward the horse for successes. Giving the horse positive reinforcement helps train the horse to do what you want. This includes giving him treats or stroking him. You can also use negative reinforcement. This includes a finger push or whip tap, if the horse isn't afraid of that. You can also try light lead, rein, or leg pressure.\n\n\nNever use negative reinforcement as a frightening or painful motion. They should be consistent and steady, not abrupt. Continue holding the negative reinforcement move until the horse corrects himself. Stop immediately after the horse does the right thing.[6]",
                "Get the horse used to your hands. The first way to start halter training the horse is to get him used to having your hands near his head, ears, and neck. Do this slowly. Stay within the horse's eyesight so you don't startle him. Reach out slowly. If you reach out too fast, he may misinterpret your action. Continue doing this until you can touch the horse.\n\n\nMake sure to give the horse verbal praise each time he improves. It might just be that your hand got closer to his face this time, or that he lets you touch him for a few seconds.\nReward the horse for each success by giving him treats.",
                "Get the horse used to the halter. Start by letting the horse see and smell the halter in your hands. For the first few days, simply keep it near him and allow him to see and smell it and recognize that it is not dangerous. Then, start slowly placing the halter over the nose and onto the head. At first, you may want to leave it on without buckling. When the horse gets used to that, then you can buckle the halter behind the ears.\n\n\nThis may take multiple attempts. Be patient and calm, trying to make a little bit of progress each day.\nLeave the halter on for a few days after you finally get it on.",
                "Introduce the bridle. Start by introducing the bridle to the horse along with the halter. Rub the bridle all over the horse's face gently. Try to get the horse to open its mouth for the bit. Be very gentle.",
                "Add the bit. In addition to halter breaking the horse, you will also have to break the horse into using the bit. Slowly introduce the bit into the horses' mouth. At first, only do this for a few minutes. Slowly build up to having the bit in the mouth for longer.[7]\n\nAdding a layer of molasses to the bit can help encourage the horse to put it in his mouth and make it more enjoyable.[8]",
                "Put the ear pieces on. Once the bit is in the horse's mouth without the horse fighting you, put the ear pieces over the ears. Do not fasten the straps yet.\n\n\nGradually work your way up to fastening the straps. Remember to let the horse get used to the feel of the bridle on its head and ears.",
                "Understand how to longe. Longing, or training with a rope, lets you lead a horse around an arena as you train it. When longing, make sure to use the largest circle you can. Circles that are too small can hurt the horse's legs, ligaments, and tendons. Make sure your circle has a minimum diameter of 60 feet.\n\n\nAs you start training the horse to longe, don't do it longer than 10 minutes in each direction. Build the horse up for longer sessions, because long periods of longeing can put a lot of strain on a horse's body. Longing should take around 15 to 20 minutes total.",
                "Train the horse from the ground. Before attempting to mount the animal, it is important to gain its trust with ground breaking. Attach a lunge line to the horse's halter.",
                "Make the longe line comfortable in the horse's mouth. If you hit the bit abruptly, you can make the horse uncomfortable. Making the horse's mouth uncomfortable or painful will make the horse fear longeing.\n\n\nMove your body with your horse so that the longe line has a steady contact. The horse will eventually accept this contact and walk in a circle to maintain that contact instead of pushing and pulling away.[9]",
                "Longe/lunge your horse. Longeing a horse is the process of showing leadership through working them in an arena. Spend time at least once daily longeing your horse. Use your body language to direct and speed them up. Eventually, build up the speed and intensity of longeing, until they can do a full canter, all while listening to your cues.\n\n\nYou may want to have a second person, preferably one who's familiar with horse behavior, stand behind you or otherwise near you as you longe, moving with you. Whenever your horse tries to turn inwards, have them walk towards it until it returns to its circle.\nYou should never touch your horse while longing; all cues should be given through changes in energy and body position, or with swinging the end of your longe line.\nLongeing is a trust exercise; every time your horse does as you ask, break eye contact and release the pressure you're applying.",
                "Train the horse to follow your commands. Teach the horse to properly walk beside you while leading it with a lead rope. As the horse moves in the circle around you, you need to teach it voice commands. Introduce the horse to the words: \"halt,\" \"stand,\" \"walk,\" and \"back.\" Make sure that you train the horse to understand \"halt\" and \"walk\" before doing anything else. Then, you can start introducing them to other faster commands, like \"trot.\"\n\n\nTry using \"wait\" instead of \"halt.\" The words \"halt\" and \"trot\" can sound very similar, and might confuse some horses.[10]\n\"Woah\" should be reserved for riding, to tell the horse to slow under saddle.",
                "Teach the horse to respect your space. Horses will test you when you are lead training them. They may try to shoulder you out of their space to see who the leader is. You must assert that you are the leader. When the horse moves too close to you, place pressure on the horse's ribs about a foot behind the shoulder. This is where the lead horse in a herd would discipline the horse. The horse will move sideways and give you space.",
                "Teach the horse to respond to pressure. The horse should learn how to respond to pressure on the halter. Attach the lead rope to the halter. Stand to the near (left) side of the horse, standing parallel to it, looking straight (as it should be). Hold the lead a few inches below the clip. Pull the lead to the right, away from you, and the horse should eventually give in to it and turn its head to the right. Immediately release the pressure and use positive reinforcement.\n\n\nAlternatively, stand on the right side of the horse. Pull the lead rope to the right to apply pressure. The horse should learn how to turn his head towards you from that command.\nRepeat for turning left, doing the same things as for the right except pulling in the direction that you are.\nDo the same thing for forward and backward by applying pressure on the halter in the correct direction.\nThe horse will learn to follow the pressure to release the pressure.",
                "Introduce the saddle. A horse must become familiar with the weight and sound of a saddle on its back. Just like with a halter and bit, spend a few days getting the horse used to the sound of the saddle, how it smells, and how it looks.\n\n\nAfter the horse is used to the sight of it, hold the saddle over the horse's back without touching.[11]",
                "Place the saddle pad (English) or saddle blanket (Western) on the horse. After the horse has gotten used to the saddle, place the saddle pad/blanket on the horse's back. Leave it on for just a few minutes. Then, if the horse responds well, take it off. Repeat several times. Do this on both sides so the horse gets used to you doing this from both sides.\n\n\nIf the horse becomes very frightened, more than is controllable, quickly remove the saddle pad/blanket and start again when it's less stressed.\nWhether English or Western, if the horse's saddle fits less than perfectly, and you plan on showing it or otherwise want it to look 'prettier', you may want to introduce both, as a saddle blanket provides little comfort for the horse, but is available in pretty patterns and colors, while a saddle pad provides comfort (hence 'pad'), but is not as pretty. If the saddle fits perfectly, the saddle pad is optional.",
                "Place the saddle on the horse. Slowly introduce the saddle onto the horse. Make sure to give the horse a lot of reassurance by talking to it and stroking it.[12] Leave it on for a few minutes, then remove it. Do this from both sides of the horse.\n\n\nMake sure you remove the stirrups and leathers while saddle breaking a horse.",
                "Fasten the girth on the horse. Do this very slowly. Tighten the girth little by little each day, especially if the horse seems skittish. If the horse seems too scared, stop and keep getting it acclimated to the tack.\n\n\nWhen your horse allows the girth to be tightened all the way, lean gently on the horse's back.",
                "Get the horse used to stirrups. Next, longe with the saddle on and the stirrups down. This helps the horse get used to things by his sides and legs.[13] Also start placing the leathers back onto the saddle.\n\n\nDo this slowly. Only introduce one new element at a time. Let the horse lose his fear of the item before introducing him to something new.[14]",
                "Longe with the saddle. When the horse can wear the saddle for longer periods, start longeing around the arena with the saddle in place.",
                "Prepare the horse for your mount. Until this point, the horse has likely only seen you at or below eye level. Move the horse near a fence post crossing. Climb up on the post and stand at a height so that you are above the horse's head.",
                "Introduce weight onto the horse's back. Get an experienced rider to help you introduce the horse to the weight of a rider on its back. First, leg the rider up and get him to lie across the saddle. He needs to lower his weight on to the horse gently so you don't spook the horse.[15]\n\nWhen the horse accepts this, stroke him and reward him.",
                "Get on the horse's back. The rider should slowly and gently place his left foot in the stirrup. Keeping the weight on the horse's back, ask the rider to swing the right leg over the horse's back, making sure the rider doesn't kick the horse. Then the rider should place his foot in the right stirrup.[16]\n\nRemind the rider to stay low as the sight of the rider on the horse's back will spook him. Get the rider to hold on tight to the saddle, but not to grip the reins tightly because if the rider is bucked off this will spook the horse even more.",
                "Walk the horse slowly. With the rider on his back, walk the horse around slowly, gradually moving further away from the animal.\n\nAsk the rider to collect the reins and start making contact with the horse's mouth, gently as not to spook the horse. Get the rider to slowly ask the horse to walk on using the verbal command and a gentle squeeze.[17]",
                "Try mounting. After having an experienced rider mount the horse, you need to mount the horse. Mounting your horse for the first time can be very dangerous, and should not be done without the supervision of a skilled horse-person or trainer. Carefully get on your horse, being sure not to kick or pinch him in the tack. Have the horse walk out for a few strides, stop, and dismount.\n\n\nSlowly build up the time you are in the saddle over a period of several weeks or months. Do not attempt to increase the speed until your horse is 100% comfortable with you while walking.\nIt may take a full year or longer before you can trot and canter on your horse. Don't rush the process, as it could train your horse to be fearful or to have bad habits."

        "How to Dry Hydrangeas": {
            "intro": "There are approximately 23 varieties of hydrangeas, which yield a diverse range of colors in shades of white, pink, blue, and lilac. Whether your flowers come from a florist or are grown in your garden, you can extend the beauty of your hydrangeas by drying them. This article provides instructions on how to dry hydrangeas using three different methods: silica gel drying, water drying, and pressing.",
            "steps": [
                "Select hydrangeas to dry. To keep the color of most hydrangeas, it's best to start the drying process when the flowers first bloom. Cut or buy fresh, recently opened hydrangeas on the morning you plan to start the drying process.\n\nPee Gee Hydrangeas however, look better when left to mature. Take these at different times of the season. They start out a pale green, then as they mature, some pink shows up, later turning to burgundy, and finally a chocolate brown color very late in late fall.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Dry Hydrangeas Step 1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Dry-Hydrangeas-Step-1.jpg/aid1330107-v4-728px-Dry-Hydrangeas-Step-1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Prepare the flowers for drying. Remove discolored parts and extra leaves, so the flowers are in good shape for drying. Cut the stems down to and or inch 2 (2.35 to 4.7 cm) from the base of the flowers.",
                "Prepare the drying container. Choose a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid to use for drying your flowers. Deeper containers work better than shallow ones, since the flowers will need to be completely submerged in silica gel.\n\n\nPour a thin layer of silica gel in the plastic container. The gel should completely cover the bottom of the container.\nErr on the side of pouring in too much gel to keep the flowers from being crushed against the bottom of the container.",
                "Place the blooms in the container. Take each bloom by the stem and carefully place it bloom-side down into the container. Add as many blooms as will comfortably fit in the container without touching each other or the container's sides.",
                "Add more silica gel. Place enough silica gel in the container to completely surround and support the hydrangeas.\n\n\nHold each flower steady with one hand and sprinkle the gel with the other until the flowers can stand up on their own and are covering the petals and stems. Fill the container with gel until it rises 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) above the blooms in addition to covering the stem.\nIf the container is narrow and very deep, you can suspend a flower at the bottom, cover it with silica gel, and add another bloom above it. Just make sure the container is deep enough that the flowers don't touch each other.",
                "Start the drying process. Put a lid on the container. Place it in a corner or a closet to allow the drying process to commence.\n\n\nWrite the date you submerged the flowers on the container, so you know when it's time to take them out.\nLeave container undisturbed for 4 days. Drying hydrangeas any longer in silica could result in brittle blooms that could shatter.",
                "Remove the blooms from the container. After 4 days, they should be completely dry.\n\n\nOpen the container and slowly pour the contents onto newspaper. Remove the dry hydrangea blooms and gently tap them to remove any loose silica.\nSave the silica gel in a plastic container for the next time you want to dry flowers.",
                "Store or display the dried hydrangeas. Carefully store the dried hydrangea blossoms in plastic bags until you're ready to use them or place them in a vase.",
                "Prepare the flowers for drying. Remove all but a few leaves, and discard discolored petals. Cut the flower stems to your desired length.",
                "Fill a vase or container with a couple inches of water. Place the flowers stem-side down into the vase, so the stems are submerged at the end of the stem.",
                "Allow the flowers to dry. Your hydrangea will slowly dry as the water gradually evaporates.\n\n\nPlace the vase out of direct sunlight, since strong sun can cause the flowers to shrivel or fade.\nDon't top off the water, since this may cause the flowers to mold before drying.\nThe drying process should take one to two weeks.",
                "Remove the dried flowers. Trim the stems if they are moist or discolored from being submerged in the water. Store the flowers in a plastic bag or place them in a vase and display.",
                "Prepare the flowers for pressing. Pressing flowers preserves the color and shape of the petals, but the shape of the hydrangea blossom itself will be flattened.\n\n\nCut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape.\nCut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried.",
                "Prepare the press. A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts. Remove the top piece of plywood and lay a piece of cardboard followed by two sheets of parchment or pressing paper on the bottom piece of plywood.\n\n\nThe cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press.\nThe bottom sheet of parchment paper is called the \"blotter.\" It absorbs moisture from the drying flower and is switched out every few days. The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process.",
                "Lay the flowers on the top sheet of parchment paper. Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect.\n\n\nA little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly.\nIf you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers.",
                "Finish assembling the flower press. Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second \"blotter\" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts.",
                "Allow the flowers to dry. Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin.\n\n\nOpen the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones.\nAfter a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press.",
                "Lift the pressed flowers from the parchment paper. They are now ready to use in craft projects such as cards or jewelry. Pressed flowers also look beautiful mounted on a card and framed."

        "How to Train a Belgian Malinois": {
            "intro": "A Belgian Malinois is a herding type of dog. It has similar attributes to a German Shepherd dog but is more agile in the sense that its body conformation is a perfect rectangle.[citation needed] If you want to really train a Belgian Malinois, you need to start it young, which is about 2 to 3 months old. Each training session will only take 30 minutes to 1 hour per day. The dog can be trained until it reaches 2 years old.",
            "steps": [
                "Train from the beginning. After you take the puppy out from its nest, you have to immediately introduce it to paper training.  Have it smell all the areas in your house. Have ample fresh water for it to drink.  \n\n\nAdd to the training the crate.  It needs to know where its going to sleep every day.  Make the puppy understand that his place is the crate and not your couch or your room.  \nUse only a leather collar leash instead of a choke collar.\nBuy toys for the puppy and have it play after every training session.",
                "Hold the dog by its nape during the training sessions. This is trying to establish that you are the alpha instead of it.",
                "Feed the puppy the same time each day and three times a day.  Keep a record notebook of the training sessions and the routines that you do each day.",
                "Introduce the puppy to varying activities and sites. For example, bring it to the marketplace, ride a bicycle and have the puppy tail beside you. Make it accustomed to different noises, like trumpets, toy guns, radio, vacuum cleaner and many more. After a month of paper training, introduce it outside the house and have it pee and poop there.\n\n\nDo this every morning, noon and evening after dinner.  You need to do this routine every day, until it learns the trick.",
                "Teach the dog to sit. When you want to make the puppy sit, just push its rear down while you are holding the leash and at the same time saying the word sit. In this way, it will learn that you want it to sit.  \n\n\nAbout 10 to 15 repetitions will do the trick.\n Of course, you need to reward it every time the dog does the right job, like giving it treats such as food or affection.  \nDo this routine everyday for ten days until the puppy knows what it needs to do.",
                "Introduce the down command once the sit command has been mastered.  First ask the dog to sit. Then push it down at the same time saying the word Down. Keep repeating this routine for a maximum of 30 minutes. Do it again in the afternoon.  \n\n\nKeep in mind the positive reinforcement technique by saying \"Good boy/girl\" when it does the right thing.  \nAlways record your progress in your small notebook. Also record the places that have been introduced to the puppy.",
                "Keep the dog groomed. A well-groomed dog is a happy and healthy dog. You need to bathe your puppy every week. Use the proper shampoo for the dog, introduce anti-lice powder, and dry it properly with a dryer and dry sheets every time. Clean its paws too, as well as its mouth and ears.  \n\n\nUse clean cotton balls wet with a little water and rubbing alcohol and rub it gently on its inner ears.  \nInspect the body the head and the front and hind legs.  Also inspect its eyes.",
                "Have a toilet break. After bathing have it pee outside the house.  Walk it around for awhile until its body is sun dried.",
                "Just leave when you need to leave, no need to caress the dog during that time.  When you arrive home from work just go inside the gate and into the house but don't caress it, to avoid the jumping actions. Instead, have the dog sit and pet it about three time and let it down.  This is enough. Or, if you brought home some treats, this is the right time to give the dog the treat when it is in the down position.",
                "Make it clear that your mealtime is separate from the dog's. As this dog is a work in progress, you need to teach your Belgian Malinois that it is not proper for it to stand in front you while you're eating your meal.  Instead, have it in the down position near the doorway while you and your family are having your meals. Don't give any food during this time.\n\n\nAlways have the dog in the down position facing the doorway. This will enforce discipline for your Belgian Malinois. When taught properly, every Belgian Malinois will eventually become the apple of its owners' eyes.",
                "Observe your Belgian Malinois every day for basic health. Note how it is walking, the way the dog eats. If anything out of the ordinary shows up, or if there is a manifestation of sickness, go to the veterinarian immediately and have the dog checked. This avoids further complications later on.",
                "Treat parasite infections. You need to have the dog deloused every month and dewormed every six months.  This is proper health management.  Lice infestation, especially in the ears, will develop into hematomas and will cost you a lot afterwards.  This could also destroy the erectness of its hears, once the hematomas develop, you won't see the erect ears anymore."

        "How to Process Loans": {
            "intro": "As a loan processor, you put together information about a borrower and organize it in a neat package so the underwriter can evaluate and approve the requested mortgage. You'll open the loan file, verify the borrower's information, and submit the package to the underwriter for an ultimate decision. Although specific steps may vary depending on your employer and any federal, state, or local laws, the basic steps to process a loan are roughly the same. [1]",
            "steps": [
                "Contact the loan officer. The loan officer acts as the intermediary between you and the borrower, and they can answer any questions you have about the loan. If you have any questions about the information, the loan officer can answer them.[2]\n\nRead through the application and other documents received first to make sure you understand everything about the loan before you get started with the processing. If you have any questions, it's better to ask them as soon as possible.",
                "Enter loan information into the computer system. The bank or lending company where you work will have its own system for entering information about each loan you process. Enter the information you've received accurately and completely.[3]\n\nIf the computer system prompts you for information you don't have in the loan file you received, contact the loan officer as soon as possible so you can get this information filled in.\nThe computer system will generate deadlines for various processing steps to be completed, and may send you reminders when a deadline is approaching.",
                "Order the borrower's credit report. If the borrower was pre-approved, the loan officer may already have pulled the borrower's credit report and included it in the information sent to you. If not, you'll have to order one.[4]\n\nYou may need a credit report from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. If the loan officer only checked one, you may still need to order the other two.",
                "Order an inspection or appraisal. The mortgage company may require an inspection or appraisal of the property being purchased before the loan can be approved. Depending on your employer's rules, it may be your responsibility as a loan processor to order these.[5]\n\nSince inspections and appraisals can take time, if you know you need to order them, do so as soon as possible during processing.\nThe underwriter will review the inspection and appraisal to determine the value of the collateral for the loan. Some states may have additional requirements, such as certification that there are no termites on the property.[6]",
                "Start a title search. The title search for the property will reveal whether there are any outstanding liens or other claims against the title, which could affect the value of the property.[7]\n\nIt's possible that the loan officer has already set the wheels in motion for the title search, or you may be responsible for handling this on your own.",
                "Check the borrower's income sources. The borrower's income is perhaps the most important part of their loan package, because it determines their ability to pay back the loan. Typically you'll be looking at the borrower's tax returns or pay stubs going back a couple of years.[8]\n\nThe borrower's education and employment history can be just as important as the amount of their income.\nFor example, if you have a borrower in their mid-20s who just graduated with a professional degree and has started working full-time in that field, their income probably will increase as they gain experience in their field.\nYou may need additional information to verify the borrower's income if they are self-employed. Request this information as soon as possible to avoid any unnecessary delays.",
                "Evaluate the borrower's assets. The borrower may have other property that either could generate income on its own or could be liquidated to pay debts if necessary. The value of these assets will affect the amount of the loan that gets approved.[9]\n\nAssets are particularly important if the borrower has limited or fixed income, perhaps because they're retired.\nWhen assessing value here, take into account whether the borrower has used that property as collateral on another loan.",
                "Analyze the borrower's outstanding debts and credit history. The borrower's credit report provides a snapshot of how that borrower handles credit. Compare their outstanding debt to their income, and check for missed payments.[10]\n\nYour employer will have basic standards that must be met. If the borrower doesn't meet these standards, they may need to provide additional information. For example, if a borrower has an unacceptable number of late payments on their report, the lender may require an explanation.",
                "Get proof of insurance. All lenders require borrowers to prove that they have homeowner's insurance, or can get homeowner's insurance for the property. Your employer will have set coverage standards that must be met.[11]\n\nHomeowner's insurance protects the property, which is being used as collateral for the loan. While the homeowner is still paying their mortgage, the insurance protects the lender as well as the homeowner from loss.\nIf proof of insurance wasn't submitted with the original loan application, work with the loan officer to get documentation from the borrower.",
                "Review the file. Before you send the file off to the underwriter, take a moment to look through all the information and documents in the file and make sure everything is complete and accurate. Check for errors and contact the loan officer if you need clarification on anything.[12]\n\nAs you review the file, note any possible red flags or other cause for concern. This saves the underwriter some time as they go through the file.\nMake sure the file follows the underwriter's formatting and organization guidelines. If documents or information are presented in the wrong order, it could impact the loan's approval.",
                "Request any additional reports of documents. The underwriter requires specific documents and information in each loan file. If you found missing documents in your review, contact the loan officer as soon as possible.[13]\n\nIf you've found any red flags, you also might want to get the borrower to explain them. For example, suppose the borrower missed three payments on a car and had it repossessed. The borrower may be able to provide information that would help excuse them for that fault.",
                "Forward the loan package to the underwriter. Once you're satisfied that everything in the loan package is complete and in an acceptable form, it's ready to move on to the underwriting process.[14]\n\nYou may be required to send the package through a supervisor first, who will review your work and point out any changes that should be made. This is especially likely if you're just starting out as a loan processor.",
                "Work with the underwriter to resolve any problems. The underwriter may issue a \"suspense\" on the loan if they require more information for processing. They may go directly to the loan officer for this information, but frequently as a loan processor you will act as an intermediary between the underwriter and the loan officer.[15]\n\nIn some cases, such as if the issue is related to a note or comment you made on the file, the underwriter may go to you directly for an explanation."

Don't worry, though, you can take steps to prevent danger while you're at home, as well as learn what to do if an emergency does happen.",

                "Follow your parents' rules. Your parents want you to stay safe. That's why they have rules. If you're not sure what the rules are, sit down with your parents and write out a list together, so you both have something to refer to.[1]\n\nThe rules might cover who you can have over (if anyone), whether you can go outside, and whether you can take phone calls.",
                "Lock the doors and windows. While break-ins are unusual, they can happen. The best thing you can do is keep the doors and windows locked when you're inside. That way, someone can't just walk in without your permission.[2]\n\nIf your family has an alarm, learn how to set it so it can protect you while you're home.",

If the person is delivering a package, ask them to leave it or come back later. Don't tell them you're by yourself.[3]\n\nIt's also important not to tell people over the phone that you're by yourself at home. If someone calls for your parents, you can say, \"They can't come to the phone right now. Can I have them call you back?\"",
                "Stay away from dangerous items in the house. Even though you're home alone, you don't have free rein to do anything you want. You still need to stay away from dangerous things. Don't play with matches, knives, or guns, for instance. Also, don't take medications unless you know what you're doing. Don't mix chemicals and cleaners you find around the house, as it can create fumes or liquids that can hurt you.[4]",

They can walk you through the situation so you feel safe again.\n\n\nIt's best to know your parents' cellphone numbers by heart, so you'll always be able to call even if you can't see the list of emergency numbers.",
                "Have emergency numbers ready. If something happens, you need to be ready. The main emergency number you need to know is 9-1-1 (in the United States). They can help with emergencies like fires, someone breaking in, or injuries. But you should only call them when it's truly an emergency. If you get a small cut, that's not a reason to call 9-1-1.[5]\n\nKeep other emergency numbers on hand, such as your parents' numbers, as well as other people you can call if you have an issue, such as a neighbor or family member.\nIf you don't have these numbers handy, ask your parents to make a list and post it up for you to see easily.[6]",
                "Practice what to say during an emergency call. When you call 9-1-1, the operator will want to know a few things. They'll want to know where you are (your address) and what's wrong. They'll also want to know your phone number so they can call back if needed. Try running through a practice call with your parents.[7]",
                "Run through practice emergencies with your parents. If something crazy happens, you may want to panic. Most people do. It's important to stay calm, though. One way you can learn to stay calm is to go over what to do when things happen with your parents.[8]\n\nThings can go wrong in a house, such as a toilet overflowing, the smoke alarm going off, or something catching on fire in the kitchen. Ask your parents to go over potential problems with you.",
                "Learn where the emergency exits are. You need to be able to know how to get out of your house in different ways. Of course, the back and front doors are good options. If there's a fire, though, you may need to escape through a window to get to safety.[9]\n\nAsk your parents to go over the best ways out of the house.",
                "Learn the basics of first aid. If you're at home alone, you need to know how to deal with getting a cut or a burn. If you have a bad cut or burn, you can call 9-1-1, but if you're only a little hurt, you can fix it yourself.[10]\n\nFor instance, for a cut, wash your hands, then hold a clean cloth against it to stop the bleeding. Rinse out the cut with cool water. Use antibiotic ointment, and then put a bandaid over it.[11]\n\nFor a bruise, prop the area up on a pillow. Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to help ease the swelling. Don't keep ice on it for more than 10 minutes.[12]\n\nWith a light burn, put it in cool, running water for about 10 minutes. Don't use ice. When it feels a little better, you can use aloe vera gel on it.[13]\n\nAsk your parents where your first aid kit is. If your home doesn't have one yet, buy one, or put one together with your parents.",

It's better to stay safe. Go to a neighbor or friend's house and call 9-1-1. You can even go back to school if you need to.[14]",
                "Don't let people you know in if it doesn't feel right. Even if you know an adult who's knocking on the door, you don't have to let them in if it doesn't feel right. Sometimes, even adults you know may not have good intentions. Trust your gut, and call your parents if you're not sure.[15]\n\nSome families have code words, so if your parents send someone to help that you don't know, you'll know it's okay. Then you can ask for the code word if someone says your parents sent them.",
                "Check out strange noises. Of course, many houses make odd noises from time to time, usually because the house is settling. However, if you hear a noise that's out of the ordinary, you should check it out. If you notice signs of trouble, take action.\n\n\nFor instance, if you notice signs of someone breaking in, get out of the house if you can and run to a neighbor's for safety.",
                "Pay attention to warning signs. Your home is likely equipped with both smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. When these go off, don't ignore them. If you don't know what to do, it's best to get out of the house, and dial 9-1-1 at a neighbor's house.[16]\n\nIf you notice that something is smoking, it's likely time to call 9-1-1 so the fire department can help you. You can try to work a fire extinguisher if your parents have shown you how to use one. However, if the fire is more than a very small one, get out of the house.\nAlso, if your house has a gas stove or heater, always pay attention to gas smells. The carbon monoxide detector should warn you, but it's always best to get out of the house if you smell gas. Natural gas has an additive to make it smell like rotten eggs."

        "How to Buy a Second Home": {
            "intro": "People have various reasons for wanting to buy a second home; some may want a vacation getaway, some are seeking rental income and others want to purchase a \"fixer upper\" for their retirement years. If you are thinking of buying a second home for any reason, you should weigh all the pros and cons before you commit yourself to another mortgage.",
            "steps": [
                "Look at the market for buying. Are homes cheap right now or expensive? Try searching for a graph of household income to home prices and see whether the city in which you're searching has a high ratio relative to other cities.[1] Note that some cities like New York and San Francisco may be historically immune to such ratios.\n\n\nTalk with a real estate agent, or several agents, about the relative price of homes. Even if you don't get a definitive answer (it's tough to gauge whether the housing market is cheap or expensive, as the information is not always clear), you may get leads on specific markets to watch for or even homes that are steals. This information is valuable.",
                "Assume that you won't be able to rent your second home. Is a second home still a safe investment without rent padding the list of expenses? If it's not, you should seriously question buying a second home. Too many families buy a second home that's too expensive, betting that they'll be able to rent when they're not occupying the second home. When renting becomes unfeasible, impossible, or generates much less than anticipated, the homeowners are left with a failing investment.",
                "Make a list of possible expenses. Add up all the likely expenses of owning a home. Can you fit these expenses into your budget with room to spare? Yes, you'll be building equity in your second home, but if investing in a second home leaves you severely cash-strapped each month, you may be better off waiting until you've paid off your first mortgage, for example. Here are some likely expenses to consider:\n\n\n\nProperty taxes. Different from state to state; the average annual property tax in Los Angeles is $1,200 for a $100k home, or 1.2%.[2] If property taxes are inordinately high in the town you are considering, investigate the mill rate (real estate taxes) in neighboring towns. You could save a lot of money in real estate taxes simply by purchasing a home in a town close to your preferred location that doesn’t have a high tax burden.\nBasic utilities. These should be much lower if the house goes unoccupied for large portions of the year, but should not go overlooked.\nUpgrading/upkeep expenses. A house is a living thing — it grows, gets old, needs assistance. Factor in the costs of regular renovations and upkeep services, such as landscaping. The yard and garden of a second home should be kept up if you have tenants, or if you are absent part of the year. In the summer months, overgrown weeds and uncut grass advertise that the property is unoccupied. In cold climates, an unplowed driveway and unshoveled walkways are invitations to vandalism or theft.\nIncreased insurance. The cost of insurance might be higher because the property will be vacant part of the year, or because you have tenants.\n\nProperty management services. A property management company should be a big cost factor in your calculations, especially if you buy a second home that is far away from your primary residence. If you rent out the property, you will have to make arrangements for someone to provide emergency repairs for your tenants. If you have a remote vacation home, you have to make sure someone can check for freezing pipes or leaks in the roof or any other possible damages to your home in your absence.",
                "Don't necessarily bank on the same tax credits you may have gotten for your first home. Check with the IRS to find out what the tax implications of a second home will be. For many people, the tax costs of owning a second home outweigh the tax credits, especially if you are living in the house for more days than you are renting it out.\n\n\nFor example, if you rent out your house for fewer than 14 days, you don't need to declare any earnings. If you occupy your house for fewer than 14 days in a year, your property is considered a business and up to $25,000 a year in losses can be deducted.[3]",
                "Consult a CPA or tax advisor before you go ahead and start looking for a second home. A CPA or tax advisor will be able to give you accurate, up-to-date information about tax write-offs, loans, interest rates, etc. For example, you can probably expect a more expensive mortgage, with a higher interest rate, regardless of your credit history — a second home usually just costs more to secure.",
                "Consider first renting in the area in which you plan to buy. A lot of people make the mistake of buying a property in a market which they know nothing about and which, at the end of the day, they end up not really caring for. Even if you plan on using the second home as an investment and renting it out, it should ultimately be a place where you could see yourself living, if only for a few weeks in the year. Rent for at least a little while in the area to make sure you're comfortable living there.",
                "Talk to locals and become one yourself. Find out what the locals like about the area; where they think it's heading; how long they've lived there, etc. Locals can give you great insight into how an area is doing. Use this information to determine whether buying a property in the area is a sound long-term investment.\n\n\nBecome a local yourself (while you rent for a spell) so that you can investigate some factors that will increase the value of your potential home:\n\nProximity to good schools\nReliable and extensive transportation options\nShopping options\nProximity to hospitals, as well as police and fire presence\nLow crime",
                "Look at what \"comps\" are selling for in the area. Comps, or comparable home prices, should give you a good idea about how expensive the average home is in your area. You may talk directly to real estate agents for comp data. The key to comps is looking at sale prices instead of listing prices.[4] Use comps as a rough guide — just because the 4 bed, 3 bath down the street sold for $575,000 doesn't mean the 4 bed, 3 bath you're interested in will.",
                "Start familiarizing yourself with the responsibilities of a landlord if you intend to rent. If you want to use your second home to rent out and build equity, it's necessary to know what's expected of you. Don't put yourself under legal fire by being lazy or willfully ignorant — it will come back to bite you. Here are just a few things you should start researching as a prospective landlord:\n\n\nKnow how to evict a tenant or terminate a lease.\nLearn your state's laws about security deposits, what they can — cleaning, unpaid rent, excessive damage — and can't — appliance upgrades, normal wear and tear, refurbishing — be used for.[5]\n\nKnow how to structure the rental application and tenant screening processes. Anti-discrimination laws legally oblige you to follow a protocol.\nKnow your duties when it comes to regular repair and maintenance.\nProtect yourself from liability when it comes to tenant injury. You are liable for any serious accident involving a tenant that was the tenant's responsibility to protect against or fix in a timely manner.[6]\n\nKnow the list of tenant's rights, especially concerning privacy. In most states, you must give the tenant 24 hours notice if you intend to fix or show the property, except in cases of emergency.[7]",
                "Get a real estate agent. A good real estate agent, one with at least 5 years of experience in the area you're searching, will be your advocate throughout the buying experience.[8][9] Agents will help you narrow down your housing search until you've weeded out all but the best fits. Then, after you've finalized your purchase, a good real estate agent will stay in touch with you after the sale. This becomes increasingly important for homeowners whose primary residence is far away from their second home.",
                "Secure financing before you decide on a home. Getting pre-qualified and then having the mortgage in tow will let you know what kind of house you can afford to buy. Since this will most likely be mortgage no. 2, expect to pay a higher interest rate on it, and possibly qualify for less. After you have your total budget fixed, set aside money for a down payment.\n\n\nIn order to get the prized second mortgage, lenders will often look for a debt to income (DTI) ratio of under 36%.[10] This means that your total debts, including your first mortgage, should only be about a third of the money that you bring in each month. For example, homeowners who take in $7,000 monthly and have $2,500 in debt have a DTI of 35%.\nBe prepared to put down 20% of the purchase price. This money will have to come from your personal savings or the equity in your current residence. You might also consider borrowing against your life insurance policy or your retirement fund.",
                "Make an offer. Make an offer on a second house that you like. Expect to make several offers that are ultimately outbid before you land one.",
                "Take steps to begin protecting your new home. Your second home is an investment, so you'll want to make sure you take pains to protect it. Here are couple things you can do to safeguard your newest asset:\n\n\nGet a home inspection prior to purchasing. You want to be aware of any lingering problems or damages a seller may not have disclosed before the sale.\nGet title insurance.\nGet hazard insurance (earthquake, flood, fire, etc.)"

            "intro": "HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the way that most web pages are edited for formatting decisions like alignment, paragraphs, bold and font size. If you are editing the HTML code for a web page, you can try 2 types of text editing: HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You can learn how to center text in HTML by learning basic HTML code and trying these methods.",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare to edit HTML web pages by learning the basics of HTML code.\n\nView the various tags you can use to change the font or formatting of text. For example, a small \"b\" in a bracket is used to identify bold text. A small \"i\" is used to identify italic text. Do not include the quotation marks in your code.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Center Text in HTML Step 1Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/95/Center-Text-in-HTML-Step-1Bullet1.jpg/aid2974143-v4-728px-Center-Text-in-HTML-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"505\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\" onload=\"WH.performance.clearMarks('image1_rendered'); WH.performance.mark('image1_rendered');\">\n\n\nPractice pairing tags. Most formatting tags require 2 tags, at the beginning and end of the text that you want to change. The first tag will include the letters or symbols of the tag in brackets (<>). The second tag will include a backslash before the tag. For example, you would put \"b\" in brackets at the beginning of the bolded text and \"/b\" in brackets after the bolded text.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Center Text in HTML Step 1Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Center-Text-in-HTML-Step-1Bullet2.jpg/aid2974143-v4-728px-Center-Text-in-HTML-Step-1Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"505\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",

Like any fiction genre, horror can be mastered with the right planning, patience, and practice.",
            "steps": [
                "Be aware of the subjective nature of the horror story. Like comedy, horror can be a difficult genre to write because what makes one person freak out or scream can leave another person bored or emotionless. But like crafting a good joke, crafting a good horror story has been done many times by the masters of the genre.[1] Though your story may not appeal to all readers, or elicit cries of terror, there will likely be at least one reader who will respond in horror to your story.",
                "Read several different types of horror stories. Familiarize yourself with the genre by reading effective examples of horror, from classic ghost stories to contemporary horror writing. As famed horror writer Stephen King once said, to be a real writer, you have to “read and write a lot.”[2] Think about ghost stories or urban legends told around a campfire when you were a kid or as well as any award winning horror tales you read in school or on your own. You may want to look at specific examples like:\n\n\n“The Monkey’s Paw”, an 18th century tale by William Wymark Jacobs about three terrible wishes granted by a mystical monkey’s paw.\n“The Tell-Tale Heart”, master horror writer Edgar Allen Poe’s psychologically disturbing short story of murder and haunting.[3]\n\nNeil Gaiman's take on the nursery rhyme of Humpty Dumpty in “The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds.”[4]\n\nYou’d be remiss not to read a horror story by arguably the master of the genre, Stephen King. He has written over 200 short stories and uses many different techniques to scare his readers. While there are many lists of his greatest horror stories ever[5], read “The Moving Finger”[6] or “The Children of the Corn” to get a sense of King’s style.\nContemporary writer Joyce Carol Oates also has a famous horror story called “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” that uses psychological terror to great effect.[7]",
                "Analyze the horror story examples. Choose one or two examples you enjoy reading or find interesting in terms of how they use a certain setting, plot, character or twist in the story to create horror or terror. For example:\n\n\nIn King’s “The Moving Finger”, King takes a premise: a man who thinks he sees and hears a moving human finger scratching a wall in his bathroom and then follows the man closely over the span of a short period of time as he tries to avoid the finger, until he is forced to confront his fear of the finger. King also uses other elements like a Jeopardy game and a conversation between the main character and his wife to further create a feeling of suspense and dread.\nIn Oates’ “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?”, Oates establishes the main character, a young girl named Connie, by providing scenes of her daily life and then zooms in on one fateful day, when two men pull up in a car while Connie is at home all alone. Oates uses dialogue to create a sense of dread and allows the reader to experience Connie’s growing sense of fear of the threat of these men.\nIn both stories, horror or terror is created through a combination of shock and dread, using elements that are possibly supernatural (a moving human finger) and elements that are psychologically disturbing (a young girl alone with two men).",
                "Think about what scares you or revolts you the most. Tap into your fears of losing family members, of being alone, of violence, of clowns, of demons, or even of killer squirrels. Your fear will then come across on the page and your experience or exploration of this fear will also grip the reader.[8]\n\nMake a list of your greatest fears. Then, think about how you would react if you were trapped or forced to confront these fears.\nYou could also take a poll of what scares your family, friends, or partners the most. Get some subjective ideas of horror.",
                "Take an ordinary situation and create something horrifying. Another approach is to look at a normal, everyday situation like taking a walk in the park, cutting up a piece of fruit, or visiting a friend and adding a terrifying or bizarre element. Such as coming across a severed ear during your walk, cutting up a piece of fruit that turns into a finger or a tentacle, or visiting an old friend who has no idea who you are or claims you are someone you are not.[9]\n\nUse your imagination to create a horrifying spin on a normal, everyday activity or scene.",
                "Use setting to limit or trap your characters in the story. One way to create a situation that will induce terror in a reader is to restrict your character’s movements so they are forced to confront their fear and then try to find a way out.[10]\n\nThink about what kind of confined spaces scare you. Where you would you dread or fear being trapped in the most?\nTrap your character in a confined space like cellar, a coffin, an abandoned hospital, an island, or an abandoned town. This will create an immediate conflict or threat to the character and set your story up with immediate tension or suspense.",
                "Let your characters restrict their own movements. Maybe your character is a werewolf who doesn’t want to hurt anyone on the next full moon so they lock themselves in a cellar or room. Or maybe your character is so fearful of a severed finger in the bathroom, he does everything to avoid the bathroom until the finger haunts him so much he forces himself to go into the bathroom and confront it.[11]",
                "Create extreme emotions in your reader. Because horror hinges on the subjective reaction of the reader, the story should work to create several extreme feelings in the reader, including:\n\n\nShock: the simplest way to scare the reader is to create shock with a twist ending, a sudden image of gore or a quick moment of terror. However, creating fear through shock can lead to cheap scares and if used too much, can become predictable or less likely to scare the reader.\nParanoia: the sense that something is not quite right, which can unnerve the reader, make them doubt their own surroundings, and when used to its full effect, make the reader doubt even their own beliefs or ideas of the world. This type of fear is great for slow tension-building and psychological horror stories.\nDread: this type of fear is the horrible sense that something bad is going to happen. Dread works well when the reader connects deeply to the story and begins to care enough about the characters to fear something bad that is going to happen to them. Inspiring dread in a reader is tricky as the story will need to do a lot of work to keep the reader engaged and involved, but it is a powerful type of fear.",
                "Use horrifying details to create horror or terror in your reader. Stephen King argues there are several key ways to create a feeling of horror or terror in a story, which can then create different reactions from the reader.[12]\n\nUsing gross out details like a severed head tumbling down a flight of stairs, something green and slimy landing on your arm, or a character landing in a pool of blood.\nUsing unnatural details (or fear of the unknown or impossible) like spiders the size of bears, an attack from the living dead, or an alien claw grabbing your feet in a dark room.\nUsing terrifying psychological details like a character who comes home to another version of him or herself, or a character who experiences paralyzing nightmares which then affect their sense of reality.",
                "Create a plot outline. Once you find your premise or scenario, your setting, determine which extreme emotions you are going to play on, and decide the types of horror details you are going to use in the story, create a rough outline of the story.\n\n\nYou can use Freytag’s pyramid[13] to create an outline, which begins with exposition of the setting and life or day of the character(s), moves into the conflict of the character (a severed finger in the bathroom, two men in a car), shifts upward into rising action where the character tries to solve or work against the conflict but meets several complications or roadblocks, reaches the climax, and then falls downward with falling action, into the resolution where the character is changed, shifted (or in the case of some horror), meets a terrifying death.",
                "Make your reader care about or identify with your main character. Do this by introducing clear details and descriptions of the character’s routine, relationships, and point of view.[14]\n\nDetermine the age and occupation of your character.\nDetermine the marital status or relationship status of your character.\nDetermine how they view the world (cynical, skeptical, anxious, happy-go-lucky, satisfied, settled).\nAdd in specific or unique details. Make your character feel distinct with a certain character trait or tick (a hairstyle, a scar) or a mark of their appearance (an item of clothing, a piece of jewellery, a pipe or cane). A character’s speech or dialect can also distinguish a character on the page, and make them stand out more to the reader.\nOnce your readers identify with a character, the character becomes a bit like their child. They will empathize with the character’s conflict and root for them to overcome their conflict, while also realizing that this rarely happens.\nThis tension between what the reader wants for the character and what could happen or go wrong for the character will fuel the story and propel your readers through the story.",
                "Be prepared for bad things to happen to your character. Most horror is about fear and tragedy and whether or not your character is capable of overcoming their fears. A story where good things happen to good people may be heartwarming but it will likely not scare or terrify your reader. In fact, the tragedy of bad things happening to good people is not only more relatable, it will also be full of tension and suspense.[15]\n\nIn order to create conflict in a character’s life, you need to introduce a danger or threat to the character, whether it's a moving finger, two men in a car, a mystical monkey’s paw or a murderous clown.\nFor example, in King’s “The Moving Finger”, the main character, Howard, is a middle aged man who enjoys watching Jeopardy, has a comfortable relationship with his wife, and seems to live a decent middle class life. But King does not let the reader get too comfortable in Howard's normal existence as he introduces a scratching sound in Howard's bathroom. The discovery of the finger in the bathroom, and Howard's subsequent attempts to avoid it, remove it, or destroy it, creates a story where a seemingly normal, likeable man’s life is interrupted by the unknown or the unreal.",
                "Allow your characters to make mistakes or bad decisions. Once you have established the threat or danger to the character, you will then need to have your character respond with the wrong move, while convincing themselves they are in fact making the right move or decision against this threat.[16]\n\nIts important to create enough motivation for the character so their bad decision feels justifiable and not merely stupid or unbelievable. An attractive young babysitter who responds to a masked killer by running not to the telephone to call the police but outside into the deep, dark woods is not only a stupid character move, it also feels unbelievable to the reader or viewer.\nBut if you have your character make a justifiable, though flawed, decision in response to a threat, your reader will be more willing to believe and root for that character.\nFor example, in King’s “The Moving Finger”, Howard initially decides not to tell his wife about the finger in the bathroom because he believes he may be hallucinating or confusing the scratching noise for a mouse or animal caught in the bathroom. The story justifies Howard's decision not to tell anyone about the finger by playing off what most people who tell themselves if they witnessed a strange or bizarre event: it wasn't real, or I'm just seeing things.\nThe story then justifies Howard's reaction by allowing his wife to go into the bathroom and not comment about seeing a moving finger by the toilet. So, the story plays with Howard's perception of reality and indicates that maybe he did hallucinate the finger.",
                "Make the stakes for the character clear and extreme. The “stakes” of a character in a story is what your character has to lose if they make a certain decision or choice in the story. If your reader doesn't know what is at stake for the character in the conflict, they cannot fear loss. And a good horror story is all about creating extreme emotions like fear or anxiety in the reader through creating extreme emotions in the characters.\n\n\nFear is built off of understanding the consequences of an action for a character or the risk of their actions. So if your character decides to confront a clown in the attic or two men in a car, the reader will need to be aware of what the character could lose as a result of this decision. Preferably, your character’s stakes should be extreme or major, such as loss of sanity, loss of innocence, loss of life, or loss of the life of someone they care about.\nIn the case of King’s story, the main character is afraid that if he confronts the finger, he may risk losing his sanity. The stakes of the character in the story are very high and very clear to the reader. So, when Howard does finally confront the moving finger, the reader is terrified of how the outcome is going to create a loss for Howard.",
                "Manipulate the reader but do not confuse them. Readers can either be confused or scared, but not both. Deceiving or manipulating your readers through foreshadowing, shifting character traits, or a revelation of a plot point can all work to build suspense and create anxiety or fear in the reader.[17][18]\n\nHint at the horrific climax of the story by providing small clues or details, such as the label on a bottle that will later come in handy for the main character, a sound or voice in a room that will later become an indication of an unnatural presence, or even a loaded gun in a pillow that may later go off or be used by the main character.\nBuild tension by alternating from tense or bizarre moments to quiet moments where your character can take a breath in a scene, calm down, and feel safe again. Then, amp up the tension by re engaging the character in the conflict and then making the conflict feel even more serious or threatening.\nIn “The Moving Finger”, King does this by having Howard freak out about the finger, then have a relatively normal conversation with his wife while listening to Jeopardy and thinking about the finger, and then attempt to avoid the finger by going for a walk. Howard begins to feel safe or assured that the finger is not real, but of course, once he opens the bathroom door, the finger seems to have grown longer and is moving much faster than it was before.\nKing slowly builds tension for both the character and the reader by introducing the threat and then having it overshadow the rest of the story. As readers, we know the finger is a sign of something bad or possibly evil, and are now in a position to watch Howard try to avoid, and then eventually confront this evil.",
                "Add a twist ending. A good twist in a horror story can make or break the story, so its important to create a twist ending that ties up many of the loose ends in the character’s conflict but still leaves one major question up in the air to tease the reader’s imagination.[19]\n\nWhile you want to create a satisfying ending for the reader, you also do not want to make it so closed and settled that the reader walks away without a lingering feeling of uncertainty.\nYou could have the character experience a moment of realization about the conflict or about how to solve the conflict. The revelation should be the result of a build up of details in the scene or story and should not be jarring or feel random to the reader.[20]\n\nIn “The Moving Finger”, Howard's moment of realization occurs when he figures out that the finger may be a signifier of an evil or wrong in the world. He asks the police officer, who is there to arrest him after noise complaints from the neighbors, a final Jeopardy question, in the category of the “inexplicable”. “Why do terrible things sometimes happen to the nicest people?” Howard asks. The police officer then turns to open the toilet, where Howard stored the slaughtered finger, and “wagers it all” before opening the toilet seat to look at the inexplicable or unknown.\nThis ending leaves the reader wondering what the officer sees in the toilet, and if the finger was real or a figment of Howard's imagination. In this way, it is open ended without being too surprising or confusing for the reader.",
                "Avoid cliches. Like any genre, horror has its own set of tropes and cliches that writers should avoid if they want to create a unique, engaging horror story. From familiar images like a deranged clown in the attic to a babysitter alone in a house at night, to familiar phrases like “Run!” or “Don’t look behind you!”, cliches are tricky to avoid in this genre.[21]\n\nFocus on creating a story that feels personally terrifying to you. Or, add a twist to a familiar horror trope, like a vampire who enjoys cake instead of blood, or a man trapped in a dumpster rather than a coffin.\nRemember that too much gore or violence can actually have a desensitizing effect on the reader, especially if the same pools of blood keep happening over and over again in the story. Of course, some gore is good and likely necessary in a horror story. But make sure you use gore in a spot in the story that is impactful or meaningful, so it can punch your reader in the gut, rather than numb them or bore them.[22]\n\nAnother way you can avoid cliches is to focus more on creating a disturbed or unsettled state of mind for your character, rather than images of gore or pools of blood. Pictorial memories often don’t stick in a reader’s mind, but the effect of these images on a character will likely create a lingering creepiness for the reader. So aim not for you reader’s imagination but for a disturbance in your reader’s state of mind.[23]",
                "Analyze your use of language. Go through the first draft of your story and look at sentences where you have duplicated adjectives, nouns or verbs. Maybe you have a preference for the adjective “red” to describe a dress or a pool of blood. But adjectives like “ruby, russet, crimson” can add texture to the language and turn a conventional phrase like “a red pool of blood” into a more interesting phrase, like “a crimson pool of blood.”\n\n\nGet out your thesaurus and replace any redundant word use with synonyms to avoid using the same words or phrases over and over again in the story.\nBe sure to make your language use and word choice fit the voice of your character. A teenage girl will likely use different words or phrases than a middle aged man. Creating a vocabulary for your character that fits their personality and perspective will only add to their believability as character.",
                "Read your story out loud. You can do this to a mirror or to a group of people you trust. Horror stories began as an oral tradition of spooking someone around a campfire, so reading your story out loud will help you determine if the pace of the story is building steadily and gradually, if there is enough shock, paranoia, or dread, and if your characters make all the wrong decisions until they are forced to confront the source of their conflict.\n\n\nIf your story is dialogue heavy, reading it out loud will also help you determine if the dialogue sounds believable and natural.\nIf your story contains a twist ending, gauging your reader’s reaction by watching your audience’s faces will help you determine if the ending is effective or needs more work."

            "steps": [
                "Have somebody in the boat use the boat motor to help push you out. Be sure the prop will not hit anything and that the boat is well attached to the trailer. Be sure to stop the boat motor as soon as the prop leaves the water.",
                "Get your boat off the trailer. (rarely do people have problems getting off the ramp once the boat is off the trailer.)",
                "Check to see if everything is ready for road travel, things like making sure your boat is properly locked to the trailer so it won't fall off while being towed.",
                "Get as much as you can into the bed of the truck for added weight over the rear wheels for better traction. People are a good help to sit in the bed right over the wheels. People have more weight than other things you'd usually have on hand.",
                "Again, put things right over the rear wheels if possible. SUVs already have more weight over the rear wheels because it's not just an open bed.",
                "Get in your vehicle and put it in drive while holding the brake so your vehicle won't go backwards into the lake.",
                "Slowly give the vehicle gas, still holding the brake just enough so you want roll backwards.\n\n\nIf your rear wheels start spinning try to get more weight in the back if possible.\nIf all else fails then you'll have to do a burnout to get the tires hot so they will stick to the ramp better.",
                "Put the car in 1st gear. On Automatic cars just put the Shift Handle all the way down to 1 or L in some cars.\n\n\nGive it gas and hold the brake a little too so you won't slide back into the water.\nGive enough gas to get the wheels spinning real fast but don't over rev your engine. Watch the RPM meter to make sure it doesn't redline.\nShortly your vehicle should start inching forward up the ramp. If you're still not moving then let off the gas and hold the brake. Then slowly give it gas trying not to burnout.\nIf all this fails then you'll need to find someone that's capable of pulling you out.",
                "Load up your boat.",
                "Make sure everything is ready for towing.",
                "Put your vehicle in 4WD. 4WDL will help too, it's a lower gear so it will help give you torque for climbing the ramp hill.",
                "Put the vehicle in drive and give it gas to get up the hill. If 4WD isn't enough, load as much as you can into the back of the vehicle for more traction and get as much weight out of the boat as you can so it will be easier to pull out."

        "wikiHow to Make a Relationship Last": {
            "intro": "Starting a relationship is always fun and exciting, but making a relationship last is hard work. Once you’ve gotten settled in your relationship, you have to maintain an honest flow of communication and to continue to cherish your time with your loved one. Making a relationship last isn’t always fun, but the benefits of maintaining a long-term and committed relationship far outweigh the difficulties that you may face. If you want to know how to make your relationship last, just follow these tips.",
            "steps": [
                "Make time for romance. Though “date night” may sound forced, you and your special someone should aim to have a date night at least once a week, if not more often. You don’t have to call it “date night” if that sounds too cheesy, but you should make a goal to spend some quality time together without anyone else around at least one night a week.\n\n\nYou can do this same thing during date night, such as cooking dinner together and then going to the movies, or spice it up and do something new every time. If you’re staying in, maintain a romantic atmosphere by lighting some candles and playing some soft music.\nWhatever you do, make sure you have time to really talk during your special time together. You won’t be able to talk much if you’re just going to a loud concert together.\nLearn to say no to others during “date night.” Your girlfriends may be begging you to come out to the bars, but if you’ve scheduled a date night, tell them you can’t make it and make plans for next week. Things will break down if “date night” is the thing you’re always willing to give up.\nYou should always look nice, tell each other how much you love each other, and compliment each other throughout the night.",
                "Make love at least once a week. You don’t have to plug this into your calendar, and hopefully you won’t have to, but you should make a conscious effort to make love at least one a week, no matter how tired you feel after work, or how much you have going on that week.\n\n\nMaking love is a way to maintain your intimacy and to grow closer to your partner.\nYou should also spend some time just cuddling and kissing each other, so you don’t feel like you’re just checking “sex” off of your to-do list.",
                "Make time to talk. Though your schedules may get crazy, you need to make a concerted effort to talk to each other every day, no matter how much work you have to do. You can set aside time to talk during dinner, or to talk over the phone if your loved one is away.\n\n\nMake a habit of knowing what your loved one’s day was like. Though you don’t have to bore each other with every little detail of your lives, you should become comfortable with each other’s routines.\nIf you’re spending a week apart, set aside at least fifteen minutes a day to catch up and to remind your loved one how much you love and miss him.\nWhen you do talk, there should be no distractions. You’re not really talking if you’re also watching the game or checking your phones.",
                "Be honest with each other. Honesty is the key to any long-lasting relationship. To keep your relationship strong, you should be able to be open and honest with your special someone. You should be able to share your most intimate thoughts and feelings with your loved one, or you’re not really communicating.\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to tell your loved one if he disappointed you. Being honest about your feelings will help you work through the problem, and is far better than being passive aggressive if you’re upset about something.\nShare your feelings with your loved one. If you’re really upset about something that happened at work or something your mother said, then don’t keep it all inside.\nKnow when not to say something. Though honesty is almost always the best policy, you don’t have to share every little feeling with your loved one. For example, if you don’t like his new shirt or think one of his new friends is kind of annoying, you may want to keep it to yourself.\nTime your honesty. If you want to open up about something important, make sure you do it when your loved one has time to talk and is relatively unstressed. Your news will be better received if he has time to listen.",
                "Learn to compromise. In any strong relationship, being happy should be more important than being right. If you want your relationship to last, then you should learn how to make decisions with your loved one, and to find a way for both of you to be happy with the decisions, or to take turns giving in to each other. Here’s how to do it:\n\n\nWhen you’re making a decision, have your loved one rate how important it is to him on a scale of 1 to 10, and then state how important it is to you. Then talk about why it’s so important to both of you, and what you can do to make it matter less.\nBe thoughtful. When the two of you are making a decision, take the time to discuss the pros and cons and what you can do to meet halfway.\nTake turns giving in on small decisions. If you picked the restaurant for date night, let your girl pick the movie.\nMake sure both people are compromising. It’s not a compromise if your girl is always giving in to what you want in the end because you’re more persistent.",
                "Learn to say you’re sorry. This is an important point. If you want to be in a long-lasting relationship, then you absolutely have to learn how to say you’re sorry from time to time. When it comes to a relationship, admitting you’re sorry is much more important than being stubborn.\n\n\nLearn to apologize if you’ve done something wrong. It may take you some time to realize that you made a mistake, but once you do, say that you’re sorry for what you’ve done.\nMake sure you mean it. Be sincere and make eye contact. It won’t mean anything if you’re just saying you’re sorry because you have to.\nLearn to accept your loved one’s apology. If he truly means it, then you should stop sticking to your guns, accept the apology, and move on.",
                "Tell your loved one how much he means to you. Don’t ever forget to say “I love you” and take your feelings for granted. You should tell your loved one that you love him every single day—multiple times a day, if you can. Remember that there’s a difference between “love you” and “I love you”—you should really mean it when you say it.\n\n\nAlways compliment your loved one. Tell her how great she looks in her new dress or how much you love her smile.\nAlways thank your loved one. Don’t take his/her favors and kind actions for granted.\nAlways tell your loved one how special he/she is. Don’t ever forget to make him feel unique.",
                "Find new interests to pursue together. A relationship is like a shark—if it doesn’t move forward, it dies. You should find ways of keeping your relationship fresh so your love doesn’t become just a part of your routine. One way of doing this is to find new interests that you can pursue together, so you have something to be excited about as well as a shared passion.\n\n\nTake a weekly dance class together. This will give you some great exercise and will increase your passion for each other.\nFind a new hobby together. Try taking a painting or ceramics class, or find a new love for sailing.\nTake a class together. Try learning a new language or taking a history class together.\nTrain for a race together. This is a great way to get closer, whether you’re training for a 5K or a marathon.\nDo anything out of your comfort zones. Try hiking, mountain biking, or even ice skating. Doing something completely unfamiliar will bring you closer together.",
                "Keep it fresh in the bedroom. If you want to maintain a healthy relationship, then you have to maintain a healthy sex life. Though your lovemaking may not be what it was in the beginning after five years together, you should still try new things in the bedroom so you’re still excited about making love with your partner and that everything you do still feels like an adventure.\n\n\nMake love in new positions. Don’t do the same old thing you’ve been doing, even if it works. You can even look up new positions together, which will be great for foreplay.\nMake love in new places. Don’t always go for the bedroom—try the couch, the kitchen table, or even check in to a hotel in the middle of the day.\nTry going to a sex store to pick up some kinky items to bring into bed.",
                "Take trip to a new place together. Though a vacation isn’t a good long-term solution to any relationship problems, taking a trip together can help take you out of your same old perspective and appreciate your love in a new way. Plus, planning a trip together will give you something new to look forward to.\n\n\nPlan the trip you’ve always wanted to take. If you’ve both been talking about going to Paris together for the last seven years and you have the funds for it, it’s time to make your dreams a reality.\nTake a short day trip. Even driving an hour out to spend a day in the woods or the beach can make your relationship feel fresher.\nTake a second honeymoon. If you’re already married and had a honeymoon, take another honeymoon to commemorate your love.",
                "Understand contextual behavior. Chances are that along with chemistry, you met your partner at a time that was conducive to your union. You may have been young with a strong sex drive, on a holiday, or shared a strong emotional experience together. This is an example of a positive contextual influence that improved your relationship.",
                "Accept contextual behavior. Accept the fact that negative contextual influences are unavoidable. When a person goes through a stressful period, a period of ill health, professional failure, or has other sources of anxiety then he or she could act in a way that is not consistent with the behavior of the person you know and love.",
                "Identify contextual behavior. If your partner is unsympathetic with you in a testing time, such as just following labor, being fired at work, or after a death in the family, then consider that it maybe not be him or her, but the situation that produces those words. Treat contextual influences like the weather. There is nothing you can do about them, other than to tolerate them.",
                "Forgive contextual behavior. Forget and forgive a person's behavior in difficult times. The human mind naturally favors negative experiences over positive ones. Grudges for what your partner said carelessly add up over time, and are are a sure way of making a relationship sour. Differentiating contextual behavior from personal behavior is an art that can help create healthy, lifelong relationships."

        "wikiHow to Clean a Front Load Washer": {
            "intro": "High-efficiency (HE), front load washing machines are easy to love because they require less water and detergent. However, these models require special procedures to clean and air out the components. If you find your front load washer smelling like a locker room, it’s time to clean it thoroughly and start using special maintenance procedures. Regularly clean the gasket and drum of the washer so that mildew doesn't grow. You should also learn how to keep your washing machine dry and clean between loads.",
            "steps": [
                "Locate the gasket. The gasket is the rubber ring that runs along the opening of your washer's drum. This is what creates a seal to prevent water from leaking out of your washing machine. Open the washing machine door as wide as you can and peel back the rubber that runs around the opening.\n\n\nThe gasket will remain fixed to the washing machine, but you can pull it open to clean it and make sure nothing is stuck.",
                "Remove any foreign objects. Once you've pulled back the gasket, check for any objects between the rubber. Sharp items can damage the gasket and the washing machine if you run the machine. Always check the pockets of you clothes and remove items before washing them.Common foreign objects include:[1]\n\nHair pins\nNails\nCoins\nPaper clips",
                "Check for dust or hair. If you notice hair in the gasket, this means that particles from your clothes are building up on the clothes. If you have pets or people with long hair in your household, you should check the gasket for hair at least once or twice a week. If the gasket looks dusty, you may need to occasionally keep the door on your washer closed. For example, if your dog will be crated in the laundry room overnight, keep the door closed.\n\n\nDust builds up on the gasket when dust or lint from your dryer or laundry room floats around and lands on the gasket. Cut back on dust particles in the air by regularly changing your lint trap.",
                "Clean any mildew. If you see black spots, your washing machine is growing mildew. This means that the gasket isn't getting dry enough between uses or your soap is leaving behind too much residue. This moisture causes the mold to grow. To remove mildew, spray down the gasket with hot soapy water or a mildew cleaner. Wipe the cleaner away using a clean cloth or rag.[2]\n\nYou may need several cloths if the gasket is slimy with mildew. Keep spraying and wiping until your cloth comes away clean.",
                "Deep clean the gasket once a month. To kill the mildew, add 1 cup of bleach into your empty machine and run a hot cycle. You should also pour 1/2 cup of bleach into the detergent or fabric softener compartment to ensure that your entire machine gets clean. After the cycle is done, run a few more cycles through without adding any bleach. This will remove the bleach smell from the machine before you wash clothes in your machine again.[3]\n\nIf you notice black mold on mildew spots after running your machine, you may need to put on gloves, a mask and scrub the spots using a bleach solution. Dip a toothbrush in a solution of no more than 10% bleach and scrub the mildew.[4]",
                "Sprinkle 1/3 cup (74g) of baking soda into the inside of the drum. Baking soda will help to remove any odors from mildew or dirty cloths. Close the door. Load two cups (473ml) of white vinegar into the detergent tray. The vinegar and baking soda will create a reaction that cleans the drum of your washing machine.[5]\n\nAlways check the instruction manual that came with your machine for specific cleaning recommendations.",
                "Turn your washer on. Set your washing machine to do a cleaning cycle (if you have that option). If not, set it to do a regular wash. Choose a high-temperature wash so that the baking soda and vinegar will have a chance to react. Let the machine run through a full wash and rinse cycle.[6]\n\nIf your HE washer has a cleaning cycle, the owner's manual will have specific instructions about when to add the vinegar and baking soda.",
                "Clean stains in a very dirty HE washer. If your machine is very smelly and you suspect mildew is growing inside the drum, run a cycle with bleach. Load two cups (473ml) of bleach loaded into the bleach dispenser. Run a wash and rinse cycle. To completely rinse out your machine, run another rinse cycle without anything in the drum.\n\n\nNever run a cycle with baking soda, vinegar, and bleach. These can create a dangerous reaction that could damage your machine.",
                "Remove and clean the detergent dispenser panel. Pop off the detergent dispenser panel and soak it in warm water. Remove the panel and spray it with all-purpose cleaner. Wipe it clean and pop it back into place.\n\n\nIf your machine has a fabric softener dispenser, you should clean and wipe its panel as well.",
                "Clean the outside of the washer. Spray a clean cloth or rag with multi-purpose cleaner. Wipe along all exterior surfaces of your washing machine. You'll wipe up any lint, dust and hair that can build up on the outside.\n\n\nKeeping the outside of your machine can prevent dust and dirt from getting into your machine.",
                "Use the right detergent. Purchase a detergent that's specifically designed for use in an HE machine. You should also use only the recommended amount of HE detergent (and fabric softener). If you use more detergent than is necessary, the detergent will build up on your clothes and on your machine.[7]\n\nDetergent buildup can create odor and cause mildew to grow.",
                "Remove your laundry right after it is done. Don't let your clean wet clothes stay in the washing machine for hours before switching them to the dryer. Mildew and odors develop more quickly in HE washers than top load models.[8]\n\nIf you can't switch the load of wet laundry, at least try to crack the door open so that the moisture isn't completely trapped in the washing machine.",
                "Dry the gasket in between loads. Ideally, you should take an old towel and completely wipe around the gasket after every load of laundry you wash. The goal is to remove all moisture from the gasket so mildew can't grow. Keep the door slightly open when you're done washing a load so that moisture evaporates from the machine.[9]\n\nYou should also dry the inside of the door, especially if you tend to keep the door closed.",
                "Remove and air dry the dispenser tray. While you should be in the habit of regularly cleaning the detergent dispenser panel or tray, get in the habit of at least removing it after each wash cycle. Take the dispenser tray out and let it air dry. This will also get air moving into the machine itself which can prevent mold growth.\n\n\nIf you're in the habit of removing the dispenser tray after each wash, you can quickly check it over for black mildew or stains that need to be cleaned."

        "wikiHow to Prevent Bed Bugs": {
            "intro": "Bed bugs are a growing concern since they’ve become more common in recent years and are extremely difficult to exterminate. While hotels are high on the list of bed bug concerns, any public place can be a haven for bed bugs. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to prevent a bed bug infestation in your home. By avoiding contaminated materials, avoiding bed bugs while traveling, and protecting your home, you can prevent bed bugs.",
            "steps": [
                "Replace your mattress and box spring every 2-3 years. While this may seem like a very short time to have a mattress, it may be a smart action to take in order to eliminate the problem at its source. Once bed bugs have gotten into your bed, it’s extremely difficult to tell how many are in there, figure out exactly where they are, and get them out. Additionally, bed bugs can linger in other areas around your home but they are most often going to be in your bed.",
                "Use protective covers on your mattresses and box springs. You can keep bed bugs from infecting your bed by encasing your mattress and box springs in a plastic protective cover. The bugs will have difficulty crawling under the elastic of the protective cover and cannot penetrate the fabric. While you may already have a protective cover on your mattress, adding one to your box springs will eliminate hiding places.[1]\n\nMattress protective covers are widely available at most stores that sell bedding, such as big box stores, home goods stores, and internet retailers.\nIf you do bring home bed bugs, your protective cover will make it easier to see the bugs quickly. First wash all of the clothing and other fabric that you travelled with, and then check the cover so that you can immediately recognize and address the problem.[2]\n\nIf bed bugs have already gotten into the mattress and box spring, it’s better to dispose of them immediately than try to remove the bed bugs.",
                "Vacuum carpets and rugs often. Vacuum at least weekly. If you suspect that you’ve come into contact with bed bugs, then vacuum daily until you’re sure that your home is clear.[3]\n\nDispose of the vacuum contents carefully in a plastic bag that you can seal, then remove from your home immediately.\nIf you do have bed bugs, failing to empty the vacuum cleaner can allow the bugs to spread.",
                "Use essential oils to repel bed bugs. There are several scent options for keeping away the bed bugs, so you just need to pick the one you like. Add 6-10 drops of pure essential oil to a small spray bottle filled with ¼ cup of water. Spray your scented water in your house and on items you take with you in public, such as your outerwear, handbags, totes, backpacks, and luggage.[4]\n\nEssential oils that repel bed bugs include the following: cinnamon, lemongrass, clove, peppermint, lavender, thyme, tea tree, and eucalyptus.[5]\n\nYou can make a repellant for your body if you mix the oil in a carrier oil, such as jojoba or grapeseed oil.[6]",
                "Clear out clutter. Clutter gives bed bugs a place to hide and makes it easier for the bugs to infest your home. It’s much harder to monitor for the presence of bed bugs if you can’t get to items or easily move them around. Minimizing the places where the bugs can hide is essential for keeping the bugs out.[7]",
                "Install door sweeps or door jams. If you live near other homes, such as in an apartment building or townhouse row, seal off your apartment by blocking the gap below your door. You can either install a door sweep or purchase a door jam that completely covers the open space. This will make it more difficult for the bugs to come into your home.[8]\n\nIf your home has cracks or other damage to the walls or ceiling, get these repaired so that the bugs can’t enter that way.",
                "Stay in top grade hotels. Most three, four, and five star hotels have fixed policies on how often they change out mattresses and pillows. Staying in a nicer, more expensive hotel won’t ensure a bed bug-free environment, but it definitely increases your chances.",
                "Check the bed, nightstand, and upholstered furniture for signs of bed bugs. Move the sheets and look in the crevices of the mattress and box springs. Look for reddish-brown bugs, small red spots, yellow skins, and egg casings, which look like tiny translucent sacks. Check seams and crevices of all furniture.[9]\n\nDon’t neglect the headboard and other wooden furniture near the mattress. Bed bugs can hide in the cracks.\nIf you find a bed bug, contact the front desk and leave immediately.\nYou may not always be able to see the bed bugs. Just because you can't find them doesn't mean they are not there. If you wake up and have developed an itchy rash, then bed bugs may be in your bed.",
                "Keep your luggage away from the bed. Even if you don’t find signs of bed bugs, it’s best to avoid placing luggage on the bed, even for a moment while removing items from it. Your luggage is the item most likely to carry bugs back from your trip and it’s the hardest to treat. Keeping it free of bugs will give you the best chance at preventing an infestation.[10]\n\nWhile you initially inspect the room, place your bag in the bathtub where it’s unlikely to pick up bugs.[11]",
                "Use the luggage rack. After you check it for contamination, move the luggage rack away from the wall and put your luggage on top of it.[12]\n\nIf there’s not a luggage rack, the bathroom and tub are the safest locations in the hotel room for you luggage.",
                "Unpack your suitcase outside. When you get home, avoid bringing in hitchhiking bugs by removing the contents of your suitcase outside. Place all clothes in plastic bags for immediate washing, and leave your suitcase outside until you’ve inspected it.[13]",
                "Wash your travel clothes separate from other laundry immediately. Include all of the clothes that you brought on your trip in your washing, not just the clothes you wore. Wash and dry the clothes on the highest setting that the fabric can withstand or take items to the dry cleaners.[14]\n\nUndress on a hard surface floor rather than on carpet if you suspect bed bugs are on your clothing. Wipe off the floor to capture any bed bugs that fall off the clothes.",
                "Run clothes and bags through the dryer on high heat. The heat from a dryer can kill bed bugs at any stage of their development. Washing alone won’t kill the bugs. To get the best results, wash the items in hot water and then dry them for 30 minutes on high heat.[15]",
                "Use cold to treat items that can’t be heated. If you can’t dry an item, placing it in the freezer can also kill bed bugs. Place items that are better suited for cold in your freezer.[16]",
                "Vacuum your luggage. Use an attachment on your vacuum cleaner or a handheld vacuum to clean your bag. Pay special attention to the crevices.[17]\n\nYou can also use a no-pest strip to treat your bag if you’re worried you may have encountered bed bugs. Place the strip and your luggage in a large garbage bag. Seal it and let it sit for two weeks.[18]",
                "Check secondhand furniture and clothes. Secondhand items are one of the biggest risks for bed bug infestation, so buying new items is always the safest bet. If you choose to buy secondhand furniture and clothing, make sure to carefully inspect the seams and crevices of all secondhand items for small reddish-brown bugs or red spots.[19]\n\nDon’t take pieces of furniture or mattresses from the dumpster or trash.\nImmediately wash and dry any washable items. Drying on high heat kills the bugs, so run items like pillows through the dryer.",
                "Minimize contact with surfaces at shared laundry facilities. Don’t let your clothes sit in the washer or the dryer. As soon as your clothes finish drying, take them out and place them in your own container. Don’t put them in the facility carts or on a folding table. Fold your clothes at home to avoid picking up any bugs that may have traveled with other patrons.[20]",
                "Inspect clothes you’re going to purchase. New clothing can become infected from other shoppers or contact with bed bug-infested parcels during shipping. Pay special attention to the seams of the clothing. Don’t just look for the bugs; remember to check for the tell-tale red spots.[21].\n\n\nWhen trying on items, put your own clothes on the hooks in the dressing room rather than the seating area because bugs are most likely to hide there.[22]"

        "How to Treat Hot Spots in Dogs": {
            "intro": "A hot spot, or what veterinarians term \"acute moist dermatitis,\" is a painful and inflamed area of the skin that is often accompanied by discharge and a bad odor. Hot spots occur via allergic reactions to bacterial skin infections often caused by a lesion or wound. Skin breaks, lesions, and wounds can have a variety of causes, including flea bites, scratches, scrapes or nicks, anal gland problems, and underlying allergies. Dogs often itch and scratch skin breaks and wounds to such an extent that wet scabs form on the fur.[1] Hot spots can be painful for dogs and can become very large quite quickly. It is important to seek prompt and adequate treatment if you notice a hot spot on your dog.[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Watch your dog. Notice if your dog scratches or licks a particular spot constantly. This is usually a sign that he is suffering from some sort of skin irritation.",
                "Part and inspect your dog's fur. Examine more closely the problem area you have identified. Hot spots can be difficult to see with the naked eye because they tend to spread under the cover of the dog's fur. Usually by the time you notice them, hot spots are well established and growing rapidly. [3]",
                "Identify that you are dealing with a hot spot. Hot spots are red, moist, hot and irritated rashes. Other identifiers of hot spots include discharge and an unpleasant odor.[4]\n\nHot spots are most commonly found on a dog's head, hip or chest area.\nDogs with long hair and thick coats are most commonly affected.\nDogs who are not groomed regularly and have matted coats are also prone to developing hot spots, as are dogs who swim or are frequently in the rain.[5]\n\nDogs with hip dysplasia or anal sac disease are also more likely to suffer from hot spots because they tend to lick the skin on their hind end.[6]",
                "Check areas surrounding the hot spot. If you do identify a hot spot, take some time to carefully check the rest of the dog’s skin. Part the fur in the area surrounding the hot spot and examine for any other moist or reddened areas. All spots need to be treated immediately and, if possible, you should try to ascertain the underlying cause of the hot spot (flea bite, scratch, allergy, etc.).[7]",
                "Contact your vet. If this is your dog's first hot spot, seeing a vet is crucial. Your vet can give you an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.[8]",
                "Trim or clip the hair from the surface of the hot spot. Exposing the hot spot to air will dry out the moisture and help speed up the healing process. Be careful not to pull the hair, irritate the skin or cut your dog's skin.[9]\n\nDisinfect your scissors or clippers before clipping. In cases where there is a lot of discharge emerging from the hot spot, you will need to clean your clippers frequently while removing hair. Otherwise, the clippers will become plugged with debris. Remember to clean and disinfect the instrument after use.[10]\n\nHave your dog sit or lie down for this process. Get a second person if you need help keeping the dog still.\nTo avoid accidentally cutting your dog's skin, don't cut too close to the skin itself and instead leave a quarter inch of stubble.[11]\n\nIf the affected area is too large, shave it.[12]",
                "Clean the wound. Use an antimicrobial shampoo that you can purchase at a vet's office or a pharmacy for humans.[13]\n\nA good product will contain chlorhexidine as an ingredient.[14]\n\nYou can also clean the area with a mild, water-based astringent or antiseptic spray.[15]\n\nConsult your veterinarian before use of any product on a hot spot.[16]",
                "Leave the antimicrobial shampoo on the dog for 10 minutes. This will allow the medication in the shampoo to settle into the affected area and begin working. Rinse thoroughly after 10 minutes and dry the affected area completely.[17]\n\nIf using an alternative solution, read and follow the accompanying instructions on how to apply.",
                "Apply an antibiotic ointment or spray. Your vet will usually prescribe a topical medication, such as a Gentamicin or Betamethasone spray. Your vet may also recommend oral antibiotics, depending on the situation.[18]\n\nYou can apply an antibiotic treatment on the wound up to three times per day.[19]",
                "Keep the area dry. The air will help the wound heal more effectively, whereas more moisture will facilitate the wound's growth.\n\n\nKeep in mind that hot spots can't be covered with a bandage because this traps moisture in and thereby worsens the wound.[20]",
                "Inspect the wound twice daily. If there is a buildup of discharge, repeat the shampoo process (shampoo, rinse, dry) to keep the wound clean.[21]",
                "Check the dog’s entire body for any new or developing hot spots. This check should be done daily, particularly if it is hot or humid out.",
                "Stop the itch with an antibiotic. The best way to relieve itching is with an antibiotic prescribed by your vet. Your vet may prescribe a cream antibiotic that is applied directly to the skin in order to quickly and directly relieve the itching.\n\n\nHydrocortisone spray can help reduce the irritation, but should not be used long term.\nAntihistamines such as Benadryl may also provide some relief. The appropriate dosage is 1 tablet per 50 pounds.\nAvoid putting creams intended for humans onto your dog's skin, as this can make matters worse. Creams keep moisture in the area, and the spot needs to dry completely before it can heal.",
                "Use an Elizabethan collar if your dog keeps licking or biting the lesions. The cone-shaped collar will restrain your dog's reach, making him unable to further irritate the wound.[22]\n\nAn Elizabethan collar should not be used as the sole means of treatment for hot spots. Collars don't treat the hot spots but prevent your dog from making the lesions more severe. Untreated lesions will only grow and become more serious, in addition to being painful for your dog.[23]\n\nYou can wrap a sock around one of the dog's rear feet and tape it into place if the hot spot can be scratched by a rear foot.",
                "Trim your dog's toe nails. This keeps your dog from having a ready way to scratch the area and spread the infected discharge.[24]"

        "wikiHow to Lighten Blonde Hair": {
            "intro": "Many girls want to lighten their naturally blonde hair to make it just a little brighter and bolder, especially during the summer months. Luckily, there are many methods of achieving blonder hair, whether you're on a budget, looking for a natural solution or trying to lighten your hair in a hurry. Just see Step 1 below to get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Use lemon juice. Lemon juice has be used as a natural bleaching agent in hair for a very long time. This is how it works: the citric acid in lemon juice opens up the hair cuticle and pulls out pigment, leaving hair stripped of color.\n\n\nMix half a cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice with half a cup of water and pour into a spray bottle. Spritz the lemon juice mixture into damp hair, then sit outside in the sun for 30 minutes, as the sunlight activates the citric acid.\nAfter 30 minutes (and no longer) rinse the stick lemon juice from your hair and use a deep conditioning treatment, as lemon juice can be very drying on your hair and scalp.[1]",
                "Use honey and olive oil. Honey is a natural lightening agent, while olive oil helps to nourish your hair, making this a less damaging lightening treatment than most.\n\n\nAdd 1/4 cup of honey to 1/4 cup of olive oil and stir until well combined. Use your hands to work the sticky mixture into damp hair, ensuring even coverage. Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap or some cling wrap.\nLeave the honey and olive oil mixture to sit in your hair for at least 30 minutes -- the longer you leave the mixture, the lighter your hair will be. When you're ready, rinse the mixture out in the shower -- it make take a couple of shampoos to get the sticky honey out of your hair.",
                "Use chamomile tea. Chamomile flowers contain natural compounds that help to lighten blonde hair, making chamomile tea an easy and effective treatment.\n\n\nBoil a pot of water, then place five chamomile teabags to steep in the pot. When the water has cooled completely, remove the teabags and pour the cold tea over your hair (preferably in the shower).\nAllow the chamomile tea to sit in your hair for about half an hour before rinsing. Like with the lemon juice, the chamomile will work more effectively if you sit in the sun for a while as it dries into your hair.",
                "Use cinnamon. To add some caramel blonde tones to your hair, you can use cinnamon in a nourishing and delicious-smelling treatment.\n\n\nTake a teaspoon of cinnamon (from a new jar to ensure it hasn't gone stale) and mix it with a generous handful of your regular conditioner. Work the conditioner through your hair, using a comb to ensure that it's evenly distributed.\nCover your hair with a plastic shower cap or some cling wrap and leave the cinnamon condition to sit in your hair for several hours, or overnight if possible. Wash the cinnamon out in the shower with shampoo.",
                "Use rhubarb. Rhubarb adds a yellowish tint to hair, which is good for people with darker blonde hair. It's best to use fresh, in-season rhubarb during the summer months.\n\n\nTake two stalks of rhubarb, wash them, then roughly chop them into small chunks. Add the rhubarb chunks to a pot of cold water, then bring the pot of water to the boil over a medium heat. Once boiled, remove the pot from the heat and allow the water to cool completely.\nOnce the water has cooled, strain the out the rhubarb piece, then pour the water over your hair. Leave the rhubarb water to sit in your hair for 10 to 15 minutes (while sitting in the sun, if you like) then rinse out with fresh water.",
                "Use baking soda. Baking soda can be used to strip chemical build-up from the hair while also helping to lighten blonde hair over time.\n\n\nTake the baking soda into the shower and sprinkle it over your hair once it's wet. Use your fingers to work the baking soda into the hair. It should form a paste-like consistency when mixed with water.\nUse this baking soda treatment to clean your hair (instead of using shampoo) at least once a week. Your hair will gradually lighten over time.",
                "Use vitamin C. Vitamin C is not only great for your health, it will also help to strengthen, nourish and lighten your locks.\n\n\nTake 5 to 10 tablets from a bottle of vitamin C supplements and crush them up using a pestle and mortar until they form a fine powder.\nAdd this vitamin C powder to your regular shampoo and wash your hair as normal. Do this once a week to gradually lighten your hair over time.[2]",
                "Use vinegar. Vinegar has been discovered as an effective hair lightener -- apple cider vinegar in particular.\n\n\nAlthough it's possible to apply vinegar to your hair straight from the bottle, this can be very drying and damaging for your hair. Therefore, it's better to dilute the vinegar to half strength with water first.\nPour the diluted vinegar over your hair and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes before rinsing out and shampooing. Repeat once a week for a gradual lightening effect.",
                "Use Sun-In. Sun-In is a classic hair-lightening product that became popular in the 90s. It is a very cheap and effect way to lighten blonde to medium brown hair, although the results tend to look more golden yellow than white blonde.\n\n\nSun-In can be purchased in most drug stores and online. It should be spritzed into damp hair, then worked through with a comb (this will prevent the color from developing unevenly).\nOnce the color is in, you should sit in the sun to activate the lightening agents. Alternatively, the heat from a hair dryer will also work. The more often you use Sun-In, the lighter your hair will be.[3]",
                "Use peroxide. Peroxide will effectively bleach your hair, leaving it a lighter shade of blonde. However, peroxide is also quite damaging for your hair, so it's best not to repeat this treatment too frequently.\n\n\nBottles of hydrogen peroxide can be purchased at the drugstore. Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with one part water and pour it into a clean spray bottle. Apply the peroxide solution evenly over your entire head of hair, but try to avoid your scalp as it is easily irritated by the peroxide.\nLeave the peroxide solution in your hair for 20 to 40 minutes -- the longer you leave it, the lighter your hair will become. Just don't leave the peroxide in for any longer than 40 minutes, as it can severely dry out your hair.\nShampoo your hair twice to remove all traces of the peroxide and apply a deep conditioning treatment to your hair.",
                "Use lemon vodka. Some sources recommend using lemon-flavored vodka to lighten blonde hair. The alcohol combined with lemon juice helps to strip pigment from the hair.\n\n\nPour the lemon vodka over your hair and use a comb to distribute it evenly. If you want more of a highlighted effect, dip a cotton ball in the alcohol and use it soak individual strands of hair, from the roots to the tips.\nSit in the sun for up to 30 minutes to intensify the bleaching effect of the alcohol, then rinse thoroughly and wash with shampoo.",
                "Use a lightening shampoo. If you're looking for a less damaging option that will still effectively lighten your blonde hair over time, you should use a lightening shampoo and conditioner combo -- such as John Frieda's \"Go Blonder\" range.[4]\n\nThese lightening shampoos and conditioners use a combination of lightening ingredients that includes chamomile and citrus. They can be substituted for your regular hair care products and used on a daily basis.\nThey work best on hair that is already a light to medium shade of blonde, though darker blondes will still notice a gradual lightening effect over time.",
                "Use blonde hair dye. Of course, if you want lighter blonde hair in a hurry and you're willing to spend a little more money, you can always use hair dye.\n\n\nMost store-bought kits will do a pretty good job of lightening hair (provided you follow the instructions), though the results can differ depending on your natural hair color.\nAll-over dyes are probably the simplest option, but if you are significantly changing the color of your hair the regrowth will be quite obvious, so you will have to reapply the dye every couple of months or so.\nAlternatively, you can buy an at-home highlighting kit, where you only apply the color to strands of hair on top of your head and around your face (where the sun would naturally hit). These are a little trickier to apply, but don't require quite as much maintenance.[5]\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable putting color in your hair at home, see a professional stylist instead -- just be prepared to pay a lot of money for blonder hair!",
                "Protect lightened hair from the sun. Once your hair has been lightened, it tends to be a little more sensitive to sunlight. Blonde hair in particular can become brassy, yellow or faded by the sun.\n\n\nTherefore, it's important that you protect your lightened hair by wearing a sunhat or by spritzing your hair with hairspray containing UV protection when outdoors.",
                "Be careful with salt water and chlorine. Salt water can fade and damage blonde hair, while chlorine dries it out and causes it to take on a green tinge.\n\n\nYou can prevent this from happening by rinsing your hair with fresh water before and directly after you go swimming.\nYou can also buy special protective hair masks which you apply to your hair before swimming to shield it from salt and chlorine.[5]",
                "Don't over-wash your hair.The detergents in most store-bought shampoos and conditioners can strip the blonde color from your hair over time.\n\n\nTherefore, you should avoid washing your hair every day -- most hair types don't even need it. Try to cut back to once every two or three days -- you can use a dry shampoo in between washings if necessary.\nWhen you do wash your hair, try to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner as these are kinder to hair.",
                "Deep condition your hair at least once a week. Lightened or dyed blonde hair is more susceptible to damage and color fading than other hair types.\n\n\nTherefore, it is important to keep your hair well-conditioned in order to keep the color looking as luminous as possible. You can do this by deep conditioning your hair once or twice per week.\nUse a store-bought deep conditioning product, a natural oil such as coconut or argan oil, or use a homemade hair mask using ingredients from your kitchen."

        "How to Get Rid of Warts": {
            "intro": "Warts. Even the name sounds unpleasant! Warts can be disfiguring and frustrating, as they are difficult to treat and do not have a definite cure. If you are burdened by the embarrassment of a common wart on your hand, face, foot, or other body part, this information will give you basic steps on how to help get rid of it.",
            "steps": [
                "Be patient. Warts are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus) and as such, can take quite a bit of time to eliminate naturally by one's immune system. Some warts will disappear over time, without treatment. However, \"time\" could mean anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple of years, so you may wish to choose a more active method. Whichever method you choose, allow it time to work. Some methods are faster acting than others. The fastest method to removing warts permanently is using 100% TCA. With this method results are often seen in less than 10 days and are permanent. It is also the cheapest and is discussed later.",
                "Use salicylic acid or 100% Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA).[1] Salicylic acid is the ingredient of most over-the-counter wart removers, including Compound W and Occlusal. It's effectiveness varies and it can take weeks for it work.\n\n\nSoak the skin in water for 5 minutes or longer, apply the acid liberally using the brush and let it dry. Leave it for a day. You can either peel or file it off and then file remaining dead skin. Do this every two or three days.",
                "Use duct tape. Several studies have tried to assess the effectiveness of duct tape in removing warts. Duct tape occlusion therapy (DTOT) is supposed to localize medication in the general wart area as well as \"choke\" the wart itself. One study found that duct tape following the application of imiquimod 5% cream was an effective treatment against the common wart. However it takes a long time (can take up to 6 months) and usually people don't see success with this.[2]",
                "Apply cantharidin. Ask your doctor about using cantharidin, a fast-acting chemical that will burn away the wart. Unfortunately, It can be really expensive, upwards of $500. [3] There is some pain involved, but you may see results in just a day.\n\n\nThe doctor applies cantharidin directly on the wart, then applies a bandage. The next day, the bandage is taken off and the dead skin is removed. If it doesn't work in one treatment, you may need another method—your doctor will make appropriate recommendations.",
                "Try liquid nitrogen. Another remedy your doctor may try is liquid nitrogen—or cryotherapy—to freeze the wart.[4] It may cause some discomfort, and can take a few treatments to completely remove a wart, but can be very effective. If it's not then the wart will usually come back bigger with bigger blood vessels and be almost impossible to remove. [5]\n\nAlternately, many drug stores carry OTC freeze treatments to zap the wart. If using an OTC wart freeze treatment, keep the following tips in mind:\n\nFollow the direction on the wart removal package. Your skin should turn from white to red in a matter of minutes, and a blister should begin to form underneath the wart.\nSmall black dots should appear beneath the wart after a few days. This is a sign that the treatment is working. Resist the urge to pull the wart off.\nThe wart should fall off on its own. If it doesn't, treat again after two weeks. Do not treat a wart that has been unsuccessfully treated three times; see a doctor.",
                "Burn the wart off. When other methods fail, burning the wart off may be what's needed. There will be some pain involved, and burning can lead to scarring, so the best recommendation it to let your doctor handle it. However, you can try this at home, if you're brave enough.\n\n\nSee your doctor. They can use a laser to burn the wart away. This is sometimes effective, but best recommended after other methods have failed.\nTry it at home. Light a match, blow it out, and while the match head is still hot, touch it to the wart. This causes blistering that initiates a healing response. Peel the layer of infected skin off, and cover with aloe and a strip bandage. Repeat as necessary. Try this at your own risk. Very dangerous.",
                "Have your doctor cut it out. When in doubt, have your doctor remove the wart by cutting it out surgically. This is something best left to a doctor, to prevent infection, and so that a local anesthetic can be used to mitigate the pain. A doctor will either do this by:\n\n\n\nElectrosurgery and curettage. This is where the doctor burns the wart with an electrical current and cuts it out afterward. The wart may still return because the blood vessels are still intact.[6][7]\n\n\nLaser surgery. This is where the doctor burns the wart with an intense beam of light.[7]",
                "Consider immunotherapy. Your doctor will be able to counsel you on this treatment, which uses your body's own defenses to attack the wart.",
                "Ask your doctor about Veregen. This is a new medication that is used to treat genital warts as well as other warts.",
                "Use imiquimod. This is a topical cream that is used to treat some types of warts and skin cancers by stimulating an immune response. It does not cure warts, but it may help, in concert with other treatments. Ask your doctor for guidance.",
                "Encourage antibodies. Ice the wart, then sterilize a needle and poke deep into the wart several times, taking care to penetrate every layer of skin in the wart. By introducing the virus to your bloodstream, you help your body see the wart and fight against it, which can lead to its disappearance from your body. This method is very effective for some people, especially for those with several warts, as even the poking of one wart on your body can help your body discover the others and destroy them.",
                "Cover it in vitamin C. Crush a vitamin C tablet and add water to make a thick paste. Apply it to the wart and then cover it with a bandage.Leave it on for the day then at night let it breathe (take off bandage)",
                "Wrap it in vitamin E. Break a vitamin E capsule and rub a little of the oil on the wart. Cover it with an adhesive bandage. Remove the bandage at night to let it breathe, then start over with the oil in the morning. Repeat three times a day.",
                "Use hot water and pumice. Soak the wart in hot water until it softens. Scrape it down with a piece of coarse exfoliating pumice until you reach level with the skin. Take bleach on a cotton swab and hold it against the wart for 15 minutes (this may sting a bit). You must wash the area well after applying bleach.",
                "Apply tea tree oil. Dab a little on the wart and cover with a strip bandage. Do this for up to three weeks.",
                "Try castor oil. The acid in castor oil irritates the wart and works best on small, flat warts on the face and back of hands. Apply castor oil to the wart with a cotton swab twice a day.",
                "Use aspirin. Take a few aspirins and crunch them up, adding a few drops of water. Take the mixture and put it onto the effected wart areas, then apply an adhesive bandage.. Leave on overnight. Aspirin is the ingestible form of salicylic acid, but much cheaper than most commercial lotions.",
                "Try some Betadine (iodine). Also called iodine, apply the Betadine to the wart and cover with a bandage and leave for one or two days then refresh bandage.",
                "Put toothpaste on the wart and apply an adhesive bandage. Leave for a day and repeat until the wart is gone.",
                "Use a citrus peel. Cut a section of lemon or lime peel slightly larger than the wart and tape it over with an adhesive bandage or tape. Refresh the peel every day or so and keep the wart covered for as long as possible. After about a week or so, the entire wart will come out completely.",
                "Use basil. Tape crushed, fresh basil to your wart using waterproof first-aid tape. Do this daily for up to a week. The virus-killing compound in the basil leaf will kill your wart.",
                "Take garlic capsules. Do this twice a day for at least several weeks. Warts should start peeling off in one or two weeks, but take the garlic until the wart disappears. You can also cover the wart with garlic oil once or twice daily for a month.[8]",
                "Eat immune system-strengthening foods. Garlic, sweet potatoes, whole-grain breads, sunflower seeds and rice are all examples of this.",
                "Cut up carrots. Finely grate a carrot and add enough olive oil to it to make a paste. Dab the paste on your wart twice daily for 30 minutes. Do this for two to three weeks.",
                "Make a fig mask. Mash up a fresh fig and place some on your wart for 30 minutes. Do this daily for two to three weeks.",
                "Use lemon juice. Squeeze lemon juice on your wart, then cover it with fresh, chopped onions. Do this for 30 minutes once a day for two to three weeks.",
                "Put it in pineapple juice. Soak your wart in pineapple juice. It has a dissolving enzyme.",
                "Rub daily with the inside of a banana peel. The potassium may help speed the disappearance of the wart.",
                "Bind your wart with a banana peel. Cut out a section of the peel so it's slightly smaller than the tape you'll be using. Rub the inside of a banana peel onto the wart and then secure with duct tape. Keep it on the wart for a day before removing. Repeat until wart is fully removed.",
                "Create a preparation of curcumin. Curcumin is a turmeric extract that can be found in health food stores. Combine curcumin, papaya extract (Papain. It may have to be purchased in pill form and crushed into powder), and vitamin E oil.\n\n\nDab the wart and surrounding area with alcoholic extract of golden seal. This will stimulate local immune activity.\nTake a sharp needle or pin and dip it into the curcumin paste. Press the needle as deep into the wart as possible. Continue injecting more of the paste into the wart, poking several holes if necessary.\nSpread the remaining paste over the wart area and cover with medical tape. This technique is effective against flat warts, which are found on the face and hands. Flat warts are notoriously stubborn and will often remain on the skin after the body has acquired resistance to the virus. This will finish the warts off in lieu of freezing.",
                "Use apple cider vinegar. Take a cotton ball (only enough to cover the wart) and soak it in the vinegar. Secure with a band aid overnight. Keep in mind that this might be very painful. Change the cotton pad daily and keep it on every night if you can. After one week, the body of the wart will start to peel off and you can gently scrape it away to reveal healthy flesh beneath. Let the area heal once this is done.",
                "Use warm water and sea salt. Soak the wart for 10 to 15 minutes in warm salt water to moisten the skin. Scrape the dead skin layers off the wart using a nail file, pumice stone or mild sandpaper. You could also use your fingers, but wash them thoroughly before and after, as warts can easily spread. Moisten the wart and apply a large flake of sea salt to it.\n\n\nPut a band-aid or tape over the wart to hold the salt in place and observe for several days, replacing it after you shower or if it falls off.",
                "Mix up baking powder. Mix baking powder and castor oil into a paste, then apply it to the wart at night by covering it with a bandage. Remove the bandage the next morning. Repeat as necessary.",
                "Use hot water. Soaking plantar warts in very hot water is helpful because it softens the wart and may kill the virus. Make sure the water is not hot enough to cause burns—keep it under 140°F (60°C).",
                "Apply dandelion sap. Pick a fresh dandelion and Break the stem. Apply the milky sap that oozes from the stem onto the wart. Repeat this three or four times a day. Scrape the wart with pumice to remove dead layers of skin. Continue doing this until the wart fades away.",
                "Avoid touching warts as much as possible. Warts are small growths on the body, and are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and can spread to other parts of your body.\n\n\nIt's also possible to spread the HPV virus to others through cuts, open sores, or sexual activities.",

        "How to Tell Your Mom About Your Period": {
            "intro": "Getting your period for the first time can be scary, and the prospect of having to tell your mom can be even worse! But remember that menstruation is a completely normal and natural part of many people’s lives: your mom went through the exact same thing, and so did her mother before her. Even if you are nervous about telling your mom, there’s no reason to be afraid or ashamed. You’ll most likely look back afterward and wonder what all the fuss was about!",
            "steps": [
                "Learn what having your period means. The menstrual cycle is a monthly process your body undergoes in preparation for pregnancy. In the beginning of the cycle, your body creates more estrogen, which causes the lining of the uterus to thicken with blood and mucous. At the same time, the ovaries release an egg. An egg that gets fertilized by male sperm would attach itself to the thickened uterine wall. But, if the egg is not fertilized, it breaks apart and is expelled by your body. At this time, the excess uterine lining is also shed, and this is what comes out as your monthly period.[1]\n\nGirls usually get their periods between the ages of 12 and 14, but it can happen as early as 8 or 9 years old.\nLots of people talk about monthly periods, but it’s pretty normal to be slightly irregular, especially at first. Don’t be worried if you don’t get your period on the exact same day every month. Generally, people get a period every 21 to 35 days, and they usually last anywhere from three to five days.[2]",
                "Find supplies. Every girl has a different preference when it comes to feminine hygiene products. The best way to figure out your favorite is to try them all! You can buy menstrual products at drug stores, grocery stores, and online, but if you know where your mom or sister keeps hers, you can always borrow those until you’ve had the talk with your mom (most people keep them under the sink in the bathroom, in closets or cupboards near the sink or toilet, or maybe in a linen closet near the bathroom). There are actually quite a few of feminine hygiene products on the market, and while some are disposable, other are reusable.\n\n\nPads and liners are disposable, and protect your undergarments by absorbing menstrual fluid after it’s expelled from your body.\nCloth pads work similarly to pads and liners, but are washable and reusable.\nTampons are disposable, and are inserted into the vagina and absorb fluid before it’s expelled.\nMenstrual cups are silicone cups that are inserted like tampons, but they get cleaned and reused throughout your period. Because tampons and cups catch menstrual fluid before it comes out, these are ideal for swimming and sports.[3]",
                "Control cramps and PMS. Premenstrual syndrome is a term used to describe a variety of symptoms that some people experience in the days or weeks leading up to their period. Although the exact cause isn’t fully understood, PMS seems to be caused by hormonal and chemical changes that occur during the menstrual cycle, and they are possibly affected by diet and vitamin levels as well. Everybody’s different, but symptoms can include depression or heightened emotional reactions, cravings, fatigue, bloating, aches and pains, headaches, and tender breasts.[4] Abdominal cramps are also common during menstruation, and they are caused by contractions of the uterus.\n\n\nAnti-inflammatories and pain medicine like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen can help control cramping and aches.\nAvoid smoking,(which is illegal under the age of 18) drinking alcohol, (which is illegal under the age of 21) consuming caffeine, and excessive salt consumption (this will help prevent water retention and bloating).\nRegular exercise will help reduce menstrual cramping and improve your mood.\nEat a healthy, well-balanced diet all the time.[5]\n\nKeep healthy snacks on hand to combat over-indulging your cravings. If you have trouble controlling cravings, opt for healthier snack options. For salt cravings, try homemade rice and soy sauce instead of high-sodium junk food. Make yourself some hot cocoa from scratch instead of binging on chocolate bars. Make your own French fries in the oven if you are craving deep-fried food.",
                "Prepare yourself for the talk with your mom. It’s important that you stay calm and not panic when you get your period! It’s totally normal and not a big deal, and neither is telling your mom. Give yourself time to process the changes happening to your body. Don’t worry if you aren’t ready to tell your mom right away: it’s your body and your choice.\n\n\nBefore you tell your mom, make sure you are relaxed. Do whatever works for you, whether it’s a bath, walk, book, nap, deep breathing, or something else.\nThink about what you want to say to your mom. Try writing down a few points or questions, or rehearse what you’re going to say.\nYou can ask a school nurse, doctor, teacher, or other trusted adult for help if you have questions and still aren’t ready to tell your mom. Sometimes it can be easier to tell someone else first, and then telling your mom won’t seem so hard.\nYou can try talking to a friend or sibling first if it's easier. If female chances are they've went through or are currently going through and can give some tips.",
                "Ask to talk to your mom in private. Find some quiet time when you and your mom can have a chat alone. Don’t freak yourself out! Try not to think about it too much, and instead just dive right in. Remember, she’s your mom; there’s nobody in the world who loves you more, and she understands what you’re going through. Approach the topic any way you like, whether you’ve got a whole song and dance planned, or if you want to start off by saying you feel a little uncomfortable but need to talk to her. If you are having trouble figuring out what to say, try something like:\n\n\n“ I think I started my period.”\n“Can we go to the store? I need some things.”\n“This is difficult for me to say, but I’ve started my period.”\n“I don’t know how to say this, but ‘‘it’’ came…”\n\" I just wanted to tell you I've started my period...\"",
                "Casually bring it up when you’re together. Anytime you are alone together is a great time to approach the subject with your mom, especially if the idea of a formal sit-down with her seems too nerve wracking. You can do it on the way to school, soccer practice, or piano lessons, while watching TV, out for a walk, before she says goodnight, or any other time you have together that isn’t rushed. Casually let your mom know that you got your period.\n\n\nSegue into the subject by asking her how old she was when she got her period if you don’t feel comfortable coming out and saying it.\nWork it into a conversation about something completely non-related if you need to. That will give you time to get talking and relax, and then you can slip it in when you feel comfortable.",
                "Make an intentional stop in the feminine hygiene aisle with her. Out shopping together can be a great opportunity to tell your mom about your period without really having to bring it up. Steer her toward the feminine hygiene products in the grocery or drug store, and tell her that you need to pick up some supplies. This is a great time to ask her about recommendations, and she’ll pick up on the fact that you’re trying to tell her about your period.",
                "Ask questions. Getting your period means your body is going through a number of changes. Ask your mom any questions you have. This is a great time for you to bond, and she’ll probably have loads of stuff she wants to talk about.\n\n\nUse this time to ask her about sexual health as well if you are comfortable bringing it up.\nAsk if she has any favorite products, what she craves when she’s on her period, and how she manages any PMS symptoms or cramps.",
                "Write your mom a note. Telling your mom in person can be scary, and if you don’t feel confident doing that, you can always tell her with a note. That way, she can initiate the conversation with you next time you’re alone together.[6] Leave the note somewhere private that she’ll definitely find it, like in her purse. Notes can be long and complicated, or short and sweet, like:\n\n\n“Hey Mom, I got my period today! Maybe we can get supplies at the drug store later? I love you.”\n“I got my period. Could you please bring home some pads/tampons? Thanks!”",
                "Tell her over the phone. You can still kind of tell your mom in person by doing it over the phone if you really don’t feel comfortable telling her face to face. Use the same techniques and tactics that you would if you were telling her in person, or you can say something like:\n\n\n“I’ll be home in an hour, and maybe we can talk for a few minutes, because I got my period.”\n“I’ll be home later than normal because I’m stopping at the drug store for some tampons.”\n“Can we have chocolate cake for dessert? I’ve really been craving it since I got my period!”",
                "Send her a text. Another way to let your mom know what’s going on with you is by sending a text. It’s not the most personal way, but it’ll get the job done! You can use similar phrasing as if you were writing her a more personal letter, such as saying:\n\n\n“Just wanted to let you know I got my period. See you at home later!”\n“Can we talk later? I've started my period.”\n“Are you going shopping soon? I got my period and need some supplies.”"

        "wikiHow to Shoot Dice": {
            "intro": "Dice games are criminally under-appreciated. Shooting dice, also known as street craps, is a slightly simplified version of traditional Casino Craps, and is a classic hustle. You can also learn to play Mexican drinking dice, Farkle, and other games that only require you to know a few rules and get a few dice in a cup. Next time you're looking for something to do, dump the board game and keep the dice. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn the basics. Regular street craps is played with two dice, which are used by a single player in each game, though the game can be played by any number of onlookers.\n\n\nPlayers will first roll the dice to determine who will roll for that particular game, and then all the participants will place bets on whether or not the person rolling will \"pass\" on the first roll (by rolling a 7 or 11), or \"crap out\" (by rolling a 2, 3, or a 12). If one of those values is reached on the first roll, the game is over and the bets are distributed accordingly.\nThe player shooting the dice is the first to bet and the other players must at least match his bet before the game can continue. If the bet cannot be matched, the shooter can either lower the bet to accommodate the other players, or handicap the odds. Once the shooter's bet has been matched, the other players may place side bets.[1]",
                "Learn the rules of the point. If the shooter neither passes nor craps out on the first roll, then the number rolled becomes the \"point.\" Now, the only two values that matter on the roll are that point value and 7.\n\nThe player must continue rolling until either the point or 7 is reached. All bets that the shooter would \"pass\" are now bets that the shooter will re-roll the value of the point before rolling a 7, and all bets to the contrary are bets that 7 will be rolled first.\nIf the game goes to point, as soon as the shooter rolls the point or 7, the game is over and the bets are awarded accordingly.",
                "Learn the lingo. You'll make the learning curve a lot shorter if you don't have to ask for clarification every time someone says something about the \"come-out\" or the point. Learn the basic vocab and you'll be rolling soon enough:\n\n\n\nThe shooter is the player who rolls the dice, and will be a different player for each game\n\nThe come out is the initial roll\nTo pass is to roll a 7 or 11 on the come out roll\nTo crap is to roll a 2, 3, or 12 on the come out roll\n\nThe point is any value between 4 and 10 rolled on the come out\nTo seven out is to roll a seven before rolling the point",
                "Learn the difference between street craps and casino craps. In casino craps, obviously, the biggest difference is that you've got an elaborate table on which to place bets, as well as a banker controlling both the money and the action, and James Bond lookalikes are wandering around ordering elaborate drinks. In street craps, the betting is less formalized, and you're probably rolling dice against a brick wall, though the principles of the game are basically the same.\n\n\nBecause no one is watching the action, make sure that the piles stay even throughout the game and the tokens or money are distributed fairly. Tempers can flare if you don't take the game seriously and keep it clean.",
                "Understand the legal issues. Unregulated gambling like street craps is illegal in every state in the US and in many places elsewhere. There's nothing wrong with playing for fun, and it's unlikely anyone would hassle you over a low-stakes penny game among friends, but it's still important to know that gambling for money outside of a licensed and regulated casino is always illegal.",
                "Start the game by anteing up. Like in most card games, if you want to play you've got to ante up by throwing a pre-determined value (usually small) in the pot. This will happen before you decide on the shooter and before you place any bets.\n\nWhat you're paying for is basically the right to be considered for shooting. You don't have to place a bet after you've anted up. Like in cards, if you want to sit out for a game but still watch and think about betting, you need to ante up first.",
                "Roll to see who the shooter is. All players who anted will roll to determine the shooter. Whoever rolls the highest number shoots. Different games may have different rules--you could also roll until someone reaches 7, or whatever pre-determined way of choosing you desire. The point is, you must pick a shooter randomly.",
                "Place your initial pass or no-pass bets. Once the shooter is selected, the shooter will bet first. The amount of the bet will be either \"pass\" or \"crap,\" though in some games it's assumed that the shooter will always bet on himself (or will always bet pass, in other words).\n\nThe other players must cumulatively come up with enough to at least match the shooter's bet before placing side bets or increasing the wager. To match the shooter's bet is to come up with the same amount of \"money,\" in support of the opposite outcome. If you've anted up, you can throw in to match, or you can wait and bet on the side.\nSay the shooter makes a $10 pass bet. The other players must cumulatively come up with $10, but betting crap. So, if you throw in $2 on the initial bet toward the crap, the most you stand to win back is your $2 and $2 of the shooter's money.\nIf the other players match the shooter's bet, you can place a side bet with other players who are willing to match more bets if you still want to play. This might include betting either pass or crap.",
                "Roll the come-out. The shooter rolls the initial come out roll. If the shooter passes or craps, the game is over and the money is distributed evenly among the players, according to the bets placed. If the shooter rolls a point, all pass bets become point bets and all crap bets become bets that the shooter will 7 out.",
                "Roll for point if necessary. Continue rolling until the shooter points up or goes 7 out. Depending on the game, if a point is reached, sometimes the betting goes into higher gear. A round of side betting when the game goes to point is not uncommon, just as in poker the betting may continue. Although folding is not a possibility in craps, so it's probably more often that the initial bets stand through until the end, because the games are relatively short.",
                "Get statistical. Because you're using two dice, the probability of rolling any particular number is different depending on the number. Some values are more likely than other values, because there's more than one way to reach them. By learning a little bit about the statistical probability of rolling a particular number each time, you can make smarter bets.\n\n7 is the most likely roll on any particular shot. There is a 17% chance of rolling a 7 each time, because there are a total of 6 ways to get that value between the two dice, out of 36 possible value combinations between the two.\nThe probability of rolling the other values makes a pyramid. 6 and 8 are the next most likely rolls, with five different ways to get each value, making them 14% likely. 5 and 9 are the next most likely values, and so on. 2 and 12 are the least likely rolls because there is only one way to roll them, snake eyes and a double six, respectively.",
                "Use statistics to know the best bets. Pass bets are always more likely. Betting on 7 is generally a smart bet, because the odds of rolling a 2, 3, or 12 are fairly unlikely when compared to the odds of rolling a 7 or 11. When you know about the likelihood of reaching any particular value on a given roll, you can place smarter bets.\n\nSay you're in a game and you've betted crap, and the shooter rolls a 4. Now the likelihood is reversed, and the shooter's in the corner. It's more likely on the next roll he'll roll a 7, so your initial bet paid off. Now your odds are better.",
                "When you're the shooter, roll the dice correctly. Set the dice so that on the top of each die the 3 is facing up in a V shape. This is traditionally the \"set\" for the dice, so all players know you're not cheating or doing something unfair to the game.\n\n\nUsually, there's a designated surface the dice have to hit. In casino craps, the dice must go all the way to the back wall of the table for it to count. This is why most street craps games are played against walls. Generally, you'll be a few feet away and roll against the wall, or some other kind of backdrop.",
                "Bet big when you're the shooter. Most times when you shoot crap, the game involves the shooter making the biggest bet that he will pass and all the other players betting smaller amounts that he will crap out. Because, as you've seen from the probability, it's most likely that the first roll will be a 7. So, don't jump into the game making huge foolish bets on crap outs that are unlikely. Wait until you're the shooter if you want to win.",
                "Learn other dice games. Dice are super simple, but have a whole load of possibilities for games, some of which have unfortunately fallen out of style. You don't need an elaborate game board or an Xbox to play fun games, and there are plenty of games that don't require complex series of bets to enjoy. Learn a few and mix it up.\n\n\nIt's also important to distinguish between playing street craps and playing other kinds of dice games, some of which involve betting and some of which don't. If someone asks if you want to \"shoot dice,\" they could be referring to some other game, though craps is the most likely.",
                "Try cee-lo. Sometimes called lo dice, in this popular game, each player has three dice, usually in some kind of cup, and each player rolls simultaneously after a round of betting. The object is to get the highest possible score, though the scoring works somewhat like poker.\n\nThe highest possible combination is to roll a 4, 5, and a 6. This is like a royal flush in poker.\nThe next highest combination would be triples. Even if you rolled all ones, rolling three ones would be the next highest category of score, only beaten by triples of any other number, or the 4, 5, 6 combo.[2]\n\nThe next highest combination is called a \"pair and a spare,\" which is sort of like a full house. This would be a matched pair, plus some other value. In the event two players rolled double 4's, the higher value of the other die would be the winner. If a player rolled two twos with an extra six, while another player rolled two sixes with an extra two, the first player would win. Ties are awarded to the highest value on the extra die, the pair doesn't matter.\nIf two players roll exactly the same thing, generally a re-roll is performed.",
                "Play drinking dice. Also sometimes called Mexican dice or liar's dice, this is a game of deception that can get fun and rowdy, especially when somewhat, uh, lubricated. In drinking dice, players pass around a single cup with two dice in it and take turns guessing at the value under them, either challenging or accepting the value as reported by the previous player.\n\nThe first player rolls the dice and carefully looks at the value so the other players can't see, then says aloud the value, either choosing to bluff by reporting the wrong value, or telling the truth. The player then passes the cup carefully so as not to tip over the dice to the player to his right.\nThe next player can either challenge or accept the value as reported by the previous player, or can up the ante by making a guess of their own. Eventually, the game must continue until someone challenges. If, upon challenging, the initial report was correct, the challenger and all other players lose, unless a subsequent player had reported or guessed correctly. If a challenge is upheld, the liars are the losers, and usually have to take a drink.\nThe point values vary from game to game, though generally a 1-2 combo is considered the highest possible value. It's also possible to play the game \"blind,\" meaning that no one ever looks at the value until someone challenges.",
                "Roll bones. While \"rolling bones\" is sometimes slang for shooting craps, bones is actually a distinct and complex game that's similar to Yahtzee, and is also sometimes called hot dice or \"Farkle,\" though each game has a somewhat distinct scoring system in place. It's played with five or six dice and a cup passed between the players. The goal is to accumulate the most points in the round, or to accumulate the most points over a given number of rounds.[3]\n\nThe first player rolls all six dice, keeping some by setting them aside, and returning the rest to the cup. Keepable dice include any that show 1, which are worth 100 points, and any that show 5, which are worth 50 points. If you roll 3 of a kind (say, three 2s) you'll also keep those, worth that many hundred points. In other words, three 2s would be worth 200 points, while three 6s would be worth 600. Return all dice that can't be counted back into the cup and roll again.\nThe player continues rolling until he's either \"kept\" all the dice, or has rolled something that can't be counted (like a 2, 4 and 4). On subsequent rolls, you can improve previous 3 of a kinds that you've kept. Say you rolled three 3s on your first roll and returned the other three dice back to the cup. If you rolled a 3 on your subsequent roll, the value of your 3 of a kind would be doubled."

        "How to Create a Benefit Concert Series": {
            "intro": "Hosting a benefit concert series for your cause is one of the easiest and most rewarding methods of raising money. Not only will you build local awareness and gain support for your organization, but you'll also get to enjoy some great music in the process. With careful planning and effective marketing, you'll soon be on your way to hosting successful events.",
            "steps": [
                "Find a cause that you are passionate about. You won't be able to put in the required work or inspire others to help you if you don't fully believe in what you are doing.",
                "Build a team of like-minded people. Realize that you can't do this on your own. It's not necessary to build a large team, but you'll need at least a few more people who share your enthusiasm for the cause.\n\n\nIf you can, try to recruit friends or acquaintances with useful skills or connections. For example, if you know someone with ties to the local music scene, be sure to have them tap in to that. Other useful attributes might include advertising skill and ties to local companies and organizations.",
                "Choose dates and times. Check the local papers to make sure that your events aren't on dates where a lot of other events are scheduled. Be sure to give your team plenty of time to organize. You should begin working on the details of your event at least two months in advance.[1]",
                "Set a price. Find out what other organizations charge for similar events in your area. Survey your colleagues and find out how much they'd want to pay.",
                "Locate sponsors. Find businesses, organizations, or charities to help with funding and supplying your events. Support from sponsors can include everything from simply donating to your cause to providing food or refreshments at the event. This is a win-win; the sponsor will gain publicity and you'll gain their endorsement and whatever support they provide.[2]",
                "Create a tentative budget. Keep in mind that you'll have to spend money to raise money. This is mainly important for knowing how much you'll be able to spend on performers or on their stage setups if they are willing to perform free of charge. Conservatively estimate your ticket sales and sponsor donations and go from there.[3]",
                "Find artists or bands to perform. This is the most important part of any concert, but also the most difficult to organize. You don't need to (and likely won't be able to) book anyone famous. Local musicians are always looking to market themselves and will be able to pull in more attendees to your concert.[4]\n\nFinding bands can be hard but is not impossible with the right connections. Does a sponsor or a member of your cause have connections with a band? Do you have friends in the music industry or do you know someone who runs a music venue? Use your contacts to their fullest extent.\nIf you can't find bands through your contacts, it's time to research and cold call. Research can be done through the local papers and the Internet. Make calls to the managers of the performing acts you want. See if you can reach a deal. Many artists will perform at a lower rate or for free for charity.\nConsider booking several different types of acts for your concerts to attract a variety of supporters. Guests that don't often listen to rock music may skip that concert but join you if you book an R&B artist for the next show. Variety may also help you appeal to different sponsors.",
                "Book your venues. Make sure your venues are easily accessible and have enough room for your expected number of concert-goers. Price will obviously be an issue here. Consider using a local park or seeking out venues that offer lower rates for charitable events. Be sure to also rent lighting equipment and everything else the bands need if they are not willing to provide it.",
                "Create an online presence for your events. Make separate Facebook events and make sure you and your fellow organizers invite all of your local friends. Be sure that sponsors and partner organizations advertise your events on their accounts and various forms of social media.[5]",
                "Craft a strong pitch for your cause. This is what you will use to convince sponsors, advertisers, and guests that your concert is worth supporting. Anything you can get donated or a reduced rate just means more money raised for your charity.[6]",
                "Send out press releases. These should go to the local newspapers, websites, radio stations and television stations (including the local cable access channel) for the community calendar.[7]",
                "Make flyers for your events and post them in popular places in town like the supermarket, phone booths, kiosks, local bars and coffee shop. Also consider places relevant to the music scene such as record shops, other concert venues, and music schools.\n\n\nConsider contacting a local art school to ask a graphic designer to design your flyer. Young artists are likely to do this work for free for the exposure and experience. Be sure to noticeably credit the artist on the flyer.",
                "Find a company to provide merchandise or concessions at your events. You'd be surprised how much the promise of good food can draw in attendees. If you can, find a printing company to provide you with custom T-shirts for your event. Even if they are not donated, you can still make a quick profit on T-shirt sales.",
                "Network the concert series in person. Be sure to spread the word for your events everywhere you go. Hand out your flyers in the street with enthusiasm and hype up the event the week before each one.",
                "Sell advance tickets. Offer printable tickets online as well as pre-printed ones. One method is to sell large amounts of advance tickets to sponsors who can them give them out to members or customers. This provides both up-front money and free advertising for your events.",
                "Find volunteers to take tickets and lead people to their seats. Consider using high school students for this, since they often need community service hours in order to graduate.",
                "Devise a money-management method. You want to know exactly how much money is coming in the door and through your vendors to your cause. You can use this later to announce your success or persuade to crowd to donate more to help you reach a goal.\n\n\nWith the decline of cash payments, many people will no longer be carrying cash around with them. Consider using a mobile payment processor to allow guests to buy tickets and donate. There are several options to choose from to be sure to do your research.[8]",
                "Arrive at your venue early on the day of each event. Make sure the venue, vendors, and your volunteers are ready. Reinforce why you are all there and the difference you are making.",

            "intro": "Belize is a small English-speaking nation located in Central America along the Caribbean Sea between Mexico and Guatemala. It is home to natural beauty and a tranquil environment that is sought after by many retirees and travelers. While Belize is a beautiful tourist destination, many people decide to stay in Belize long-term as permanent residents or become citizens. While some red tape and patience is required, getting citizenship in this country is not incredibly difficult.",
            "steps": [
                "Research available options. There a few different ways to become a citizen or resident of Belize, and they each have different sets of application procedures and eligibility requirements.\n\n\nPermanent Residency\nQualified Retired Persons Program\nCitizenship",
                "Apply for citizenship by descent. If you have family members who are Belizean citizens, you may qualify to apply for citizenship by descent before you move to Belize.\n\n\nCitizenship is granted to individuals born in Belize and to the children and grandchildren of citizens of Belize.\nYour Belizean parent or grandparent does not need to be alive at the time of your application for you to receive citizenship, but you will need to be able to prove that they were legal Belizean citizens.",
                "Marry a Belizean. If you marry a citizen of Belize, you are eligible to become a Belizean citizen as well. [1]\n\nBelizean citizens can file for citizenship for their foreign born spouses as soon as their marriage is legalized.[2]\n\nMarriages are investigated to make sure they are not fraudulent immigration scams.\nAll children from this marriage are automatically eligible to become Belizean citizens, whether they are born in Belize or in another nation.",
                "Apply to become a naturalized Belizean. If you do not qualify for citizenship through marriage or descent, you will need to go through the citizenship application process. This is a long-term process that has a specific set of requirements that must be met.\n\n\nBelize requires the applicant to have lived in Belize as a permanent resident for a minimum of 5 years before they can apply for citizenship.\nThe citizenship application is usually processed within 6 months, but may take up to a year, or more.[3]",
                "Enter Belize on a tourist visa. When you decide to move to Belize, you will first need to obtain a tourist visa to remain in the country for over 30 days. If you have received citizenship status through marriage or descent, this is not applicable to your situation.\n\n\nAll visitors, besides cruise ship passengers, must present a valid passport before entering the country. Your passport must not expire within three months of your arrival date.\nYou can stay in Belize for up to one month without a visa.\nIf you decide to stay longer than a month, you must go to the Immigration Department in Belize City or Belmopan to receive a visa extension and to pay for a new tourist visa. [4]\n\nAll prospective Belizean residents must enter the country on a tourist visa until they have completed one year of residency.",
                "Renew your tourist visa. Tourist visas are intended for short stays, and can be extended up to one year. They do carry certain requirements and can be renewed.\n\n\nCheck to see if your current country of residence requires a specific Belize visa to enter Belize. [5][6]\n\nThere is a flat rate fee for a tourist visa that increases after the sixth month of your stay. [7]\n\nIf you are driving or boating into Belize from either Guatemala or Mexico, you will receive a temporary importation permit for your transportation. [8]\n\nYou cannot legally work in Belize with a tourist visa so ensure that you come to the country with enough funds to sustain yourself.",
                "Apply for permanent residency. Permanent residency is the first step in becoming a citizen in Belize if you are not the relative or spouse of a Belizean citizen. Applicants for permanent residency must live in Belize for one year prior to applying.\n\n\nTo become a permanent resident, you must first enter the country on a tourist visa. You will then apply for residency and renew your tourist visa every 30 to 90 days until your residency is denied or granted.\nDuring this one-year period, you may not leave the country for more than 14 consecutive days.\nTo apply for permanent residency you will need to complete Permanent Residency Application form, take an HIV and STI test, provide proof of a clean criminal record from the police, and two recommendations from individuals who have known you for at least one year. [9]\n\nThere are fees associated with applying for permanent residency. The fees range from $250 to $5000 USD and vary based upon your home nationality. [10]\n\nOnce you receive residency, you will pay $62.50 USD for a residency card.",
                "Apply for the Qualified Retired Persons Program. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you may also apply to be a Belizean resident through the QRP program. This is a shorter process and is an attractive option for older individuals and retirees. [11]\n\nTo qualify you must be at least 45 years old and be able to show that you have adequate financial resources to live in Belize, because you cannot legally work in Belize as a QRP.\nYou must provide financial documents that demonstrate that you have the resources to deposit at least $2,000 USD each month.\nTo maintain your QRP status, you must spend at least one month out of the year in Belize. You can live in any other nation you desire in the remaining 11 months if you wish.\nQRPs are considered non-residents for banking purposes so they can set up a bank account with a local or offshore bank in Belize.\nQRP status is not the same as citizenship, it is a separate program that is akin to residency. [12]",
                "Apply for citizenship. To receive nationality status (i.e. citizenship), you must become a permanent resident, and have been a legal resident of Belize for a minimum of five years. If you become a citizen through descent or marriage, these requirements will not apply to your case.\n\n\nAfter five years of residence, you can now apply for citizenship.\nThere is a provision available to register an applicant’s minor children at the same time an individual applies for nationality. [13]\n\nIf you achieve nationality, any of your children under age 18 are entitled to become a Belize citizen, regardless of where they were born. [14]\n\nYou must apply to be a citizen in Belize, you cannot apply remotely.",
                "Collect the necessary documents. While you are compiling your citizenship application, you must prepare certain documents, pay certain fees, and understand application procedures.\n\n\nYou must be prepared to swear an oath of allegiance, have a basic understanding of the Belizean Constitution, and recognize Belize's sovereignty.\nApplications for citizenship must be made in person while in Belize. [15]\n\nYou will need your birth certificate, identification forms like a Social Security card, to fill out an application form, provide financial statements, a police record proving you have no prior criminal convictions, a medical test proving you do not have HIV or any STIs and to pass background checks.[16]\n\nThere are fees associated with the citizenship application, just as there are fees associated with permanent residency and tourist visa applications.",
                "Renounce or maintain other citizenships. While there are a few ways to become a citizen of Belize, there are some restrictions to keep in mind.\n\n\nYour home nation may require you to denounce your citizenship or have limitations in place for citizens with dual nationalities. Be sure to know the laws of your home country about holding dual citizenships. [17]\n\nBelize allows its citizens to hold dual nationality status with other nations. This means that if you are a Belize citizen you can also be a citizen of another country, if that country also allows you to hold dual nationality status.\nHowever, if you are a Guatemalan national you must renounce your Guatemalan citizenship to become a Belizean citizen.",
                "Enjoy the benefits of citizenship. There are quite a few benefits to becoming a citizen, rather than remaining a permanent resident.\n\n\nYou can vote in Belizean elections as a citizen.\nYou are eligible to hold a Belizean passport.[18]\n\nYou can join the Belizean armed forces.\nYou become a member of CARICOM. The Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, allows you to travel freely between member nations in Latin American and the Caribbean. [19][20]\n\nYou can work and own a business in Belize without a work permit."

        "wikiHow to Debloat Using Yoga": {
            "intro": "Whether you're simply bloated and gassy after a large meal or have a chronic condition that causes it, bloating can be uncomfortable or even embarrassing. While medications can help ease the symptoms, it also is possible to debloat using yoga. Yoga breathing and poses can help relax your nervous system, alleviate gas, and stimulate your abdominal organs to help improve your digestion and make bloating less uncomfortable and less likely to happen in the future.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Calm your nerves with a seated forward bend. The seated forward bend is a relatively simple stretch that provides whole-body relaxation. If your digestive troubles are related to stress or tension, this pose may help you debloat with yoga.[2]\n\nStart from a seated position on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. You may want to place a blanket or towel under your hips to help keep you in alignment or to cushion your sitting bones.\nOn an exhale, raise your arms over your head and slowly hinge forward from your hips, keeping your back straight and flat. Lower yourself as far as you comfortably can to your legs. Ultimately, you may get to the point where you can recline fully with the top of your head resting against your legs and your forearms and palms against the floor.\nHold the fold for 5 to 10 deep breaths, then slowly raise your torso to a seated position on an inhale.",
                "Transition between cat and cow. The cat-cow flow stretches and relaxes your spine as well as stretching out your torso. This relaxing exercise is done as a vinyasa flow, with a breath for each movement.[3]\n\nStart this pose on all fours, with your knees directly below your hips and your ankles in line with your shoulders. Roll your shoulders back, allowing your shoulder blades to melt back alongside your spine.\nAs you inhale, arch your back, drawing your navel towards the floor and opening your chest. This is the \"cow\" position.\nWhen you exhale, reverse the movement starting with your tail bone. Drop your tail bone towards the floor and your navel toward your spine, curving your back upward and lowering your head slightly. This is the \"cat\" position.\nRepeat this flow for 10 to 15 breath cycles, feeling the stretch in your spine.",
                "Rest in child's pose. Child's pose is the ultimate resting position in yoga, and will give you full body relaxation to calm your nervous system and help ease digestive troubles. You may want a block or pillow for your head.[4]\n\nStart by sitting on your knees, legs wide apart and big toes touching. On an exhale, reach forward and fold over your thighs, resting your forehead on the floor and reaching out ahead of you. Keep your hips lowered against your heels.\nIf you're coming from all fours, slowly lower your hips back to your heels on an exhale, reaching forward with your hands as you lower.\nHold this position for at least five deep breaths. If it feels good, you can hold this gentle pose as long as you want.\nIf you have abdominal cramps, you can ease them by adding a twist to child's pose. Simply walk your hands to the left, hold for 10 to 15 breath cycles, then slowly move back to center and repeat on the other side.[5]",
                "Use downward facing dog to warm yourself up. Downward facing dog engages your whole body to get your circulation flowing, while the inversion can help relax your nervous system and encourage improved digestion.[6]\n\nIf you're moving from child's pose, rise up to all fours with your legs about hip-width apart and your wrists in line with your shoulders. Your knees should be directly in line with your hips, so you make a tabletop shape.\nTuck your toes under your heels, and on an exhale lift your hips up to the ceiling. Straighten your legs as much as possible, pressing your heels towards the floor. Make sure your neck is not crunched. You can gaze through your legs or toward your navel.\nStay in downward facing dog for four or five breath cycles, thinking about lifting with each exhale and pressing down with every inhale.",
                "Release spinal tension with a standing forward bend. A standing forward bend helps further warm up your belly while relieving tension all the way down your spine. This also may help stimulate digestion and ease bloating.[7]\n\nStart this position from a standing position, big toes together and heels slightly apart. You also can have your feet about hip-width apart if you find that is easier for you.\nOn an exhale, fold forward from your hips, engaging a core and maintaining a flat back as long as possible before you fold into yourself.\nIdeally, you will end with your palms flat on the ground, fingertips in line with your toes. If you aren't that flexible yet, just fold as far as you comfortably can and rest your palms on a block, or on your shins or knees.\nHold this fold for 10 breath cycles, then on an inhale slowly rise and return to stand.",
                "Practice breathing deeply. Deep breathing has a relaxing effect on your whole body and also can help stimulate digestive processes to relieve cramps, gas, and bloating. It's most effective to take some time to get in touch with your breath both before and after you practice yoga.[8]\n\nCome to a comfortable seated position with your back straight, heart over pelvis, shoulder blades melting down along your spine. Relax your face and neck and close your eyes or soften your gaze.\nBegin by inhaling deeply through your nose, lifting your chest and expanding your belly to take in as much air as possible.\nPause after your inhale, then exhale slowly through your mouth, making a whispered \"ha\" sound in the back of your throat. With practice, you'll be able to make this relaxing sound while exhaling through your nose.\nTry to clear your mind and focus on your breath. Let your awareness of the sounds around you slowly fade. Stay here for at least five minutes.",
                "Try the 'Apanasana' pose. The word \"Apanasana\" means \"wind-relieving\" in Sanskrit, so this may become your go-to pose to debloat using yoga, particularly if you're feeling gassy. You may want to make sure you have some privacy before you attempt this pose.[9]\n\nLie on your back with your legs extended. Slowly draw your knees up and into your chest. You can hold your knees with your hands and rock from side to side to give your lower back and spine a good massage.\nLower and extend your left leg, keeping your right knee against your chest. Flex through your left foot, pressing the top of your left thigh towards the ground. Breathe deeply for 10 to 15 breath cycles, then switch legs.\nYou also can hold this pose with both knees against your chest at the same time.",
                "Do a supine twist. Twists increase circulation to your abdomen, stimulating digestion and encouraging the release of gas to ease bloating. This twist can be done directly from Apanasana, or you can create a flow between the two poses.[10]\n\nOn your back with your right knee against your chest as in Apanasana, roll your hips to twist your right knee to the left. You can put your left hand on top of your right knee to deepen the stretch, but don't force it.\nExtend your right arm out to your side from your shoulder and hold the twist for 10 breath cycles. Slowly return to center and repeat on the other side.\nYou also can do this twist while seated, by crossing one leg over the other and twisting your torso in the other direction.[11]",
                "Use the eagle twist to help your stomach relax. The eagle twist can increase the side-to-side flexibility in your spine, as well as loosening up your stomach and other abdominal organs to ease cramps as well as bloating.[12]\n\nStart by lying on your back with your knees up, feet flat on the floor. Cross your left leg over your right, wrapping your left toes around the back of your right ankle to twist your legs together.\nYour arms should be extended out to the sides from your shoulder, with your palms facing up and your elbows at 90-degree angles, so your hands are on either side of your head.\nOn an exhale, lower both knees to the left slowly. Try to rest them on the floor, but take care to keep your shoulders pressed to the floor. Turn your head to the right.\nHold the twist for at least 10 breath cycles. With every exhale, try to deepen the twist a little more. Feel the stretch in your spine.\nWhen you're ready, engage your core to lift your knees back to center, then repeat in the opposite direction.",
                "Rest in \"burrito\" pose. While this clearly isn't a Sanskrit word or traditional yoga pose, the burrito pose is a gentle, calming pose that can help ease gas, cramps, and bloating. It also gives you a chance to relax your whole body.[13]\n\nRoll a blanket or towel into a burrito shape and place it on the floor. Lay down over the roll, with the blanket under your navel. Make sure the roll isn't so thick that it presses into your ribs or your hip bones.\nLower yourself flat on the floor, placing a block or pillow under your head for support if necessary. Breathe deeply for 10 to 15 breath cycles or even longer, releasing all tension and feeling your body sink into the floor.",
                "Stretch your belly with the seated heart opener. If you've had a large meal and are feeling bloated or overly full, the seated heart opener can help ease stomach cramps and give you more room for the food to digest.[14]\n\nSit on your heels or on the edge of a chair. Lean back, placing your palms behind you with your fingertips pointed away from you. Press into the ground or seat of the chair with all four corners of your palms, arching your back and lifting your chest.\nHold this position for five breath cycles, then slowly return to center and place your hands on your thighs. If you want to deepen the stretch and open your chest further, drop your head back behind you, arching your neck.",
                "Use the bridge pose to aid blood flow. The bridge pose increases blood flow to your abdomen and strengthens your abdominal muscles to ease cramps and aid in digestion. You can make a vinyasa of this pose or you can simply hold it for five breaths, then release.[15]\n\nStart by lying on your back with your arms down your sides and your shoulder blades tucked under and into your back. Your feet should be flat on the floor near your fingertips, knees bent.\nOn an inhale, lift your hips up toward the sky, your chest toward your chin. Make sure your neck is soft and not crunched. On an exhale, slowly lower your hips to the floor.\nYou also can alternate hips to better stimulate and massage your digestive system.",
                "Twist and bend with open triangle pose. The twisting and bending detoxifies and stimulates your intestinal tract to help alleviate bloating. If you're not as flexible, you may need to use a yoga block or other prop to maintain proper alignment in this pose.[16]\n\nCome to a stand and walk or jump your feet wide apart. Turn your right toes out to the right and straighten your right leg. Your left leg should remain facing forward. You may even want to turn your left foot inward so you're a little pigeon-toed, for some extra stability.\nOn an exhale, slowly lower your right arm towards the floor, taking care to keep your back neutral and in line with your pelvis, rather than folding forward. You can rest your right hand on the floor, or on a block or your shin.\nLift your left arm up towards the ceiling, forming a straight line from the tips of your right fingers to the tips of your left fingers. Stay in this position for five breath cycles, lifting with every inhale and deepening the twist with every exhale. Keep your neck long and soft.\nOn an inhale, slowly lift back to center and repeat on the other side.",
                "Engage your abdominal muscles with bow pose. The bow pose will stretch your torso as well as strengthening your abdominal muscles to massage your intestinal organs and help you debloat. Do not do this pose if you cannot breathe through it.[17]\n\nStart this pose lying on your belly. Bend your knees and reach back to grab each of your ankles. Point or flex your feet and lift off the floor as high as you can, shifting your weight forward. The arch point should be your navel, not your pelvis. Curve your back and open your chest.\nHold this pose for five smooth, deep breaths if you can. If your breath is shaky or you find yourself holding your breath, allow yourself to recline back to your belly.",
                "Create a flow with down dog, up dog, and bow pose. These three poses combined together with a breath for each movement will really get the blood flowing to your abdomen and massage your abdominal organs to get your digestion moving.[18]\n\nStart on all fours with your knees hip-width apart and your hands directly below your shoulders. On an exhale, lift your hips toward the ceiling and press up into downward facing dog.\nAs you inhale, lower back down to all fours and pull forward, lifting and opening your chest for a full breath.\nAs you exhale, bend your knees and lift your chest, reaching backward to grab your ankles. Press your shoulder blades down your back along your spine, keeping your shoulders back and flat, your neck long and smooth.\nLower yourself slowly to the floor as you inhale and return to all fours. Exhale and lift into downward facing dog to repeat the flow. Try to repeat it four or five times."

        "How to Support a Family Member with a Disability": {
            "intro": "There are millions of people with some sort of disability. As a result, most people have either a friend or family member with a disability. While disabilities are relatively common, they come with a wide variety of challenges. Family members who wish to support their relatives may face a number of challenges. Ultimately, with a little knowledge, you'll be equipped to support your family member both physically and emotionally.",
            "steps": [
                "Pay attention to your family member's needs. Whether you live with the person you’re helping or if you just visit them from time to time, keep an eye on them to see if they need or want physical or emotional assistance. After all, if you don’t know what’s going on with your family member, you won’t be able to help them.\n\n\nIf the person lives with you, watch them to see if they need help.\nIf you don’t live with the person, you should call or contact them regularly to see if they’re okay and if they need help.\nAlways make sure to respect your family member’s privacy and personal space.[1]\n\nHow closely they need to be monitored depends on their age, needs, and amount of care received from other people. For example, a young, nonverbal autistic child will need more help than a fully verbal, semi-independent autistic adult.",
                "Provide need-based assistance. Depending on the specific disability, you can support your family member by offering assistance. Assistance can come in the form of physical help, emotional support, or short-term/long-term planning.\n\n\nTailor your help to the needs you observe or hear about. For example, if your relative uses a wheelchair and has good hand strength, it would be appropriate to ask if they'd like you to move a chair out of their way, but it wouldn't be appropriate to offer to cut up their food. If they say they can do it, let them do it, and don't insist on \"helping.\"\nIf offering emotional support, think about spending time doing activities your relative enjoys.[2]",
                "Respond to a request for help or support appropriately. A very important part of providing help to a family member with a disability is the way you respond to requests for help from that person. This is important, because if you don’t respond in an appropriate way, that person won’t feel comfortable asking for help or confiding in you.\n\n\nIf your relative asks for help with a specific activity, try to help them as soon as you can. Try not to put it off so long that the person no longer needs your help.\nAlways be polite and gracious when the person asks for assistance. Avoid saying things like “I’m sort of busy, but I can help.” You don't want them to feel bad for having a disability. Instead, just say, \"Sure, what can I do?\"\nMake sure you are pleasant and seem enthusiastic when you are helping or talking to your relative. Ultimately, if your relative feels like they are putting you out, they won’t want your support.[3] Keep in mind that it may be difficult and take a lot for them to ask for help.",
                "Help your relative acquire any special equipment or resources they might need. Your relative might need disability-related resources that they don’t already have. In this case, you should do what you can to help them get the equipment or resources.\n\n\nConsider applying for grants for resources or equipment for your relative.\nSee if your relative is eligible for benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, their health insurance, or other similar parties.\nIf your relative is a veteran, they might be eligible for equipment or resources from the Veterans Administration. Help them navigate the bureaucracy of the VA to get their benefits.\nDon’t feel obligated to spend money you don’t have.[4]",
                "Demonstrate love and compassion. Ultimately, one of the most important things you’ll need to do when helping a family member with a disability is to show that you love and care about them. Without showing love and compassion, your family member may feel uncomfortable or unhappy.\n\n\nTry to do little things from time to time that might go above and beyond just help or emotional support. If you help a person who is immobile get food or go to the doctors, perhaps think about bringing them to their favorite restaurant or bringing them takeout.\nAlways accept them for who they are. Don’t dismiss them and don’t dislike them because of their disability. Try to view your relative as just another person with particular needs or challenges.[5]",
                "Plan family events thoughtfully. One of the best ways to support your disabled relative is to plan family events thoughtfully. Whenever you plan an event, make sure to consider you relative's disability. Ultimately, you want them to be able to participate in family events just like everyone else.\n\n\nConsult with your relative or their primary caregiver about what locations work the best or locations that the disabled relative enjoys visiting.\nBe thoughtful when planning the time of the event. If your relative is best able to enjoy and participate in family activities in the morning or in the afternoon, plan for that time of day. If they have doctors appointments, plan around those appointments.\nPick activities that your family member can most participate. If they are hard of hearing, avoid noisy restaurants. If they are immobile, pick an activity that does not require much mobility.[6]",
                "Research your family member’s condition. Because there are so many types of disabilities, you’ll have to put a bit of effort into researching your family member’s condition so you know what you need to do to help them. While spending time learning about the disability might seem like work, it will pay dividends in the future because you’ll have a much better understanding of your relative’s needs and the challenges that they face on a daily basis.\n\n\nDisabilities can be physical. The main type of disability people think of when they think of people with disabilities are physical disabilities that restrict mobility.\nDisabilities can be emotional or psychological. An increasing number of people are being diagnosed with emotional or psychological disabilities. One common psychological disability is post-traumatic stress disorder.\nDisabilities can be developmental. Many people also experience learning disabilities. People with learning disabilities might require tutoring or extra help when it comes to making life choices or even choices on a daily basis.[7]",
                "Cultivate your patience. Ultimately, for many people who help relatives with disabilities, patience is an important virtue. Patience is necessary when dealing with many types of disabilities. This is important, because some people with disabilities (like everyone else) might not always acknowledge how much your support means to them.\n\n\nAvoid thinking about time constraints when you are helping or supporting someone with a disability.\nIf you’re feeling really frustrated, chances are that the disabled person is frustrated too. You might be dealing with this when you're with them, but they have to handle it for their entire lives.",
                "Evaluate what sort of support you can offer. While you may want to offer physical, financial, or emotional support, the amount of help you can offer your relative may be limited. This is why it is important to prepare to help your relative by evaluating what you can actually offer. Make sure to consider:\n\n\nYour financial limitations.\nTime constraints and other obligations, like work or caring for young children.\nIf you can’t offer time, you may be able to offer financial help. If you can’t offer financial help, you may be able to offer time. If you can't offer either, maybe you can simply check in on your relative from time to time and spend a few minutes on the phone with them.",
                "Ask your family member if they need support. Instead of offering unsolicited assistance, you should ask your family member if they want physical or emotional support. Asking if they need and want you involved will enable you to provide help without being presumptuous and without your relative having to request help.\n\n\nSay something like \"If you ever need help, you can count on me,\" or \"If you ever need someone to talk to, please call me.\"\nOffer both general and specific help. Sometimes people may be shy about asking for help, or might not know where to start. It can help to offer \"Would you like me to guide you to the restroom?\" or, \"What if I came over at 6:00 with some gluten-free lasagna?\"\nAsking your family member if they need support will allow you to initiate a conversation about their disability without you indirectly telling them that they need help.[8]",
                "Listen to the person. When communicating with a person about their disability, the most important thing is to listen to them. Without listening, you won’t understand their challenges and concerns. Ultimately, listening to the person you are helping will enable you to provide help that is truly needed and appreciated.\n\n\nListening to a person and allowing them to give feedback will validate their personhood.\nWhen listening to your family member, avoid thinking about what you are going to say next. Try to truly clear your mind. Focus on listening.\nWait until your relative is finished to respond. Allow them the full opportunity to talk.[9]",
                "Coordinate with other family members. Another great way to support your disabled family member is to make sure that the rest of your family is on board with your plan. In order to do this, you should communicate with other family members and coordinate events and care to better support your disabled relative.\n\n\nIf you're not the primary caregiver, make sure to stay in regular contact with the caregiver. The primary caregiver is probably the person who knows the needs and challenges of the disabled person best (next to the disabled person).\nIf your disabled family member requires substantial amount of financial support, talk to your other family members about setting up a pool to share the cost of their expenses.\nIf your disabled family member needs emotional support and companionship, talk to your family to make sure someone is always available to offer support.[10]"

        "How to Avoid Falling for Your Ex Boyfriend": {
            "intro": "Even if you have recently broken up with your boyfriend for entirely justifiable reasons, you may still suffer the pain of regret and find yourself asking \"Did I do the right thing?\". Love is, in many ways, an addiction, and is therefore hard to break.[1] You may even find yourself considering getting back together with your ex. This is very rarely a good idea; you are almost always better off utilizing methods of avoidance, compensation, and replacement to break the connection with your ex and move forward into a new and better relationship.",
            "steps": [
                "Stay away from him. When it comes to dealing with the fallout of a breakup, follow the motto, \"Out of sight, out of mind.\" The less you run into your ex, the better. There may be times when you're forced to see him or you run into him by accident. Outside of these times, do your best to avoid contact.[2]\n\nIn today's world, \"staying away\" also means cutting off contact via social media. Unfriend him, stop following his posts, delete his number in your phone. Break the chain that connects you, at least temporarily. You can possibly reconsider making some new connections later on.[3]\n\nAvoiding him isn't a way of showing that you hate your old partner. Instead, you're showing that being around this person makes you feel confusing, uncomfortable emotions (which is most likely true).",
                "Avoid his friends when you can. Breaking up can be especially hard if you were used to spending lots of time with his friends. However, if you can, limit your exposure to these people. Being around your ex's friends will only remind you of the memories you shared with your ex and you will have trouble getting over him.[4]\n\nCutting off contact with these friends will probably only exacerbate your sense of loss, but it is a pain you need to go through in order to get past your ex and move forward. You may be able to reconnect with some of these friends later on.\nIf you don't have many friends who aren't close to your ex, hang out with a few of your most trusted friends that you can count on to be sympathetic. You may also want to try to focus your efforts on making new friends (though this can be tough if you're feeling blue).",
                "Avoid places and activities that may trigger temptation. It may be hard to (at least temporarily) give up your favorite restaurant, or listening to your favorite band, or doing the crossword in the Sunday paper, but if these are things you shared with your boyfriend, they could become temptation traps. You might associate such things so strongly with him that you can't help but pine for him.\n\n\nRemember, you're trying to break a type of addiction, and if you were trying to quit drinking, you wouldn't hang out at your favorite bar.[5]\n\nEventually you should be able to reclaim favorite places and things for yourself, but it is best to play it safe by not risking temptation while your breakup is still fresh.\nThe worst-case scenario would be running into your ex at your favorite restaurant or the first spot where you kissed, so avoidance is the most prudent option.",
                "Stay polite but distant when you can't avoid contact. Sometimes, you may be forced to see your ex face-to-face. Maybe he's in your biology class, or lives down the street, or works at your local grocery store. In these cases, it's not worth your effort to make a scene or try to hurt his feelings. Instead, smile and be pleasant, but keep your conversations short. Doing this will help prevent him from bringing back any difficult emotions.[6]\n\nDespite its common existence in sitcoms and other forms of popular culture, it is rarely a good idea to be \"just friends\" with your ex. If he was at fault for the breakup, you are only minimizing or even validating his mistreatment of you by deeming him worthy of friendship. Even if the breakup was mutual or faultless, you'll find it even more difficult to escape the \"addiction\" of your romantic feelings for him if he's always around as a friend.\nRemember, happiness is the best revenge. If you're angry at your ex over the breakup, showing him that you're doing well without him is a great way to subtly show him the mistake he's made.",
                "Don't view your relationship through rose-colored glasses. In the time after a breakup, it can be difficult to think about your old relationship logically. Give yourself a few days to mourn, but then try to see things how they really were. The simple fact that you broke up in the first place means that your relationship wasn't perfect. Remembering the bad parts of the relationship alongside the good will make it a lot harder to fall for your ex again.[7]\n\nNot sure what went wrong? Search your heart. Be honest with yourself. Was one of you unhappy? Did you have different life priorities? Was there a lack of trust? Were you treated with respect? Were you betrayed?\nHonestly examining a past relationship can not only help you move on from it, but also better prepare you for the next one by helping you to identify potential problems and \"warning signs\" ahead of time.",
                "Don't devote yourself to getting revenge. After a nasty breakup, the urge to get even with your ex may be strong. You may start to think that bashing up his car or embarrassing him in front of his new partner are good ideas. They aren't. This sort of behavior shows that you're still obsessed with your old partner. To others, it can seem petty and childish, leading to embarrassment for you in the long run. Don't give in to hate. Instead, work to get over your ex so that you never have to think about him again.[8]\n\nDepending on why you broke up in the first place, you may even feel guilty after a mean-spirited prank. If your boyfriend cheated on you, you may indeed hate his guts. If he never betrayed your trust, though, and you broke up after a fight or something similar, you may not really want to see him unhappy.\nThe minuscule rush you may feel after exacting your revenge on your ex can never make up for the extra time you wasted obsessing over him instead of moving on with your life. In almost every case, revenge is not \"a dish best served cold\"; it is a dish best not served at all.",
                "Distract yourself with things you enjoy. After a breakup, it's OK to treat yourself a little. Not only will this make you feel better, it's also good for resisting the urge to spend time with your ex. When you're at home feeling down and starting to think that a reunion would be a good idea, divert your attention to something you know you love. Basically, you want to replace one \"addiction\" for another, healthier one.[9]\n\nFor example, you can try putting on your favorite music, baking your favorite pastry, or playing your favorite sport. With luck, you won't be thinking about your ex for long.\nConsider relying on portable distractions when you get wistful for your ex outside of the house (like, for example, on the train). Playing music, movies, or games on your phone, or putting a good old-fashioned book in your backpack, can be very useful for this.",
                "Stay off the topic of boys when you're with your friends. Spending time with your most trusted friends is a fantastic idea after a breakup. However, some topics of conversation aren't very helpful. Try to avoid talking about boys when you're hanging out. Your ex is especially off limits, but boys and romance in general should also be avoided. Hearing your friends talk about their partners can make you miss your ex, even if he has nothing to do with these people.\n\n\nThis can, understandably, be a little awkward to bring up. It's OK to say something like, \"Hey, do you mind if we don't talk about boys tonight?\" Your friends should get the idea, but if they don't, you might follow up with something a little more pointed, like \"I'm just trying to get my mind off the subject.\"\nWatch out for what is known as the \"white bear\" example, though. (The name comes from the idea that if someone tells you not to think of a white bear, the first image likely to pop into your head is a white bear.) If you make too big a deal about not talking about your ex or boys/relationships in general, you may inadvertently steer the conversation that way.[10]",
                "Focus on the positives of being single. Though it may not seem like it at first, being without a partner can have some major benefits. Keeping these in mind will make getting back with your partner seem much less appealing.[11] Here are just a few things the newly-single you can be happy about, guilt-free:\n\n\nYou now get to spend more of your money on yourself.\nYou now have time to pursue more of your favorite hobbies and interests.\nYou no longer have to do things that you don't like just to make your partner happy.\nYou don't have to hang out with any of your partner's unappealing friends.\nYou are now free to pursue other, even better guys.",
                "Keep active. Breaking up can leave you feeling depressed and sapped of energy for a while. As soon as you can, take the opportunity to get up, get out of the house, and start being active in all of your favorite ways. Physical exercise is especially valuable as it has proven anti-depressant effects.[12]\n\nHowever, almost any sort of activity is a good idea. Simply venturing outdoors and doing something can make you feel better.[13]\n\nKeep your mind and body busy by volunteering, tackling a home improvement project, or some other tasks that force your mind away from your ex. Eventually, by giving your mind other options to focus on, the urge to think about your ex will diminish and vanish.",
                "Don't be afraid to check out other guys. Even if you broke up on good terms, your ex isn't the only good guy in the world. There are good people everywhere, but it's up to you to meet them! Don't let yourself get into the mindset that your ex was the only one you can ever love. As soon as you feel those familiar \"sparks\" with someone new, you'll realize just how wrong you were.[14]\n\nYou may be concerned about getting into a \"rebound\" relationship, perhaps with someone who isn't as good as you deserve or someone who is too much like your ex (and acting almost as a replacement). You may want to take some time before getting involved with someone else, but that doesn't mean you can't look! Have fun \"scouting\" the area before you decide to wade back into the dating waters."

        "How to Speak Elvish": {
            "intro": "Elvish is a fictional language originally created by J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. There are two major Elvish dialects—Quenya and Sindarin—and you'll have to figure out which one you want to learn before you begin. Either way, learning Elvish can be a challenging process, but it can also be fun and rewarding. Keep reading to learn more.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn a bit about Quenya Elvish. Quenya is one of two major languages spoken by the Elves. In particular, it is the language of the High Elves.\n\n\nQuenya has gone through a few changes since its creation. Early Quenya, also called \"Classical Quenya\" or \"First Age Quenya,\" was the earliest form of the language.\nMost Quenya you will learn online or in books will be \"Modern Quenya\" or \"Third Age Quenya.\" This version is a blend of vocabulary and grammar original to Tolkien with a bit of reconstruction from contemporary fans.",
                "Know how to pronounce the vowels. Quenya vowels have distinct pronunciations that do not vary based upon position or placement within words. Long and short vowels differ in terms of length, not quality or formation, and long vowels are distinguished with an accent mark.\n\n\ná = long “aaaah”\na = short “ah”\né = long “eeeh”\ne = short “eh”\ní = long “ee”\ni = short “ih”\nó = long “oooh”\no = short “o” (almost like a short \"ah\")\nú = long “uuuh” (almost like a long \"ooo\")\nu = short “uh”",
                "Note then Quenya diphthongs. A diphthong refers to a set of two vowels that form a single sound. There are only six in Quenya, and other vowels, when combined side-by-side, should be pronounced separately. The diphthongs are:\n\n\nai (\"aisle\")\nau (\"house\")\neu (British \"so\")\niu (\"yule\")\noi (\"oil\")\nui (\"ruin\")",
                "Keep certain consonant peculiarities in mind. Most consonants are pronounced in the same way as they are in English, but there are a few particular rules you should be aware of.\n\n\nc = always pronounced as “k”\nh = pronounced as “h” when placed at the beginning of a word and and as “ch” or \"k\" when placed between consonants; silent in the combinations: hw, hy, hl, hr\nng = both sounds are always heard, as in “finger”, not as in “singer”\nr = most be rolled or trilled\ns = always unvoiced\ny = always a hard consonant, no matter where in a word it is placed\nqu = “kw”; the “u” in this combination does not act as a vowel",
                "Understand the rules of stress. Knowing which syllables to stress will impact the way that Elvish sounds.\n\n\nWhen there are two syllables, stress the first.\nWhen there are three or more syllables, stress the one that falls third to last. This is true unless the second to last syllable contains a long vowel, diphthong, or short vowel followed by a consonant cluster (multiple consonants side by side), in which case, the second to last is stressed.",
                "Know how to greet someone. There are multiple ways to greet someone using Quenya, and some are simpler than others.\n\n\n\nAiya (/'aj.ja/) means \"Hail!\" when calling for help or attention.\n\nAlla (/'al.la/) means \"Hail!\" when issuing a blessing in greeting.\n\nAlatulya (/a.ˈla.tu.lʲa/) means \"Welcome.\"\n\nElen síla lúmenn' omentielvo (/ˈɛ.lɛn ˈsi:.la lu:.ˈmɛn nɔ.mɛn.ti.ˈɛl.vɔ/) means \"A star shines on the hour of our meeting.\"",
                "Know how to say goodbye. Just like there are many ways to say hello in Quenya Elvish, there are many ways to say goodbye or farewell.\n\n\n\nNamárië (/na.ˈma:.ri.ɛ/) means \"be well!\"\n\nMárienna (/ma:.ri.ˈɛn.na/) means \"farewell\" or \"towards happiness.\"\n\nAlámenë (/a.ˈla:.mɛ.nɛ/) means \"Go with our blessings.\"\n\nMauya nin avánië (/ˈmau.ja ˈnin a.ˈva:.ni.ɛ/) means \"I must go.\"",
                "Ask someone if he or she speaks Elvish. Whether you want to practice your Quenya or want to show off what you do know, you might need to ask someone if she or he speaks Elvish. Asking in Quenya will imply that you mean Quenya Elvish, specifically.\n\n\nAsk Ma istal quet' Eldarin? (/ˈma ˈis.tal ˈkʷɛ ˈtɛl.da.rin/).\nIf someone asks you this question, you can tell him or her that you speak Elvish with Istan quet' Eldarin (/ˈis.tan ˈkʷɛ ˈtɛl.da.rin/).",
                "Issue an Elvish insult. If you want to teasingly dish out a unique insult, try a creative Quenya option.\n\n\nWish someone bad luck with Aica umbar! (/ˈaj.ka ˈum.bar/).\nTell someone \"wind pours from your mouth\" with Súrë túla cendeletyallo (/ˈsu:.rɛ ˈtu:.la kɛn.dɛ.lɛ.ˈtʲal.lɔ/).\nSay \"Go French kiss an orc\" with Eca, a mitta lambetya cendelessë orcova (/ˈɛ.ka ˌa ˈmit.ta ˈlam.bɛ.tʲa kɛn.dɛ.ˈlɛs.sɛ ˈɔr.kɔ.va/).",

                "Say thanks. In keeping with the polite spirit of the Elves, you should know how to lend a well-deserved word of thanks.\n\n\nTell someone a simple \"thank you\" with Hantanyel (/ˈhan.ta.nʲɛl/).",
                "Learn about Sindarin Elvish. Sindarin is the other major language spoken by the Elves. In particular, it is the language of the Grey Elves.\n\n\nAs with Quenya, Sindarin went through a few changes of its own from the First Age of Middle Earth to the Third Age.\nWhile you can find resources on First Age Sindarin, most of what you'll find online or in print is Third Age Sindarin, which is considered to be Sindarin in its modern form.",
                "Know how to pronounce the vowels. All Sindarin vowels are short except for the \"í\" vowel. The duration of these short vowel sounds increases when an accent mark is used, however. Vowels are almost always pronounced the same way no matter where they appear in a word, even if they appear at the end.\n\n\na = pronounced like \"ay\"\ne = pronounced like \"eh\"\ni = pronounced like \"ih\"; if placed at the beginning of a word and in front of another vowel, though, it has a hard \"y\" sound\ní and î = pronounced like “ee”\no = pronounced like a short \"o,\" similar to the \"ah\" noise but more rounded\nu = pronounced like \"uh\"\ny = always treated as a vowel, and pronounced \"ooo\" or \"uuu\"",
                "Note then Sindarin diphthongs. When one of the six Sindarin diphthongs appears, it has a single sound. Otherwise, vowels appearing in clusters or side by side should be pronounced separately. For diphthongs, the stress is always on the first element.\n\n\nai = pronounced like \"aye\" (\"rye\")\nei = pronounced like \"ay\" (“grey”)\nui = pronounced like the \"eeoo\" (“pursuing”)\nau (sometimes aw) = pronounced like \"ouw\" (“loud”)\nae = also similar to \"aye\" (“rye”)\noe = pronounced like \"oy\" (\"boy\")",
                "Keep certain consonant peculiarities in mind. Most consonants are pronounced as they are in English, but there are a few specifics you should take note of. Some consonants are voiced, meaning they require you to vibrate your vocal cords, while others do not and are unvoiced. Additionally, al double consonants have a longer sound than single consonants.\n\n\nc = always sounds like \"k\"\nch = always sounds like \"k,\" never the English \"ch\"; considered a single consonant\ndh = represents the voiced \"th\"; considered a single consonant.\nf = at the end of words, it is used to represent the \"v\" sound\ng = always a hard \"g,\" never the \"j\" sound\nl = voice \"l\" sound\nlh = voiceless \"l\" sound\n\"ng\" = not very pronounced at the end or start of a word, but more pronounced in the middle of words\nph = \"f\" sound\nr = always rolled or trilled\nrh = voiceless \"r\" sound\ns = voiceless \"s\"\nth = voiceless \"th\"; considered a single consonant.\nv = silent when it appears at the end of a word\nhw = voiceless W",
                "Learn how to stress Sindarin words correctly. There are three basic rules to remember when learning how to place stress on the right part of a Sindarin word.\n\n\nWhen a word has two syllables, the stress goes on the first.\nWhen a word has three or more syllables, the stress goes on the second to last syllable if it contains a long vowel, diphthong, or vowel followed by a string of multiple consonants.\nWhen a word has three or more syllables, and the second to last syllable has a short vowel followed by only one or no consonants, the stress falls on the syllable before it.",
                "Know how to greet someone. There are a variety of Sindarin phrases you can use to say hello, ranging from simple to elaborate.\n\n\n\nAi! (/ˈaj/) means \"Hail!\"\n\nÊl síla erin lû e-govaned vîn (/ˈɛ:l̡ ˈsiˑ.la ˈɛ.rin ˈlu: ɛ ˈgɔ.va.nɛd ˈvi:n/) means \"A star shines on the hour of our meeting.\"\n\nMae g'ovannen! (/ˈmaɛ gɔ.ˈvan.nɛn/) means \"You are well met\" in a familiar/casual sense.\n\nMae l'ovannen!

                "Ask someone if he or she speaks Elvish. If you want to practice or show off your Elvish and want to know if the person in front of you is another student of the language, you can ask them in Sindarin Elvish.\n\n\nAsk Pedig edhellen? (/ˈpɛ.dig ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/) when speaking in familiar terms, or Pedil edhellen? (/ˈpɛ.dil̡ ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/) when speaking formally.\nIf someone asks you this question, tell that person you speak Elvish by saying Pedin edhellen (/ˈpɛ.din ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/).",
                "Issue an Elvish insult. There are times when an insult in your native language just doesn't cut it.

                "Issue an Elvish compliment. Just as there are various Sindarin insults, there are also a range of common Sindarin compliments to select from.\n\n\nTell someone, \"I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh\" by saying Gellon ned i galar i chent gîn ned i gladhog (/ˈgɛl̡.lɔn ˈnɛd i ˈga.lar i ˈxɛnt ˈgi:n ˈnɛd i ˈgla.ðɔg/).\nSay \"I love you\" by saying Gi melin (/gi ˈmɛ.lin/).",
                "Say thanks. Elves are a polite race, so keeping in Elvish spirit, you should know how to thank someone after he or she does something kind.\n\n\nSay a simple \"thank you\" with Ni 'lassui (/ˈni ˈlas.suj/).",
                "Look for guides online or in print. There are a surprising number of websites and books available that will help you learn either Quenya or Sindarin Elvish in even greater detail. Many online guides are free, and most of the books currently out in the market are pretty affordable, as well.\n\n\nWhen shopping around for books on Elvish, invest in an English-Elvish dictionary to help you translate specific terms, as well as language guides that will help you learn the grammar.\nIf you want an English-Elvish dictionary but don't want to buy one, there are a few you can find for free online.[4]\n\nYou can find a free Quenya workbook online here: http://www.councilofelrond.com/readingcats/quenya-workbook/\n\nYou can find a free Sindarin workbook online here: http://www.councilofelrond.com/readingcats/sindarin-workbook-updated/",
                "Practice by yourself.[5] Workbooks are great tools, but once you get a basic understanding of Elvish, the next thing you need to do to really make the language stick is to start translating things on your own.\n\n\nYou can translate anything you want: poems, short stories, names, articles, or text messages. Start small before working your way up to longer passages.",
                "Practice with other Elvish enthusiasts. Once you think that you have a pretty solid understanding of Elvish, you should find others who speak Elvish and practice with them.\n\n\nThe easiest, cheapest way to go about this is by searching for Elvish communities online. Most of these forums and boards are free.\nYou could also search for conventions or local fan groups that have something to do with Elves, since many hardcore fans will have learned a bit of Elvish here and there."

            "intro": "Neuropathy is a disease affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Your PNS controls body movements, sensations, and automatic functions like blood pressure and sweating. If your nerves are damaged, a variety of symptoms may appear depending on the type of nerves that are damaged. Neuropathy in feet affects 2.4% of the population and 8% of people over age 55 experience the disease.[1] Diabetes is a leading cause, but neuropathy can be inherited or caused by infections, other diseases, and trauma. For this reason, it's important to work with your doctor to manage treatment.",
            "steps": [
                "Walk regularly. Try to walk outside at least three times a week. Or, do an exercise that is safe and comfortable for you. You can ask your doctor to recommend a proper exercise regimen. Exercise will improve your blood flow and nourish damaged nerves. Walking reduces your overall blood sugar levels and makes diabetes easier to control. If you successfully control your diabetes, your neuropathy will lessen.[2]\n\nIf you struggle with setting aside time to exercise, remember that you can take small steps to be active. For example, you can clean up the house, play with the dog, or hand wash your car. All of these will get your blood flowing.",
                "Soak your feet. Fill a small container or tub with warm water and add 1/4 cup of Epsom salt for each cup of water. Make sure the water isn't over 100 degrees. Set your feet in the container or tub so that the water covers them. The warmth of the water can relax you and distract from the pain in your feet. And, Epsom salts contain magnesium which can relax your muscles.[3]\n\nIf you have an infection or swelling, ask your doctor before soaking in Epsom salts.[4]",
                "Reduce or avoid alcohol. Alcohol can be toxic to your nerves, especially if they are already damaged. You should limit yourself to four drinks spaced over the course of a week. Some forms of neuropathy are actually caused by alcoholism, so you should eliminate alcohol if you have any neuropathy.[5] Stopping drinking can relieve your symptoms and prevent more damage.[6]\n\nIf alcoholism runs in your family, you may not want to drink at all. Consider giving alcohol up entirely to stay safe and healthy.",
                "Take evening primrose oil. This natural oil found in a wildflower is available in pill form. Ask your doctor to recommend a specific dose of the supplement evening primrose oil. Studies have shown that the fatty acids it contains can improve symptoms of neuropathy.[7][8] These fatty acids improve your nerve function.\n\n\nOther sources of the beneficial fatty acid (GLA) include borage oil and black currant oil.",
                "Try acupuncture. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine in which needles are placed on specific pressure points. Stimulating these pressure points, or acupoints, causes the body to release endorphins, which soothe pain. The acupuncturist will insert four to ten needles into acupoints, and leave them there for about half an hour. You will need six to twelve sessions over a period of three months.[9]\n\nCheck the reputation of your acupuncturist before your appointment. Make sure that the facility and needles are sterile to avoid blood-borne diseases.",
                "Consider complementary and alternative therapies. In addition to acupuncture, you can try meditation and low-intensity transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for relief of neuropathy symptoms.[10] The TENS procedure uses a small battery pack to charge probes that are placed around areas where you're experiencing pain. The probes and battery create a circuit through which an electrical current passes to stimulate the area. Studies have shown that TENS is effective in treating certain kinds of neuropathic pain, although more research is needed.[11]\n\nOf meditation methods, you can try walking meditation, sitting meditation, Qigong, or Tai Chi. Studies showed pain reduction with regular meditation.[12]",
                "Take medications prescribed by your doctor. A variety of medications are available to treat neuropathy. Your doctor will focus on managing the medical disorder that's causing your neuropathy which will reduce symptoms and improve the nerve function in your feet.[13] Your doctor may prescribe:\n\n\nAmitriptyline: This medication, originally used as an antidepressant, effectively treats neuropathic pain. You'll be started on the lowest dose, 25 mg a day. You can gradually increase the dosage to 150 mg per day. Always take the medication before going to bed. This drug should not be prescribed if you have a history of suicide risk.[14]\n\nPregabalin: This sedative is usually prescribed for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. You will start with the lowest possible dose, and increase it as your doctor suggests. The maximum dosage is 50 to 100 mg, taken three times per day by mouth. Maximum dosing may be increased over time to 600mg/day, but dosage over this amount isn't effective.[15]\n\nDuloxetine: This medication is usually prescribed for pain associated with neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. The dosage starts at 60 mg orally. The dosage can be doubled and your doctor will review the treatment after two months. While you can double the dosage, most doses over 60 mg a day are rarely more effective and may actually cause other problems.[16]\n\nCombination therapies: Your doctor may recommend combining several medications such as TCA, venlafaxine, or tramadol. These can provide better results for neuropathy than any single medication alone.[17]",
                "Use opiates as prescribed. Your doctor may prescribe long-acting opiates to treat the pain of your neuropathy. This is usually determined on an individual basis, because side effects include dependence (addiction), tolerance (they become less effective over time), and headaches.[18]\n\nImmunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be prescribed to treat a chronic type of neuropathy (dysimmune neuropathy) that may be resistant to other treatments.",
                "Talk with your doctor about surgery. Depending on the cause of your neuropathy, your doctor may recommend a decompressive surgery. This will release pressure from entrapped nerves which will let them function correctly. Decompressive surgery is often done for carpal tunnel syndrome. But, certain types of hereditary neuropathy that cause issues in the foot and ankle can also benefit from decompressive surgery.\n\n\nAmyloid peripheral neuropathy may be treated by a liver transplant, since this type of neuropathy is caused by metabolic liver problems.[19]",
                "Include more vitamins in your diet. If you aren't diabetic and have no other recognizable systemic disease then the neuropathy might be caused by deficiencies of vitamins E, B1, B6, and B12.[20] However, talk with your doctor before taking a vitamin supplement. Your doctor will need to diagnose the cause of your neuropathy before advising supplements or medications.\n\n\nTo get more vitamins from a healthy diet, eat plenty of green leafy vegetables, egg yolks, and liver.",
                "Take control of diabetes. Neuropathy usually develops many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Good diabetic control can prevent or halt neuropathy. But once developed, it may not be possible to fully reverse the condition. Your doctor will focus on managing the diabetes and controlling the pain caused by neuropathy.[21]\n\nIt's important to keep your blood glucose level in check. Target blood glucose level is 70-130 mg/dL at fasting and below 180 mg/dL two hours after breakfast. You should also keep your blood pressure under control.",
                "Prevent injury and ulcer formation. You may notice less sensation and feeling in your neuropathic feet. This may make you more prone to injuries like cuts, pricks or scratches. Always wear socks or shoes when inside or outdoors. Repeated injury to your feet can easily lead to ulcer formation that is difficult to heal. You should also ask your doctor to examine your feet when you go in for regular visits.[22]\n\nUse loose fitting footwear such as a pair of backless slippers, but avoid shoes, sandals, or flip-flops that offer little support. Tight shoes may compromise adequate blood supply to pressure points of your feet and lead to ulcer formation in those areas.\nKeep your nails at a good length. This will prevent ingrown toenails. Just use caution when clipping. To avoid accidental cuts, don't use blades.",
                "Keep developed ulcers clean. Wash the ulcer area with warm salt water. Take a piece of sterile gauze and pour a little saline over it. Use this to clean the dead tissue over the ulcer. Then, dry the area and cover the ulcer with a sterile dressing. Take care to change the dressing once or twice a day, more often if it gets wet. If there is a foul smell from the ulcer, return to your doctor immediately because a bad smell indicates infection which can be serious.[23]\n\nImmediately inform your doctor that you have ulcers. If they're small, they can be treated easily with dressings and antibiotics. However, large ulcers can be difficult to heal. They can even lead to amputation of toes or feet.",
                "Control the pain. The severity of neuropathic pain varies widely. If you're experiencing mild to moderate pain, take over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. can be treated with over the counter analgesics. You may take 400 mg of ibuprofen or 300 mg of aspirin two to three times a day.[24]\n\nDo not forget to take anti-peptic drugs because the analgesics (Ibuprofen, etc.) are irritating to the stomach. For example, you could take 150mg of ranitidine twice daily before meals.",
                "Get medical treatment for underlying causes. Neuropathy due to kidney, liver or endocrine diseases can be corrected by treating the underlying disease. If you have nerve compression or local problems, it can be improved by physiotherapy or surgery.\n\n\nYou should always talk with your doctor about neuropathy you're experiencing and before taking any supplements."

        "wikiHow to Energize Yourself": {
            "intro": "Do you feel yourself running out of steam halfway through your day? Are you feeling too tired to work out, hang out with friends, or just to gather enough enthusiasm to go out at night? If so, then you need to work on energizing yourself a little more. All you've got to do is maintain a diet that maximizes your energy and try a few simple tricks to energize your mind and body. If you want to energize yourself, just follow these steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Eat a healthy breakfast. Eating a healthy breakfast is the best thing you can do to start your day off on the right foot and to energize yourself before you walk out the door. Eating a nutritious and not-too-heavy breakfast will give you the energy you need to start the day and will keep you from crashing or getting tired before noon. You should eat a balance of lean proteins, healthy veggies, and some carbs to get your day started. Avoid foods that are too sugary like muffins or too greasy like bacon and opt for something filling but healthier instead. Here are some foods that can help you feel energized:[1]\n\nOatmeal\n\nHard-boiled or sunny-side eggs made with low-fat butter\nTurkey bacon or ham\nGreens like celery, spinach, leeks, or kale\nBlackberries, raspberries, bananas, apples, or pears\nWhole wheat toast or whole wheat bagels\nCereal with low-fat milk\nYogurt and granola",
                "Eat three balanced meals. Though breakfast is the most important meal, you need to keep yourself energized throughout the day so you can continue to feel alert and motivated. Make sure to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, no matter how busy or tired you may feel. Have a balance of proteins, carbs, and fruits and veggies during all of your meals, and try not to have too heavy of a lunch, or you will feel yourself flatlining afterwards. Your dinner should be medium-sized so you don't wake up feeling too hungry, but not so heavy that you feel completely lethargic after you eat. Here are some great foods you can eat for lunch or dinner:\n\n\nLunch: salads with nuts and berries, tomato soup, turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread, salmon, polenta, and tuna with fennel.\nDinner: salmon and quinoa, whole wheat pasta and lemon chicken, brown rice and mushrooms, and couscous and turkey.",
                "Eat energizing snacks. Your three meals are important, but so are the snacks you eat throughout the day that will keep you going. You should eat something at least every 3-4 hours even if you're not particularly hungry. Try to avoid going into any of your meals feeling lightheaded or incredibly hungry, because this will undoubtedly make you lose your energy, overeat, and then get tired from eating too much. Avoid this cycle by keeping healthy and nutritious snacks on hand to keep you going throughout the day. Here are some great energizing snacks you should eat:\n\n\nGranola\nYogurt\nAlmonds, cashews, or peanuts\nA small piece of chocolate\nCelery and peanut butter\nApples and honey",
                "Eat more foods that are rich in fiber. Fiber gives you more energy throughout the day than carbs because it enters your bloodstream at a steadier pace than carbs do, so the energy it gives you can last longer. Foods that are rich in fiber can be great additions to your meals or to the snacks you eat throughout the day. Here are some foods known for being rich in fiber:[2]\n\nRye bread\nPistachios\nRaspberries\nLentils\nFigs\nLima beans\nPecans",
                "Eat foods rich in Omega 3s. You can find Omega 3 fatty acid in canola oil, fatty fish, and walnuts. Omega 3 is known for making you feel more mentally alert, and therefore more energized. You should try to eat fatty fish and walnuts at least every day or two to energize yourself.[3]",
                "Stay hydrated. If you want to energize yourself, then you have to drink at least 10 8-oz. glasses of water each day. You need to do this even if you don't feel thirsty at all if you want to keep yourself feeling alert and enthusiastic. Carry a water bottle wherever you go, and stop to drink at water fountains even if you aren't really thirsty. Have a glass of water with each meal or snack to remind yourself to stay hydrated.",
                "Take it easy on the caffeine. You don't have to stop drinking caffeine completely, but you should know that while drinking more caffeine may make you more energetic in the short-term, it'll make you feel more fatigued and tired in the long run. Try to avoid drinking coffee after noon and if you do drink caffeine, try to sip it slowly instead of downing that cup of coffee in ten minutes and then feeling the jitters.[4]The caffeine in tea can affect you a bit less harshly than the caffeine in coffee so you should try switching from coffee to tea to keep yourself from losing energy quickly.\n\n\nDrinking too much caffeine will also keep you up at night, which will lead you to wake up with less energy -- which you'll try to fight with more caffeine. Break this cycle if you want to feel more energized.\nIf you do want to wean yourself off of so much caffeine, you can do it slowly; quitting coffee cold turkey can make you feel tired and restless, especially if you're used to drinking a lot of it.",
                "Avoid drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant and it can make you feel tired and lead you to fall into a less restful sleep. If you want to energize yourself, then you may think that going out to the bars and downing five beers with your friends will make you feel more excited about life; in fact, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to feel tired and irritable -- even if you don't feel its effects right away.\n\n\nIf you do like to have a glass of wine or two in the evenings, avoid drinking alcohol less than two hours before you go to bed. It can help you fall asleep, but it will make you have a more shallow and restless sleep.[5]",
                "Exercise. Exercising will make you feel more energized, happier, and more physically fit. If you’re feeling sluggish, chances are that working out is the last thing you want to do, but that’s precisely what will make you feel more alert and alive. Just 30 minutes of exercise a day will boost your energy levels overall, not to mention that it will have marked improvements on your health. You can run every other day, take a yoga class a few times a week, join a team sport, or find a workout buddy and hit up the gym.[6]\n\nTry to be active whenever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of driving. Do some sit-ups when you’re watching TV.\nWork out in the morning. This will wake your body up and will give you more energy throughout the day.",
                "Take power naps. Power naps have been proven to wake up your body when you’re feeling a lack of energy. Just close yourself off in a dark room for 15-20 minutes, close your eyes, and let yourself drift off. Even if you don’t end up falling asleep completely, you will gain energy from resting your body. Power naps are superior to real naps; sleeping for over an hour or more will actually make you feel more tired and groggy when you wake up, and can keep you up at night.\n\n\nA good time to take a power nap can be after lunch, when you’re feeling a little tired after eating.",
                "Splash cold water on your face. Take a few handfuls of cold water and splash it on your face when you’re feeling tired. This is a great trick to wake yourself up in the morning – not to mention make yourself feel cleaner – and also for energizing yourself throughout the day.",
                "Get outside. Just being outside as much as you can has been proven to make people feel happier and more energetic. Getting some fresh air in your lungs can invigorate you and make you feel ready to embrace the day. Stepping outside or onto your balcony right after you wake up and breathing in fresh air just for a minute can make you more energized almost instantly. If you can get some sunlight, make sure to do it; instead of eating lunch at your desk, step out to get some lunch or eat it on a park bench.\n\n\nIf you spend eight hours in a row indoors, then you will be drained of your energy much more quickly than if you took breaks and spent some time outside.",
                "Take a twenty-minute walk. Walking for just twenty minutes can wake up your mind and body and make you feel more energized. Whenever you feel your energy waning, step outside, get some fresh air, and move your body.[7]",
                "Get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep is crucial if you want to energize yourself. You may be feeling tired simply because you haven’t been sleeping enough. You may think that enough willpower and caffeine can combat the fact that you’ve been averaging five hours of sleep a night, but nothing can substitute a good night’s sleep. Make sure to sleep for at least 7-8 hours a night and to go to bed around the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning; changing your sleeping schedule regularly can make you feel like you’re waking up with jet lag.\n\n\nMake sure you have a good winding-down routine at least an hour before sleep. Turn off all visual stimuli, such as your phone, computer, and television, and read quietly in bed or listen to some calming music. This can help you fall asleep faster.\nWhen you wake up, stop hitting snooze and start your day. Hitting snooze repeatedly will only make you fall back into a short, jagged sleep, and won’t actually make you feel any more rested. Waking up after you hear your alarm will make you feel more energized and more in control of your day.[8]",
                "Listen to some pump-up music. Turning on music can make you feel more energized instantly. If you’re feeling a little low on the energy scale, just put on your favorite pump up jam, whether you’re listening to Macklemore or Jackson 5. Get a friend to join a quick dance party with you or dance by yourself in a room. Just getting yourself moving will make you feel more energized, awake, and excited to be alive.\n\n\nAlternately, you can also try listening to classical music, even if that’s not your thing. It has been proven to wake up your mind.",
                "Switch between tasks. Another way to energize your mind is to switch to doing something new. Let’s say you’ve been studying for your chemistry test for three hours and you feel yourself flagging. Well, try something new. Start planning that English essay instead, or write that Spanish paragraph you’ve been dreading. Switching gears to something new when the first thing isn’t working is a great way to make yourself feel energized.\n\n\nEven if the task you’ve switched to isn’t necessarily more exciting than the last, just the effort of switching will make you feel a bit more energized.\nStart your day off with a to-do list. That way, the options of tasks you can switch to will be more readily available and you’re less likely to get stuck doing something that is draining your energy.",
                "Reward yourself for your achievements. Setting up rewards for yourself is a great way to feel energized and motivated to continue on with your work or whatever else you have to do. Tell yourself that you’ll eat an ice cream sundae after you study for four hours. Say that you’ll finally go see the second Hunger Games with your friends after you finish all of your chores. Just the thought of something fun on the horizon can make you feel more energized and motivated to continue on with your day.\n\n\nYou can even reward yourself without leaving your desk. Tell yourself that after half an hour of work, you’ll spend five minutes reading that article your best friend sent you.",
                "Avoid multi-tasking. You may think that multi-tasking will keep you alert and can make you get everything done faster, but studies show that multi-tasking can actually drain you of energy faster, make you more distracted, and also make you less efficient than if you were focused on just one task at a time. Checking off items from your to-do list is much more effective – and much more likely to save energy – than trying to complete three tasks at once without fully getting them accomplished.",
                "Try the “ten more minutes” trick. Whenever you’re really flagging in the middle of a task, tell yourself, “I’ll just do this for ten more minutes.” Repeat this to yourself like a mantra as you continue to tackle the task. Setting a short time limit can make your task feel more manageable and less overwhelming and can keep you focused instead of making you lose patience.\n\n\nIf this trick works for you, then you can set longer time limits for yourself – half an hour or even an hour – if you want to muster the energy to master a particular task.",
                "Schedule your day around your energy peaks. This is another great trick for energizing yourself throughout the day. Though most people don’t have the luxury of scheduling their entire day around the peaks and valleys of their energy levels, small changes can make a big difference. If you know you have the most energy in the mornings, schedule your run for the mornings instead of struggling to run after a long day of work; if you know you get a little tired after lunch, then schedule some mindless tasks for that time, from running errands to doing the easiest part of your job.\n\n\nMake a list of your typical schedule and try to chart your energy levels around it. What parts of your schedule can you change to make your life a little easier?\nYou may not be so aware of the ebbs and flows and of your energy levels. Try monitoring yourself on a typical day and keep track of how you feel.",
                "Take a vacation. Though you obviously can’t take a vacation every time you feel the need to really energize yourself, you’ll be surprised by how significantly a much-needed vacation can help spike up your energy levels when you return to your daily life. Whether you go to Bermuda or take a stay-cation to clean up your home and catch up on reading, just taking some time off from your usual tasks, spoiling yourself, and switching up your routine can help you feel more happy and energetic about facing the day.\n\n\nIf you can’t afford a vacation, even a day or two off from work can make you feel less overwhelmed and more alert.",
                "Take breaks every 60-90 minutes. Even the most focused, enthusiastic person needs to take a break every hour or hour and a half. Taking breaks, whether you’re taking a 15 minute walk, stepping outside to call home, or just switching gears and reading a few news stories, will make you feel reinvigorated and ready to tackle the tasks in front of you. Resting your mind a bit can give you more energy and will keep you from feeling burned out. Don’t skip that lunch break to get your work done faster; go out to lunch and return to your work with more energy.\n\n\nTaking breaks can also be great for your eyes. Turn away from that computer and turn to a newspaper, look out a window, or even rake your Zen garden. Your eyes will get weary if you stare at a computer for eight hours straight without a break.",
                "Get social. If you feel your mind starting to drift off and start gearing up for a nap, then it may be time to hang out with your friends. When you’re feeling tired and sleepy, the last thing you may want to do is hang out with a bunch of people, but that’s precisely the thing that will make you more energized. Talking to a close friend or hanging out in a big group can make you feel more energized because you’ll be talking to other people and engaging in a fun, active conversation instead of just sitting there getting tired.\n\n\nSo, the next time you need more energy, call up a friend and make plans to hang out. You’ll feel energetic again in no time."

        "wikiHow to Deal With Moving": {
            "intro": "Moving is often listed among the most stressful human experiences. You have to pack up an entire house, say goodbye to your friends, and start all over somewhere new. You may not be able to cut all the stress from your move, but you can find ways to make it easier. Give yourself plenty of time to make the transition, and take joy in setting up your new home.",
            "steps": [
                "Research your new hometown. Before you start packing your belongings take some time to get to know your new hometown. Look up the town online and see what they have to offer.[1]\n\nMake a list of your hobbies and see if your new hometown has a place for them. If you're into comic books, look for a comic book store. If you're into skateboarding, see if your new town has a skate park.[2]\n\nLook for things that set the town apart from other places. You may find some interesting facts about your new hometown. Share these things with your friends. Involve your friends in your moving experience to help ease the anxiety of moving.[3]",
                "Visit your new school. Ask your parents to let you visit your new school before you move. When you visit, ask about any clubs you might want to join. Try to get to know a little bit about what activities the school offers.[4]\n\nIf you are moving in the middle of the school year, some of the clubs might be full, or deadlines may have passed for certain activities. Talk with the administration and see if they can find ways to get you involved.[5]",
                "Get involved with the moving process. Ask your parents to make you a part of any pre-move visits. If they're going to look for a house, ask to go along. Seeing your new home may help you cope with the stress of moving.[6]\n\nWhile you're visiting, take a look at your new neighborhood. Try to familiarize yourself with the town. Try to find a city map and highlight where you'll be living. Highlight where your new school will be, and any places you might want to visit.[7]",
                "Throw a going away party. Before you leave your new place, invite all your friends over and have one last get together. Share memories with your friends before you leave.[8]",
                "Take pictures of your house before you pack it away. A few weeks before you start packing, take some pictures to remind you of what it was like living there.[9]\n\nTake pictures of your family doing everyday things. Try to capture the experiences you had living in the house.",
                "Talk to your friends and family. If you're feeling nervous about moving, open up to your friends and family. Let them know what's on your mind, and ask them for support.[10]\n\nMake plans to visit your friends and family after the move. While you won't be able to see them as much as you used to, that doesn't mean you have to lose touch with them completely.[11]\n\nMake sure you give yourself plenty of time to say goodbye. Spend quality time with your friends and family. Visit your favorite hangouts and take walks through your neighborhood.[12]",
                "Take care of yourself. Moving is stressful and time consuming, but don't let it get in the way of your health. In times of stress, it is especially important to eat well and get enough rest.[13]\n\nSet aside time to make healthy dinners. Invite friends over to help ease your stress.\nYour mental health is important as well. Don't focus on the negative aspects of moving. Think of the new experiences you'll have, and the new people you will meet. A positive outlook will help you get through the difficulties of moving.[14]",
                "Accept the move. You may be going through a lot of different emotions during the move. Rather than fight the move, accept it, and learn from the experience.[15]\n\nYou will experience change for the rest of your life. Don't let it get the best of you. Open yourself up to new experiences and try to stay positive. You have the opportunity for a fresh start. Join a new club at school, or try-out for one of the sports teams.[16]",
                "Stay close with your family. Don't push your family away because of stress. You may think your parents are trying to ruin your life by moving, but they are not. Your family moved as a whole, and you need to rely on each other.[17]\n\nTalk to your parents about any fears you might have. Reach out to them and use this time to build stronger family bonds.[18]",
                "Get your room set up. Getting your bedroom in order will help you settle down in your new home, and make you feel more at ease.[19]\n\nAfter you get your bedroom set up, start unpacking things that you know you'll need in the next few days. Help your parents with any moving related chores. Try to involve yourself in the moving process as much as you can.[20]",
                "Establish a routine. Start getting familiar with your new home as soon as possible. Take walks around the neighborhood and introduce yourself to your neighbors.[21]\n\nExplore your new city. Seek out things to do to help you get comfortable in your new city. Try new restaurants or go to the park. See what your new town has to offer and go experience it.[22]",
                "Start planning as soon as possible. If you can afford to have some overlap between leases, you can take your time moving from one place to the next. It will cost you more money, but it may be worth it.[23]\n\nTry to give yourself at least a week of overlap. You may be able to talk to you landlord about paying a prorated rent rather than the full month.[24]\n\nYou may not have the option to have any overlap, but you can still start the moving process early. Start packing nonessential items as soon as possible.[25]\n\nMake sure you have a strategy for packing. Set a schedule for yourself and check your progress. Don't let your move-out date sneak up on you.",
                "Get rid of things you don't need. Before you start throwing everything you own into boxes, take some time to sort your stuff. If you haven't used something in a long time, toss it.\n\n\nDonate the things you can't sell to a thrift store. You could also see if your friends need anything, and give some things to them.[26]",
                "Organize your boxes. As you pack up a room, remember to label the boxes. Write the contents of the box and what room it belongs in to make things easier. Remember to label breakable items as fragile.[27]\n\nGo to a grocery store and see if you can take some boxes from the back. If you can't find any free boxes, you can always buy some from moving supply stores.",
                "Pack a suitcase. When packing bedrooms, keep a suitcase on hand to store essential items. Pack toiletries and spare clothes as if you were taking a trip.[28]",
                "Hire movers. If you don't have the time, or the desire, to move yourself, hire some help. Ask friends and coworkers for recommendations.[29]\n\nMake sure the movers take a thorough inventory of what you plan to move. The bulk and weight of what you move will impact the cost of moving. Getting an accurate estimate will help you budget the rest of your move.[30]\n\nCheck with the American Moving and Storage Association for a list of reliable movers.[31]\n\nIf you can't afford to hire movers, see if you can get a few friends to help you with the move. Offer to buy them dinner afterwards to return the favor."

        "wikiHow to Write a Letter of Interest for a House": {
            "intro": "A letter of interest for a house is a personal letter a prospective buyer writes to a seller. When a potential buyer writes a letter of interest, he or she hopes to form a connection with the seller of the house, communicate the love of the home, and stand out from the often numerous other potential buyers. Additionally, a potential buyer may also write a \"letter of intent\" (LOI), a more formal (but non-binding) letter that indicates the seriousness of their intentions to purchase a house. Such letters can mark the beginning of, or accompany, negotiations between buyer and seller.[1] Both can be important tools when attempting to purchase a house, especially when both parties have decided to forego a realtor.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn when a letter of interest can benefit you. You can use a letter of interest to set yourself apart as a potential buyer for a particular property. In essence, the letter gives you the chance to describe yourself, your family, your situation, and any other aspects you’d like to make a lasting impression on the home’s seller.\n\n\nYou can maximize the effectiveness of a letter of interest in particular situations. For example, in a “seller’s market” situation, you can face competition from a crowded market of buyers all seeking the same house. A letter of interest is a tool you can use to make you stick out from the crowd.\nLetters of interest are less common when both parties involved are using a realtor. If the seller uses a realtor, he or she may want to minimize any part in the selling process, and the seller’s realtor is more likely concerned with which potential buyer can close on the house quickly and for the largest percentage of the asking price.",
                "Form a connection. Learn what you can about the current owners of the house and highlight similarities with your own life in your letter. If both you and the seller work as teachers, you can write something like, \"What would be better than to have a teacher taking care of your old house?\"[2]\n\nIf you (or your partner, spouse, or children) attended the same school, work in the same sector, volunteer for the same charity, or share any other significant connections to the owners, be sure to make note of this in your letter.[3]\nDon't sound too formal: I am a 30 year old alumnus of University Xyz with a degree in chemistry.Do sound approachable: The U Xyz banner at open house brought back memories — I didn't expect to meet another alumnus out here!",
                "Tell the buyer why you love the home. Clearly express why you love this specific home and neighborhood. Write something along the lines of, \"My family and I love the beautiful backyard and look forward to many afternoons relaxing beside the pool.\"[4]\n\nFocus on specific features of the home and neighborhood that you love, such as the sunroom, yard, surrounding walking trails, etc.[5]\n\nPeople are often still attached the houses they’re selling. Use this section to show the seller that you have the proper appreciation for the house. Show the seller that selling to you would leave the house in good hands.",
                "Write emotionally but authentically. An emotional connection between buyer and seller can be crucial to purchasing a home, so don't be afraid to use emotional language. However, honesty and authenticity always go a long way, so avoid coming across as saccharine or desperate. [6][7]\nDon't mention sad stories: ...turned down from several houses . . . looking to escape an awful neighborhood...Do tug on heartstrings in an upbeat way: ...kids loved running down the beach . . . couldn't stop smiling when I looked at the view...\n\n\n\nThis also means you shouldn’t exaggerate what you love about the house. The current owner will know the house better than anyone, including the work it needs. Overselling how perfect the house is can easily home across as inauthentic. Don’t be afraid to mention that you’d repaint, finish the basement, etc. This also tells the seller that you’re willing to invest in the upkeep of the house.",
                "Paint a positive picture of yourself. Focus on your strengths, financial stability, and other positive characteristics that would make you the perfect homeowner. Highlight why you would make a great owner.\n\nDon't brag: ...outstanding work ethic . . . pillar of the community...Do mention positive traits: I am community-minded and volunteer at my local school.[8][9][10]",
                "Save the best for last. Reiterate your excitement to purchase the house, as well as your most salient qualities. The closing paragraph of a letter of interest can be the most crucial, and thus it is important to close on a positive note.\n\n\nA closing paragraph might also imagine the future you and your family will enjoy in the home. You might write, \"I would be so excited to raise my family here, and would enjoy many years creating memories in this home.\"\nExpress your sincere appreciation for the owner's time. Include a warm thank you at the end of the letter, such as, \"Your consideration is greatly appreciated,\" or similar wording. [11][12]",
                "Keep the letter short. Outline a few important reasons why you would love to (and should) live in the house, but definitely keep it under a page.\n\n\nTry to avoid including too much detail about your own life story, and avoid complaining about the difficulties you might be experiencing in finding a home.[13][14]",
                "Learn how a letter of intent (LOI) can benefit you. A letter of intent is completely different from a letter of interest. However, the two are sometimes confused. While letters of interest attempt to set you apart from other buyers in the market, you can think of a letter of intent more like a pre-contract on the house. It sets a basis for the details of the transaction around the house and acts as a starting point for negotiations. This allows the buyer and seller to make sets of offers and counteroffers before committing to a final contract.[15]\n\nOne of the most important aspects of an LOI is that it isn’t binding, meaning either party can walk away at any point in the process.[16]\n\nLike letters of interests, letters of intent aren’t common when realtors are involved in the process. Realtors usually hash out the details on behalf of their clients with the implicit knowledge that nothing is binding until a final contract is agreed to and signed.",
                "Differentiate an LOI from a contingent offer. You should also be aware of contingent offers and how they differ from LOIs. A contingent offers constitutes a very real offer on the house, but one for which contingencies must be met by the seller.[17] If the seller accepts the contingent offer, he or she will have the specified amount of time to complete the work, inspection, or other contingent action before finalizing the house’s sale.[18]\n\nYou can include contingent items in your letter of intent, but the scope of an LOI is larger and less official than an actual contingent offer. You shouldn’t make any offer on the home—contingent or otherwise—until both parties have agreed upon all of the specifics of an LOI.",
                "Address your letter to the seller. Use the seller’s full personal or company name, main address, and contact information, and date the letter.",
                "Indicate that you are interested in buying the house. Include the property address and any details about what will be included in the purchase, including furnishings, land, or other items.\n\n\nFormal language is most common. You can write, \"This letter describes the intent of (your name) to purchase the real estate located at (location) owned by (seller's name).\" [19] Ensure that the name and address of each party, as well as that of the property, are included.[20]\n\nYou may choose to begin this sentence in a semi-formal manner, such as, \"I, (your name name), am writing this letter to declare my interest to buy..\"",
                "List the price you would be willing to offer in the second sentence. Use a phrase such as \"The proposed purchase price is...,\" or, \"The purchase price proposed is,\" or similar wording.[21][22] Remember that as a basis for negotiation, the seller can choose to counter at a higher percentage of the full asking price than what you offer here.[23]\n\nThe offer should also indicate that the purchase price will be paid to the seller at the closing of the deal, when a binding Purchase Agreement is signed.[24][25]\n\nIf you are proposing to rent or lease, indicate whether you are proposing a weekly, monthly, yearly, or multi-year rent, and in what installments the rent will be made (e.g., every month, every year, etc.). Also include any pro-rated portions of rent if the home is to be inhabited in the middle of a month.",
                "Propose a deposit if applicable. To show that you’re serious about the intent to purchase the house (contingent upon good faith negotiations), you can choose to offer a deposit in your LOI. Rather than actually exchanging hands, this deposit is typically held in escrow for the duration of negotiations. Ensure that you clearly spell out the term under which the deposit will be returned to you, such as by a certain date or if no agreement on the house can be reached.\n\n\nThis amount may be approximately one to three percent of the purchase price. When a final agreement is signed, the money typically goes toward the down payment.[26][27]",
                "Outline the finance period. Indicate the expected period of time you will require to secure the necessary funds. While you do not have to include any specific banking information, you should include the soonest you can expect to secure financing, as well as the soonest date you might be willing to close on the sale.\n\n\nYou can include other dates in this section, such as a date on which the negotiations automatically void. This can help push a buyer into making a decision more quickly if you place an expiration date in the LOI.\nIf you are represented by a broker, you can also clarify how the broker's fees will be paid.[28][29][30]",
                "Suggest a “due diligence” period. If you would like to take additional time to inspect the home, review property tax records, examine building permits, or anything else, you can also suggest a period for you to perform your due diligence on the house.[31][32] Use this period to discover anything about the house on which your eventual offer might be contingent.\n\n\nBe specific about the nature of your inspection: an independent tour, for example, or investigation of tax or other records.\nYou may also specify what types of information or disclosures you will require during an inspection.[33]",
                "Close with a paragraph indicating that the letter of interest is not legally binding. Make sure this clause is carefully worded and explicitly clarifies that neither party is legally bound to the letter of intent.[34][35]\n\nMake sure there is a clause that states explicitly that \"this letter does not bind the buyer or seller to any offer, financial or otherwise,\" or use similar wording that clearly communicates that neither the buyer nor seller is legally bound to the letter of intent and may walk away at any time.[36]\n\nA seller who is both a novice to the selling process and working without a realtor can interpret such as clause as a lack of seriousness about the property, but you don’t want to risk leaving the letter of intent otherwise worded in such a way that a court could find a legal, enforceable document.",
                "Sign and date the letter. Use a formal sign-off, such as \"Sincerely,\" or similar wording. The letter should also include phrasing such as \"Agreed to and Accepted by,\" or similar wording, followed by the signatures of both the buyer and seller.[37]"

        "How to Care for Pygmy Goats": {
            "intro": "True or false: Pasture-fed goats don’t need supplemental vitamins or minerals. ",
            "steps": [
                "Determine how much shelter you need. To make this determination, consider the weather in your area. If you live in a mostly temperate climate, your goats may not need as substantial a shelter as other places. However, if you're in an area that has severe winters, you'll need a full-on barn to protect your animals, though it can be a small one. You just need to provide protection from the elements.[1]",
                "Consider the size of your herd. The size of your shelter is determined by the size of your herd. In general, you need to provide 15 to 20 square feet for each goat you have.[2]\n\nSo if you only have one goat, your shelter should be 15 to 20 square feet. In practice, that's a 3-by-5-foot shelter or a 4-by-5-foot shelter. If you have 5 goats, you'll need 75 square feet to 100 square feet, which translates to approximately an 8-by-9-foot shelter or a 10-by-10-foot shelter.\nIn fact, you can use a large dog house for a pygmy goat if you are keeping it in your backyard.[3]",
                "Create stalls. If you have multiple animals, create multiple stalls so each goat has his or her own space. The ideal floor for goats is gravel with clay on top of it. It's easy to clean out, and you can apply another layer every couple of years.[4]\n\nHay is sufficient for bedding, and goats generally won't eat what's on the floor.[5]\n\nAlso, you'll need troughs of some sort to feed the goats in.[6]",
                "Don't forget a fence. The best fences for pygmy goat is wire fence. To keep your pygmy goats from jumping over, the fence needs to be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) high.[7]",
                "Include climbing areas. Goats love to climb, so you'll need to include some places for them to do so. For instance, any kind of picnic table is ideal for this pastime. You can even just create hills out of dirt, as goats will find that just as enjoyable. They also like to jump on and off these places.[8]\n\nOld tires also make good toys for your pets.",
                "Buy at least two goats. Goats are meant to be in a herd, so you should keep more than one. They prefer to live in a social group.[9]",
                "Allow your goat to graze. Goats can eat grass, brush, and forbs, though they will eat the last two over grasses. Forbs are weeds such as dandelions and clovers. In the summer, goats may be able to subsist solely on pasture if you have enough land.[10] You will need about 1/4 of an acre of land per goat.[11]\n\nIf you have a herd of goats, you will need several pastures to keep up with your goats' demand. Also, you want rotate where your goats feed so that plants have time to grow back.[12]",
                "Try alfalfa hay. If you don't have a sufficient pasture for your goat or goats, you can feed alfalfa hay in place of grazing.[13]\n\nEach goat will need about a pound or two of feed per day. However, if they are also getting grains, they will need less.[14]",
                "Supplement their diet with grains. In the winter, goats will need more feed. Also, goats that are providing a substantial amount of milk and young goats will need a supplemental diet of grains even in summer.[15]\n\nAppropriate grains include corn, barley, and oats.[16]",
                "Provide a plentiful supply of water. Like all animals, goats need water to live. [17] However, water is especially important to goats, as they are ruminants, meaning it takes more water for them to process their food than other animals.[18] Always ensure they have access to clean, fresh water on a regular basis.\n\n\nMake sure to clean out the container you use fairly regularly and to change the water often.[19]",
                "Brush your goat once a day. Use a a sturdier brush to get rid of the more obvious dirt on your goat. Next, use a soft brush (curry comb) to comb through your goat's hair. Also, feel for bumps on your goat as you brush, as those could indicate infections or a cut or scratch.[20]\n\nYour goat will not likely need clipping unless you plan to show her.[21]",
                "Bathe your goats only if they get parasites. Most of the time, brushing will be sufficient for your goat. To bathe the goat, slightly warm up the water so it's not cold. Lather the goat up with a shampoo meant for animals or goats. Use a washing mitt to help along the process. Rinse off the soap.[22]\n\nIt makes it easier if your goat has a collar on because it is easier for you to hold on to her.[23]",
                "Provide vitamin A. Pygmy goats need vitamin A in their diets to keep up their health. Mostly, they can get this vitamin from green hay or from grazing. However, if you are not supplying either of these, try adding some corn to their diet.[24]",
                "Include vitamin D. Just like in humans, vitamin D helps goats absorb calcium, which maintains bone health. If your goats are outside most of the time, they will absorb vitamin D from the sun. However, if they don't get much sunlight, feed them either sun-cured hay (not heat-cured) or irradiated yeast.[25]",
                "Add minerals for pasture-fed goats. If your goats are exclusively pasture-fed (rather than alfalfa- and grain-fed), you should add a mix of iodized salt, limestone (ground), and animal bones (steamed and ground).[26]\n\nEssentially, you can put this mixture out in its own bucket and let the goats eat it as needed.[27]",
                "Inject selenium. Selenium is an essential nutrient, but it is especially important if white muscle disease is prevalent in your area, as selenium protects against this disease. When kids are born, you should provide a supplement of this nutrient by needle.[28]\n\nThis disease calcifies the muscles, making them whitish, which is where the disease gets its name.[29]",
                "Give vaccinations yearly.[30] Your goat will need to be vaccinated against enterotoxemia and tetanus, at the very least. You can usually buy these at local feed stores and give them yourself. You may also want to ask your vet about rabies shots.[31]\n\nYou may also want a clostridium CD vaccination.[32]",
                "Schedule a yearly checkup. To keep your goat in good health, it's best to schedule a yearly checkup. That way, you can ensure your goat has the proper vaccinations, and you know your goat is in good health.[33]",
                "Trim your goats' hooves. Your goats hooves will grow over time, and if they aren't trimmed, you could end up with goats who can't walk well.[34]\n\nTo trim them, use gloves, hoof shears, and a hoof knife.[35]\n\nTie or hold the goat. You will need to have someone hold the goat in place while you trim its hooves.[36]\n\nLook for the growth rings. You should be able to see where the hooves have grown. Trim back the hooves until they are even with the last growth ring.[37]"

Use a method that requires less water to get the dishes clean.\nTurn off washing machine's water supply to prevent leaks. It doesn't need to be on all the time.\nReplace old toilets with new ones that use a lot less water.\nWash and dry only full loads of laundry and dishes. Doing a half-load wastes water.\nDon't use too much water to water your lawn.\nDon't leave the faucet running while you brush your teeth.",
                "Use fewer chemicals. Chemicals used to wash our bodies, homes, cars and everything else get washed down the drain or absorbed in the grass, and eventually, end up in the water supply. Since most people use heavy-duty chemicals for all sorts of things, chemicals are doing real damage to waterways and aquatic life. The chemicals aren't good for humans, either, so do your best to cut back on them. Here's how:\n\n\nLearn about alternatives household cleaning items that do not use hazardous chemicals. For example, using a solution of 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 water works as well as most commercial cleaners for basic cleaning jobs. Baking soda and salt are cheap, non-toxic cleansers, but should be used in moderation.\nWhen no good alternatives to a toxic item exist, determine the least amount required for an effective, sanitary result and use a minimal amount each time you clean. Paying close attention to the requisite amount will help you reduce and also save money.\nInstead of using chemical-laden shampoos and soaps, try making your own.\nInstead of using pesticides and herbicides, find natural ways to get rid of weeds and pests.",
                "Dispose of toxic waste the right way. Paint, motor oil, ammonia, and a host of other chemicals should not be poured down the drain or directly into the ecosystem. They'll soak into the earth and end up in the groundwater. Contact your local sanitation department to find out about best practice for disposing of hazardous waste and toxic chemicals. [1]",
                "Help identify large-scale water polluters. Individuals can only do so much when it comes to keeping water clean. Businesses and industries are often the culprits when it comes to water pollution. In order to protect the earth's water, concerned citizens should speak up and find ways to stop pollution at its source. [2]\n\nJoin a local environmental group that works to clean up the water in your area, whether it's a river, lake or ocean.\nContact your local representative to speak up about your views on keeping water chemical-free.\nVolunteer to help clean up beaches or riverbanks.\nHelp others get involved in efforts to clean up the water in your area.",
                "Use less electricity. Coal and natural gas are the most common sources of energy that gets turned into electricity. The burning of these substances is a major factor in world air pollution. Reducing your reliance on electricity is a great way to play a part in saving the planet.[3] Here's what you can do:\n\n\nUse solar power for home and water heating.\nShut off electrical equipment in the evening when you leave work.\nIf you have central air conditioning, do not close vents in unused rooms.\nLower the thermostat on your water heater to 120.\nTurn down or shut off your water heater when you will be away for extended periods.\nTurn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time.\nSet your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38 and your freezer at 0 to 5 .\nWhen using an oven, minimize door opening while it is in use; it reduces oven temperature by 25 to 30 every time you open the door.\nClean the lint filter in your dryer after every load so that it uses less energy.\nWash clothes with warm or cold water instead of hot.\nTurn off lights, computers and other appliances when not in use.\nUse compact fluorescent light bulbs to save money and energy.\nPlant trees to shade your home.\nReplace old windows with energy efficient ones.\nKeep your thermostat higher in summer and lower in winter when you are away.\nInsulate your home as best as you can.",
                "Drive and fly less often. Another big source of air pollution that has led to global warming is emissions from cars, trucks, planes and other vehicles. The manufacture of the vehicles, the gas needed to run them, the chemicals they burn, and the production of roads all play a part. If you can drive and fly less often, you'll be doing a lot to help save the planet.[4]\n\nWalk or ride your bike instead of driving, whenever possible. Find bike routes in your town and use them!\nJoin a carpool or vanpool to get to work if biking or walking isn't an option.\nReport smoking vehicles to your local air agency.\nMaintain your vehicle properly. Purchase radial tires and keep them properly inflated for your vehicle. Paint with brushes or rollers instead of using spray paints to minimize harmful emissions.",
                "Buy local goods. Buying local helps combat air pollution in two ways. You don't have to travel as far to get what you need, and products don't have to travel as far to get to you, either. Making smart choices about where your food, clothes, and other goods come from can help make a dent in air pollution.\n\n\nShop at farmer's markets and buy food that was produced as close to your home as possible.\nWhen you're online shopping, pay attention to how far the items you order will travel before they arrive. Try to find items that won't have to travel long distances.\nPay attention to where your clothes, electronics, home goods, and other possessions were made. As much as possible, buy items that were made in your region.",
                "Eat vegetables and locally-sourced meat. Industrial farming practices are not only harmful to individual animals, they're unsafe for the planet itself. Factory farming produces a lot of air and water pollution. You can address this issue in a personal way by doing the following:\n\n\nEat more vegetables. This simple change is a way of opting out of the factory farming industry.\nQuestion where your meat comes from.\nBuy only locally-sourced meat from a small farm.\nAvoid eating beef. Cows emit lots of methane, a dangerous green house gas, and other pollutants. Try to reduce your beef intake and opt for other types of meat.",
                "Become an air pollution activist. Identify local groups working to combat air pollution, and find a way to get involved. By educating yourself and others about the problem, you can have a greater impact than you'd have by simply making lifestyle changes.\n\n\nJoin a group that plants trees to help clean the air.\nBecome a bike activist. Work to have safe paths built in your city.\nContact your local representatives to speak up about issues particular to your region. If there's a factory spewing pollutants into the air, for example, get politically active to put a stop to it.",
                "Produce less waste. Everything you throw in the garbage, tie up and take out to be collected is going to end up in a landfill. Plus, all that trash - plastic, paper, metal, and whatnot - was likely manufactured using unsustainable practices that hurt the health of the earth's land. By making less trash, you can reduce your impact. Try making these changes:\n\n\nBuy products that you can reuse. Get glass containers instead of flimsy plastic ones, for example.\nDon't use plastic bags - use cloth.\nMaintain and repair durable products instead of buying new ones.\nAvoid products with several layers of packaging when only one is sufficient. About 33% of what we throw away is packaging.\nUse reusable plates and utensils instead of disposable ones. Use reusable containers to store food instead of aluminum foil and cling wrap.\nBuy rechargeable batteries for devices used frequently.\nCopy and print on both sides of paper.\nReuse items like envelopes, folders and paper clips.\nUse e-mail or texting as a substitute for paper correspondence.\nUse recycled paper.\nMend clothes instead of buying new ones.\nBuy used furniture - there is a surplus of it, and it is much cheaper than new furniture.",
                "Make your own stuff. When you make your own dinner from scratch or mix up your own cleaning supplies, you naturally make less waste. Single-sized TV dinners, shampoo bottles and the like can really add up in the trash can! Here are a few things you can make on your own:\n\n\nFood. If you're really ambitions, grow your own! Otherwise, do your best to make as many meals as possible from scratch. Buy ingredients in bulk to cut back on packaging.\nBody products. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste etc. - you name it, you can make it! Try replacing a few things at first, then work up to making most of what you use. Hint: coconut oil is a brilliant replacement for lotion, deep conditioner and face wash.\nCleaning products. Everything from window cleaner to bathroom cleaner to oven cleaner can be made using all-natural supplies.",
                "Compost. This is an excellent way to cut back on waste and improve the health of the land you're living on at the same time. Instead of throwing your food scraps in the trash, compost them in a bin or a pile. After tending the pile for a few weeks, you'll have rich soil you can spread on your grass or use to make a delicious vegetable garden. The land around you will be healthier and more vibrant for your efforts.",
                "Plant trees and don't cut them. Trees protect land from getting eroded, and they're an integral part of the ecosystem. In saving trees you'll be protecting not only land, but water and air, too. If you have room in your yard, consider planting a few trees to invest in the future of your neighborhood.\n\n\nDo research to figure out what trees will be most beneficial to the environment where you live. Plant native species.\nAim to plant trees that will grow tall and provide shade.[5]",
                "Work to stop clearcutting and mining. These practices raze and gut the land so that it's no longer healthy enough to provide a home for plants and wildlife. Join up with a group working to protect your region from industrial practices that damage the land.[6]",
                "Make your property a haven for wildlife. All types of animals, from birds to deer to insects, have lost some of their habitat to human developments. You've probably seen birds bathing in oil-tainted water and deer wandering through suburbs because they have nowhere else to go. If you have the space, try to be welcoming to animals who could use a helping hand. You can make your property hospitable in the following ways:\n\n\nPlant shrubs, flowers and trees that attract wildlife.\nPut out a bird feeder and bird bath stocked with clean food and water.\nLet beneficial snakes, spiders, bees, bats, and other creatures live. Having these animals around is a sign your ecosystem is in good health.\nInstall a beehive if you have the room.\nUse cedar chips or aromatic herbs instead of mothballs.\nDon't use chemical pesticides.\nUse humane traps instead of rat and mouse poisons and insect killers.\nUse an electric or manual lawnmower instead of a gas-powered one.",
                "Eat sustainably-caught fish. The oceans are being depleted of large fish populations due to overfishing and pollution. Up to 90 percent of the ocean's large fish are now gone.[7] You can do your part to protect marine life by only eating fish that is in season and caught using sustainable practices.",
                "Respect animals. Many animals that are thought of as pests are not causing real harm. Other animals that live in wild places aren't usually in human view, so we tend to forget about their needs. With dozens of animal species going extinct every day,[8] they need all they help they can get. Try being more mindful in the following ways:\n\n\nLet creatures like moles, groundhogs, and squirrels live instead of trapping and killing them. They may cause a little inconvenience in your garden, but they have a part to play in your region's ecosystem.\nDon't disturb wild places like forests, beaches, wetlands and other areas where animals make their homes. When you visit such areas, stay on trails so you don't accidentally cause damage to an animal's habitat.",
                "Work to protect animal habitats.[9] Whether there's a particular type of animal you want to work to save, or you'd like to work for the health of all of the planet's endangered species, there's an animal rights group out there that could use your energy and time.",

        "wikiHow to Boost Energy Levels": {
            "intro": "Fatigue and low energy levels are two of the most common problems faced by people of all ages.[1] Low energy levels can make it difficult to be productive at work or to engage in everyday activities. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to increase your energy levels. Eating the right types of food, exercising properly, getting enough rest, and controlling your stressors can help give you more energy to enjoy your day and get back to doing the things you love.",
            "steps": [
                "Give your body more protein. Even if you're eating enough food every day, it's possible you're not eating the right kinds of food. Dietary deficiencies are one of the most common causes of low energy levels, and protein in particular plays a big part in your daily energy levels.[2]\n\nProtein is essential for increased energy levels.[3] But not all protein is good protein. Some meats, for example, are high in protein but also come with high sodium or saturated fat levels.[4]\n\nMedical professionals recommend that adults consume at least eight grams of protein for every 20 pounds of body weight (or 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight) every day.[5]\n\nOptimal sources of heart-healthy protein include salmon,[6] eggs,[7] and legumes like beans, lentils, and tofu.[8]",
                "Choose slow-burning starches. Starches and carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet. They provide us with energy to complete all manner of activities, from running to breathing.[9] But there are good carbs and bad carbs, and if you're feeling fatigued it's important to choose healthy carbohydrates that will help fuel your body throughout the day.[10]\n\nEat four to eleven servings of grains each day, and opt for whole grain foods instead of processed or refined grains.[11]\n\nWhole grain or wholemeal sources of starch and carbohydrates release energy gradually throughout the day, helping you feel more energetic. Choose whole grain, complex carbohydrates rather than simple carbs, which can cause an energy crash shortly after eating.[12]\n\nSome sources of energy-boosting, complex carbohydrates include vegetables, legumes, and whole grains like bran and germ.[13]\n\nChoose breads and pastas made from whole grain whenever possible.[14]",
                "Select good sources of fats. Fats act as a source of energy as your body begins to run low on carbohydrates. Your body needs some dietary sources of fat, but it's important to choose the right kinds of fat.\n\n\nThe four basic forms of fats are monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids. Of these, saturated fats and trans fats are the worst fats.[15]\n\nChoose a diet high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids for more energy and a healthier heart.[16]\n\nSome heart-healthy sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats include seafood, nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, grape seed oil, and flaxseed oil.[17]\n\nNuts that provide healthy fatty acids include macadamias, hazelnuts, pecans, almonds, cashews, peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts.[18]",
                "Eat more raw fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables provide you with vitamins and minerals that your body needs to feel full and energetic throughout the day.[19]\n\nEat at least five servings of vegetables each day and two to four servings of fresh fruit.[20]\n\nAim for fruits and vegetables that are low on the glycemic index (GI). High-GI foods cause a spike in blood sugar levels, which typically causes a subsequent energy crash. Low-GI foods enter the blood more slowly and can help avoid energy crashes.[21]\n\nExamples of low-GI foods include non-tropical fruits, sweet potato, corn, yam, beans/legumes, and non-starchy vegetables like carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, broccoli, and squash.[22]\n\nSelect vegetables for daily consumption that are leafy and dark green. Green and leafy vegetables are packed with vitamins and nutrients.[23]",
                "Drink plenty of water. Inadequate water consumption can lead to dehydration, which causes fatigue and feelings of low-energy.[24] Help fight fatigue by staying hydrated throughout the day.\n\n\nExperts recommend drinking nine to twelve glasses of water each day to stay properly hydrated.[25] That total includes water you consume through juice, coffee, tea, and dietary sources of water like fruits and vegetables.[26]\n\nIf you're engaging in strenuous physical activity, or if you are in a hot environment, you will need to drink even more water to stay properly hydrated.[27]\n\nAvoid sugary sodas and beverages.[28]\n\nAvoid drinking too much caffeine. Caffeine is a diuretic, which can cause you to lose a considerable amount of water.[29]",
                "Avoid sugar. Sugar gives consumers a temporary burst of energy (known as a sugar rush), but these effects wear off quickly. Once the sugar rush ends, most people feel tired and sluggish.[30]\n\nDon't eat candy, sweets, soda, or any other food products with added sugar, as these will only make you more tired as the day goes on.[31]",
                "Get more exercise. Physical activity is a known energy booster, and can also help you get a better night's sleep.[32] If you're feeling fatigued and low on energy, a vigorous workout every day or several times each week can help you feel more energetic and get better, more restful sleep.\n\n\nTry to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day or follow the guidelines here.[33]\n\nOpt for cardio workouts like walking, running, and biking.[34]\n\nTalk to your doctor before beginning a workout routine.",
                "Stretch out your body. Whether you're lounging at home or tied to your desk at work, stretching can help give you a noticeable boost in energy.[35]\n\nStretch your arms and hands above your head as high as you can reach, and hold them for 10 to 15 seconds.[36]\n\nWith your arms outstretched to the side, lower your torso to one side so that one set of hands touches the floor and the other set of hands points upward. Hold this for 10 to 15 seconds, then reverse to the other side.\nTouch your toes while your legs are as straight as possible.[37]",
                "Get enough rest. If you're constantly feeling low on energy, you may not be getting enough sleep, or you may be getting poor quality sleep.[38]\n\nTeenagers typically need between eight and 10 hours of sleep each night.[39]\n\nAdults ages 18 to 64 typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night.[40]\n\nOlder adults ages 65 and up typically need between seven to eight hours of sleep each night.[41]\n\nLimit caffeine and stimulants to help ensure a good night's sleep.[42]\n\nTurn off all electronics at least 30 minutes before bed to ensure a better night's sleep.[43]",
                "Reduce your stress levels. Stress has been recognized as a trigger for worsening symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as general problems with sleeping and getting adequate rest.[44]\n\nTake deep breaths from your diaphragm to help lower your heart rate and reduce stress.[45]\n\nTry progressive muscle relaxation to unwind. Slowly tense each major muscle group in your body, focusing on one part of the body at a time. Hold that tense pose for about five seconds, then release the tension and relax for 30 seconds before moving on to the next muscle group.[46]\n\nTake a vacation or work on issues that are adding to your daily stress, such as relationship issues, to help relieve stress.[47]\n\nConsider taking added steps to address your stress and help you to relax such as participating in classes for meditation, mindfulness, or yoga.[48]",
                "Try taking supplements. If you're experiencing consistently low energy levels, your doctor may recommend that you take supplements to help. Always consult your doctor before beginning any supplement regimen.\n\n\nExamples of supplements used to boost energy include 300 mg to 1000 mg of magnesium, sometimes combined with malic acid, and omega 3s and 6s, taken cautiously to avoid interactions with existing meds.[49]\n\nSome doctors recommend taking NADH at a dose of 5 mg to 20 mg per day, DHEA, dosed at 50 mg to 200 mg per day, vitamin B12 by injection, dosed at 2500 mcg to 5000 mcg every two to three days for several weeks, and beta-carotine, 50,000 IU each day to strengthen the immune system.[50]\n\nOther supplements include L-carnitine, 500 mg to 1000 mg three times day for eight weeks, vitamin D at a dose of 600 to 1000 IU each day, and melatonin, 0.5 mg to 3 mg nightly about 8 hours before bedtime.[51]",
                "Use herbal remedies. Some people find that certain herbal treatments help boost energy levels and fight fatigue. However, herbal treatments can cause problems with existing medical conditions and prescribed medications.[52] Do not take any herbal remedies without consulting your doctor.\n\n\nHerbs that may prove helpful with treating chronic fatigue syndrome include ginseng and echinacea. Both have been shown to be possibly helpful in increasing the immune response in people with chronic fatigue syndrome.[53]\n\nEssential oils including jasmine, peppermint, and rosemary oil may possibly be helpful with reducing stress associated with this syndrome. You can use the essential oils as aromatherapy by applying the oil to a cotton ball, by adding a few drops in a warm bath, or by using a unit that disperses aromas within the room.[54]",
                "Recognize underlying medical problems. If you are following a healthy diet, increasing your exercise, and making changes in your daily routine with no improvement, there may be a medical condition or medication that is causing the problem.[55] If you believe you may have a medical condition causing chronic fatigue, it's important to talk to your doctor about how to identify and treat your condition. There are many different types of underlying medical conditions that can cause fatigue, including:\n\n\nAnemia, specifically iron deficiency anemia[56]\n\nDepression, grief, or recent loss[57]\n\nPersistent pain problems[58]\n\nThyroid gland problems[59]\n\nSleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, or narcolepsy[60]\n\nAddison disease[61]\n\nAnorexia nervosa or other eating disorders[62]\n\nArthritis[63]\n\nAutoimmune diseases such as lupus[64]\n\nCongestive heart failure[65]\n\nDiabetes[66]\n\nFibromyalgia[67]\n\nChronic bacterial infections[68]\n\nViral infections such as mononucleosis (mono)[69]\n\nChronic kidney and liver problems[70]",
                "Review your medications with your doctor. Some medications, especially psychiatric medications, can cause feelings of fatigue and exhaustion, but with your doctor's assistance, you may be able to adjust your dosage or replace your current medication with a different prescription. Never alter or adjust your medications on your own, as this can have serious consequences on your health, which may be fatal.[71] Some medications that may cause you to feel overly tired or fatigued include:\n\n\nAntihistamines[72]\n\nAntidepressants[73]\n\nAnxiety drugs[74]\n\nSleeping medications[75]\n\nBlood pressure medications[76]\n\nSteroids[77]\n\nDiuretics[78]",
                "Learn symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. If you feel consistently fatigued and don't seem to find any relief from sleep or dietary/lifestyle changes, you may have chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\nCommon symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome include sudden onset of fatigue, especially after having the flu, low grade fever and chills, sore throat and swollen lymph glands in the neck and armpit area, muscle and joint aches, headaches, problems with concentration, and mood changes.[79]\n\nDepression and added life stressors tend to cause chronic fatigue syndrome to linger and may cause symptoms that are more severe.[80]\n\nThere is no current cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, but psychotherapy and a strong emotional support system have been shown to help people recover from chronic fatigue syndrome.[81]\n\nClasses of medications used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome include antidepressants, both tricyclic and serotonin agents, anxiety medications, pain medications, and stimulants.[82]"

            "intro": "Some people think that elegance is a lost art, but young women can still express a gracious air. Such behavior comes from using good manners and acting like a mature adult. By learning proper etiquette, you will become more generous, polite, and graceful. How you treat others is equally important. An elegant and mature young lady helps and treats others in a non-judgmental way. It is important to speak and stand with proper decorum. Even if you have not had etiquette training in the past, you can still act like a lady by learning some basic rules.",
            "steps": [
                "Say please and thank you. These are the basics of good manners! You might be speaking to a teacher at school or a waiter at a restaurant, but you should always express your appreciation.[1]\n\nSay “please” if you want something.\nSay “thank you” if you are given something.\nSay “no, thank you” if you want to refuse something.\nIf someone gives you a gift, write them a thank you note to express your gratitude.",
                "Learn how to excuse yourself. There are certain situations in which you will need to excuse yourself. You may need to leave the dinner table early, or you may need to take a call in another room. Do not just disappear without saying anything. This is extremely rude. Try saying one of the following.\n\n\nIf you need to leave the dinner table, you may ask, “May I be excused?”\nIf you need to use the restroom, simply say, “Excuse me. I’ll be right back.” You do not need to tell them where you are going.\nIf your phone rings, say, “Excuse me. I need to take this call.” When you return, apologize to the other person, and explain that it was important. Only take the call if it is important. It is rude to be on your phone in social settings.[2]",
                "Practice good manners at the table. The dinner table is not the place to be reading your phone or texts. You should put away all distractions during a meal so that you can speak to the people you’re eating with.\n\n\nEat most of what your host gives you, and at least try everything. If you have an allergy or special diet, try to tell your host as far in advance as possible.\nWait for everyone to get their food before you start eating. If you’re visiting someone, you do not start eating until your host begins. At a restaurant, wait until everyone has been served their food.\nChew slowly and quietly. Do not slurp noodles or soup.\nAsk for food to be passed for you. Do not reach over the table.\nDo not talk with your mouth full. Close your mouth while you eat.[3]",
                "Volunteer to help out when there is a need. Always offer your assistance when you notice that someone might need help. Ask if there is anything you can do, even if you are certain that the other person will say no. Some ways you can help include:\n\n\nOffer to help clean up after dinner.\nBring a dish to parties and events.\nDrop off medicine to a sick friend.\nDrive an elderly family member around on their errands.",
                "Dress appropriately. Maintain good hygiene by showering daily. Make sure that your clothes are clean and ironed. You should understand that different situations require different types of clothing. While jeans and a t-shirt may be fine for hanging out with friends, you should wear something nicer when at a wedding. There are certain guidelines you can follow while dressing:\n\n\nFormal events — such as weddings, award ceremonies, and some religious ceremonies —require a nice cocktail dress or gown. Your dress should be at least knee-length, if not longer. Heels or nice flats are required.\nBusiness formal (also known as business professional) includes tailored trousers, knee-length skirts, blazers, button-up shirts, and nice blouses. Heels are recommended. These would be worn in a corporate setting.\nBusiness casual includes nice khakis, black slacks, button-up shirts, knee-length skirts, and cardigans. You can wear heels or nice ballet flats. This is for a more informal office setting.\nCasual dress includes jeans, t-shirts, shorts, tank tops, short skirts, and sneakers. This should be worn when doing errands, hanging out with close friends, and during informal outdoor events.[4]",
                "Maintain good posture. It is proper to sit up straight when you are at dinner or in a meeting. Brace your shoulders back so that they form a straight line. Stretch your neck so that your head is looking straight forward. Do not slump your shoulders or hunch over while you sit or walk. When sitting, do not lean back on your chair.[5]\n\nMake sure to cross your legs or keep them together when wearing a skirt.\nIf you are having trouble correcting your posture, you can do core exercises, such as Pilates or yoga.[6]",
                "Keep your promises. You should always do things that you said you would do. Keeping promises shows that you are trustworthy and dependable. If something has come up that prevents you from fulfilling your promise, call and explain the situation.\n\n\nRemember to show up for events that you signed up for.\nBe punctual. Arrive at places at the time you said you would.\nShow up to help out if you said that you could.",
                "Avoid gossip. No matter what you feel about other people, learn to keep these thoughts to yourself. It is never polite to gossip or insult others, even if they are not around to hear it. If someone has insulted you, try not to do the same to them. Take the high road by ignoring the behavior.\n\n\nAvoid correcting or criticizing others, especially people you do not know or are not close to. They may find this insulting.[7]\n\nIt is fine to vent about people now and then. Choose a trusted friend who will not gossip, or tell a family member about what is bothering you. Limit yourself to one or two people whom you trust with your secrets.",
                "Practice forgiveness. If someone has wronged you, it is good to forgive them. By holding a grudge, you will only lengthen your pain. If they apologize, tell them that you forgive them. If they don’t apologize, learn to let go of the grief by forgiving them in your heart.\n\n\nWait until someone apologizes before you tell them that you forgive them. Try to understand their position. You can say something like \"I understand where you are coming from. I want you to know that I forgive you, and I don't hold anything against you.\"",
                "Maintain composure in tough situations. This doesn't mean you can't express emotion or be upset. Don't immediately react to things — if someone has made you angry, don't explode and tear into him. Take a deep breath and try to choose your words carefully. Be mindful of your tone and the volume of your voice. Try not to take insults or slights personally — if someone is being rude, that's his problem, not yours, and don't allow yourself to be manipulated to stooping to his level.\n\n\nIf you feel that you are too angry or upset to continue the conversation, it's okay to say something like, \"I can't have this conversation with you right now. I'm going to take a walk and we can resume this when we've both cooled down.\"",
                "Learn how to say no. Maturity and elegance do not mean that you let others walk all over you. You are not expected to do everything asked of you, and you can learn to say no in a polite but firm manner. You can start with an apology before explaining why you cannot do something.\n\n\nIf you cannot help someone, you can say, “I’m so sorry, but I’m unable to help you with that. Let me know if there is anything I can do in the future.”\nIf you can’t accept an invitation, you can say, “I’m sorry that I am missing the event. I would have loved to come, but I am busy that day.”\nIf you are uncomfortable with the request, politely decline and say, “I don’t think it’s a right fit for me” or “I’m not sure that I’m the best person for that task.”",
                "Apologize sincerely. Everyone makes mistakes. Maybe you forgot to show up for a friend's birthday party, or maybe you insulted someone. Learn how to apologize. While it may be difficult to acknowledge that you were wrong, it is best to get over your pride. If possible, try to meet with them face to face to express how sorry you are. A phone call or written card are also nice ways to say sorry.[8]\n\nBe sincere in your apology. A simple “I’m sorry” will work if you have nothing else to say.\nYou can say something like, \"I understand why you're angry. I want you to know how sorry I am. Please let me know how I can make it up to you.\"\nDo not make excuses, although you can offer an explanation if you think there was a misunderstanding.",
                "Express sympathy. If something bad has happened to another person, tell them how sorry you are. Offer to help in any way that you can.\n\n\nYou can say, “I’m so sorry to hear that. My thoughts are with you and your family. Please let me know if there is anything I can do. I am here for you, even if you just need someone to talk to.”[9]\n\nYou may want to bring flowers to a funeral or donate money to a cause in the deceased's name.\nIf someone is in the hospital, take time to visit them.\nSend a card to them afterwards to let them know that you are thinking of them.",
                "Pronounce your words clearly and slowly. Enunciation is very important for communication. When speaking, pace yourself. Pronounce every syllable. Do not slur or mumble your speech. Speaking too quickly will muddle your words, and it may cause the other person to misunderstand you.[10]\n\nUse an appropriate volume. You do not want to yell while you speak, nor should you be so soft-spoken that the other person cannot hear you. As you speak, try to match the volume of the other person.",
                "Think before you speak. Carefully consider the impact of your words before you say them. Understand whether or not someone might misunderstand you, or if they might take offense. Word your statements carefully so that your meaning is not mistaken.\n\n\nAvoid talking about politics and religion. These touchy subjects can cause disagreements between family and friends.[11]",
                "Work on becoming articulate and well-spoken. Try to stop saying \"Um,\" and \"Like,\" or other filler words and avoid using slang. Expand your vocabulary (try flashcards or a word of the day email) so that you can better express yourself.",
                "Listen actively. If someone else is speaking, wait until they are finished with their idea before you respond. Do not interrupt or speak over others. There are certain things you can do to let the other person know that you are engaged in the conversation:\n\n\nNod your head as they speak.\nMake eye contact.\nOccasionally repeat back what they said.[12]",
                "Avoid cursing. Cursing can be offensive and rude. While you may feel the need to replace curse words with more polite phrases, it is better to keep your anger to yourself if you are upset or startled.\n\n\nIf you are having trouble with swearing, try keeping a swear jar where you put a dollar every time you curse. You should either donate this money or save it for an essential purchase."

        "wikiHow to Show Love": {
            "intro": "Showing our love towards those who deserve it is an art and, like any art, it takes a good deal of practice. For one thing, people respond to love in different ways. Some like to hear words, some need to see loving behavior, and others respond best to gestures. Whether it’s your friend, family member, spouse, or partner, aim to cover a broad spectrum of words and deeds in order to show them that you care about them.",
            "steps": [
                "Give compliments. Sometimes it's easy to think that the people around us know how much we care for and appreciate them, when in reality they don’t. To make it clear how much you value them, dole out the compliments. Is your friend always supportive? Say so. Does your spouse look really good today? Say so. Does she get you like no one else gets you? Say so. She'll beam with pride.\n\n\nStart with something simple. “I really appreciate you” or “I’m glad that you’re in my life” are two fail-safes.\nBoth women and men like compliments on appearance and personal qualities. “You’re so pretty/handsome/cute/adorable” can go a long way. “You are so kind/smart/sweet” is also good.\nBe genuine, though. Resist giving a compliment just to make someone feel good. If you don't like your spouse’s cooking, don't lie (but do appreciate the time and effort that she took). Compliments mean little if they are not genuine. They can be easy to see through, as well.[1]",
                "Be encouraging. Part of love is hoping that your friends and loved ones grow, and cheering them on. Say that you want to go to graduate school and bring it up with your best friend. She immediately shuts you down, telling you that it’s too much time and money. Do you feel very loved? Probably not. Keep this in mind when the time comes to show love. Encourage those around you to grow and pursue what makes them happy.[2]\n\nHere is another example. Say your boyfriend reveals that he’s always wanted to be an FBI agent. He’s thinking about changing careers to law enforcement. How do you react? He’s always been reliable. Do you encourage him to pursue his dream or do you poke fun at him? Which best shows love?\nCompliments like those above can encourage. Try to reinforce your loved one’s self-esteem by pointing out her strengths – she is hardworking, good-hearted, and talented.\nIt’s also possible to encourage a loved one through solidarity. “I believe in you” or “Remember that I’m here for you” will put wind in his sails.",
                "Ask for advice. Whether it's your mom, a neighbor, a friend, or a romantic partner, asking for someone's advice shows that you value and trust their opinion. It makes them feel good, reinforces a sense of worth, and makes your relationship stronger. There is very little to lose by asking. You'll probably gain something from the talk anyway.\n\n\nYour question doesn't have to be about anything major, either. Ask them if they have a new restaurant that they like, or where they go to get their car tuned up. While life crises are great advice-seeking moments, but you should not make up problems.",
                "Thank liberally. It is hard after years and years of a relationship to cherish a friend or loved one as you did in the beginning. Imagine you've been in a relationship for a few years. You naturally share the chores at home; you clean the dishes while he takes out the garbage. This is just what you do, but the fact of the matter is that your partner probably isn't crazy about taking out the garbage. He will appreciate your saying “thank you” and will be much happier to know that his input is noticed.[3]\n\nTry to be specific when you express thanks: i.e., “I’m really grateful that you help out with the dishes” or “Thank you for all your time.“\nTake a second to think about your partner. Odds are that they've done a handful of things with you in mind that you did not even register. Did they buy extra groceries? Wash your towels? Wait for you in the parking lot? They're showing you that they love you – return the gesture by thanking them!",
                "Have a heart-to-heart. A good way to show someone that you value them above pretty much everyone else is to open up and share your feelings. This does not just mean your secrets, necessarily. Opening up to a friend or partner shows your trust and confidence in them. It makes them feel like they're in the platinum-tier of your relationships. Of course, only take someone into your confidence if you feel comfortable. There are other ways to show love if you're not ready for this step!\n\n\nMake sure the relationship is solid before divulging your deepest, darkest secrets. Be sure that you really do trust the person. Don’t waste your secrets on a crush or a fly-by-night friend.",
                "Be a good listener. Listening can also be an act of love. Whether your friend or loved on is ranting or not, show your love without using words with your eyes and your body. Put your phone away, angle your body towards them, and hang on every word. When is the last time you had someone paying attention to you so thoroughly that you realized it? It's a pretty rare and great feeling.[4]\n\nWhile your loved one is talking, do your best to be a good listener. Give them your undivided attention. Put down anything in your hands like a phone or book, listen to what they are saying, and put thought into your response. If you don't know what to say, a nice hug helps, too.\nTry to always be a sympathetic listener, even if there is no special occasion. When your friend walks in, ask them about their day. They should have your undivided attention as if they were going through the grocery list. It is when they don't expect your attention that it matters most.",
                "Be affectionate. Humans like to be touched. We need it to thrive. We need to feel like social creatures and as if others care for us and can keep us safe. It's natural and innate. What's more, research has shown that we subconsciously like people that touch us more than those who don't.[5] Not only can you show your love through touch, but you solidify your relationship.\n\n\nLet’s be clear that by “touch” we are not just talking about intimate or sexual contact. A hand on the shoulder, a high-five, a pat on the back – they all have the same effect. Touch breaks down physical barriers, giving the cue that you acknowledge your loved one’s presence, care about them, and feel close.\nGive your loved one a good, long hug. Like other kinds of touch, hugs are great for showing love and building connections. A solid 7 seconds should do it.[6] Scientist don't know why, but seven seconds is the amount of time that it takes to establish a true connection.\nThis is no pity or consolatory hug. This is a super hug for no good reason at all. There are no underlying motives, no guilt, no sense of duty. It is loving because your only goal is to show that you care.\nIf you are both comfortable with it, a brush on the forearm, arm around the shoulder, nuzzle, or kiss are also good ways to be affectionate.",
                "Make room in your life. Relationship grow stronger when things are shared, whether it's a significant other or just a good friend. What can you share in your own life? A dresser drawer? A special glass just for them when they visit? School supplies? Literally make your loved one a part of your life. It conveys that you care.[7]\n\nPart of including your loved one in your life might be to introduce them to other friends and family. Everyone wants to be the prized friend, boyfriend or girlfriend, or even sibling. Make them feel important – important enough to talk about and brag over with other loved ones.\nAs said before, ask for advice, compliment, and thank. All of these make your loved ones aware that you are thinking about them.",
                "Reinforce an inside joke or memorable moment. Relationships are all about those little moments we spend together that no one else really understands. To show that these moments mean a lot to you, reinforce them. How? Be creative. Make a mixed CD of all those songs you geek out to. Get a photo mug made from that trip you took to the beach. Give your loved one something to remember your good times. The effort will show how much you cherished them, too.[8]\n\nThis sort of gesture doesn’t have to be big. It just has to show your friend or partner that you are paying attention.\nDid they mention how they always wished they had their own personal stock of Splenda? Bring them some packets. Did you once joke about mac n' cheese donuts? Make it happen. Now that moment is twice as memorable.",
                "Dress to impress. If you are in a romantic relationship, dress in your partner’s favorite outfit or wear something that she likes. Does your girlfriend love it when you wear a tie? Surprise her one night. Does she adore you in aviator sunglasses and a fedora? Go ahead and don them. You don't have to say anything about it; rest assured that she will know it is for her.\n\n\nThis principle applies to scents, foods, and other items. Does your husband prefer a certain wine? Buy a bottle on your way home.\nDoes your girlfriend secretly love anchovy pizza? Let her indulge once in a while. She will be more likely to mirror your actions, and you'll both be happier.",
                "Give gifts. Some people feel most loved when they receive gifts. For these people, the gifts are not as important in themselves as the act of giving, which is an expression of love. It really is the thought that counts.[9] It can be for holidays, birthdays, or anniversaries. Even better is an occasional surprise gift.\n\n\nA gift could be the timeless flowers and chocolate. Or, it could be a homemade card.\nOften the most memorable gifts are those we don’t expect. If you hear your loved one mention a book that they like, but can’t afford, she will remember it if you buy it for her.\nGrand or small, gifts say “I’m thinking about you.” The receiver sees them as an act of affirmation and love. However, make sure that your gesture follows your behavior. Imagine that you gave your mom a huge bouquet of flowers but then didn’t call her for months. Your neglect devalues the gift.",
                "Do a good deed. Imagine what it would be like to get stuck overnight at the airport. Now, what if your friend who lives two hours away offered to come and pick you up? What if a loved one floated you a no-interest loan, when you had financial problems? These are both loving gestures, giving without asking for anything immediate in return. Showing love is sometimes about giving selflessly.\n\n\nCover the tab the next time you and a loved one go out together for lunch, dinner, or coffee.\nOffer to help him with an unpleasant task, like moving or cleaning out his garage.\nSometimes the most thoughtful gifts, the ones that truly show others we love them, are ones that take sacrifice. That’s why we call these “good deeds.” If you have a friend that needs a ride to the airport at 5 AM, when you are usually sleeping, offer it anyway. The efforts shows that you value your friend more than you care about the inconvenience.",
                "Plan time together. Unlike gift receivers, some people feel most loved by spending quality time with their friends, family, and spouse. It is important that this time is together and not just in proximity. Give your loved one your full attention.[10] Plan an experience together, be it dance class, the opera, ice skating, or a paintball outing. It is a great bonding experience, and the fact that you arranged it speaks volumes.\n\n\nTime together can be watching a movie. It can be going out for coffee to catch up. It can be playing a board game or even going on a trip together.\nPlanning time together with a loved one shows that you want you want them to be an integral part of your life. You could do these things alone, but instead you chose to include them. They matter to you. And your loved one will know it.",
                "Get cooking. An old saying has it that “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.” Many people show love with food – it’s not just for men. Food and preparing food for others is one way that we build deep connections and show affection. Invite your best friend over for her favorite meal, with drinks, desserts, and appetizer. She’ll see how much you care about her.\n\n\nIt’s not a big problem if you’re not the best cook. An alternative is to arrange your loved one’s favorite activity or a favorite item. Does your spouse love horses? Plan a horseback ride. Does he love chrysanthemums? Fill a room with them. The important thing is to convey that you love him and are thinking of him.",
                "Keep in mind: people recognize and show love in different ways. You may think that you are showing love to your partner or friend all the time, but they may not catch on if you are not speaking their language. For example, some people show their love with physical touch, while others show love through gestures or through quality time. You may need to fine-tune your approach to match your beloved one's needs and expectations.[11]\n\nIt's a good idea to show love in different ways, just to cover your bases. Try gestures, words, touch, gifts, and quality time. If you want to make your loved ones feel really appreciated, show them verbally and physically how much you care. Do little things and do big things. Do quiet things and do loud boisterous things. Then you can rest assured that your love is shown."

        "How to Dress Emo (for Girls)": {
            "intro": "Fashion is a great way for people to express themselves, and dressing emo is no exception. Emo style is a more casual, emotional cousin of punk, and is rooted in themes of heartbreak, despair and introspection. Dressing emo is a way to show you're intelligent and cool.",
            "steps": [
                "Shop vintage. Vintage cuts and patterns fit well with the cerebral emo image, so thrift stores are a great place to shop (and you’ll save money!). Look for prints like polka dots, plaid or a checkered design.[1]\n\nLook for 70’s style jackets. Those are very popular amongst emo girls, and they go with everything from jeans to dresses.[2]\n\nAlso look for 50’s style vintage dresses, especially halter dresses or dresses in an A-line cut.",
                "Choose your colors. Look for understated colors, rather than flashy neons or pastels. Black is usually a big component in an emo wardrobe, but you can still wear color. Look for classic primary or jewel-toned items. [3] There really are no hard and fast rules about colors, though, so if you like something, get it. You can always accessorize to include different colors, too.",
                "Stock up on dresses. Emo dresses usually come in two different cuts: jersey or tunic dresses or fuller, A-line dresses. Try to buy dresses that fit into one of these two categories.\n\n\nDresses can and should include cool details, like a corset bodice or shoelace detailing.\nIf you prefer skirts, try to buy them short and pleated.",
                "Add leggings. Wearing dresses can be hard, especially in the winter. To make your look more seasonally appropriate, add leggings or tights. These should be brightly colored or striped and can include cool textures, like fishnets.\n\n\nIf your tights or leggings have a tear in them, even better!\nYou can also wear leggings or tights under cut-off shorts or miniskirts.",
                "Wear comfortable t-shirts. Emo girls love to express themselves, and graphic tees are a great way to do this. Buy a t-shirt with a band you like or quote that is meaningful to you. Hoodies are also a great (warm) way to express yourself.[4]\n\nTees and hoodies should fit well and should not be oversized to the point where you’re swimming in them.\nPair your tees and hoodies with a slightly faded, fitted pair of jeans. To add a bit more flair, wear a pair of striped socks over your jeans.",
                "Wear the right shoes. A pair of Converse shoes are the perfect touch to complete any emo kid outfit. Converse are the most popular shoes for emo girls, but Vans are a close second. Either pair of shoe is great to wear with pants or skirts and dresses.\n\n\nBallet flats are also a good option if you want to go a little more girly.\nTo make your shoes more fun, try switching out the original laces for something more colorful.",
                "Accessorize. Emo style is all about mixing cute with hardcore. Buy a headband with a bow on it, or a studded belt. For maximum effect, wear more than one belt at a time.[5] If you have piercings, feel free to rock them.\n\n\nChunky bracelets are also very popular in the emo girl community.\nIf you’re wearing denim, try ironing on or sewing on patches to give your look a little more flair.",
                "Dye your hair. You don’t have to change your hair color just because you want to start dressing emo, but if it’s important to you, there are lots of colors to choose from. Most emo hairstyles center around jet black hair, bleached blonde hair or some combination of the two.[6]\n\nIf you have naturally dark hair, try adding some very light highlights. If you have naturally light hair, try adding very dark lowlights.\nYou can also experiment with dying your hair different bright colors. Purple, red and pink are currently very popular, but you can dye your hair any color you’d like.\nIf you aren’t ready to commit to a big color change right now or if your parents say you can’t, try experimenting with wash out dye.[7]\n\nYou can also try streaking your hair, so the color is less aggressive. Or buy colored clip-ins and layer them amongst your natural hair color. The possibilities are endless!",
                "Get a dramatic haircut. There are certain haircuts that are strongly associated with emo culture. These haircuts include, straight hair with very sharp cuts or hair cut with very dramatic layers.[8]\n\nIf you have short hair, try a sharply angled bob cut.\nIf you have long hair, try adding long layers on both sides.[9]\n\nThere is a misconception that you can only be emo if your hair is straight. This is not true. Curly haired girls can be emo too.",
                "Tease the crown of your hair. This is a popular emo hairstyle you can pull off even without getting a haircut. To do this, take a section of your hair from the back. Using your comb, back comb or tease the bottom of this section until the crown of your hair has a little more volume.[10]\n\nBe careful not to tease too hard, or you might damage your hair.\nWhen the back of your hair is fully teased, wear your hair down, or throw it up into a casual ponytail.",
                "Get bangs. Bangs are a signature emo look for women. Bangs should be heavy and thick or styled into a fringe. Regardless of how they are cut, you’ll want them long enough to touch your eyebrows or possibly to hang over and cover part of your eyes.[11] This will allow you to hide behind your bangs when you feel sad.",
                "Enhance your eyes. Your eyes are the windows to your soul, and for emo girls, you want them to be a focal point of your face. Use eyeliner or kohl to heavily line your eyes, almost to the point where you look like a raccoon.[12]\n\nTo apply liquid eyeliner, start at the top of one eyelid and draw a line from one corner of the lid to the other. Try to draw your line at ½ a centimeter and allow it to air dry so it doesn’t smudge.[13]\n\nDraw over the liquid eyeliner with a black crayon or pencil eyeliner to make your eyes extra dark and dramatic.\nIf you’re not allowed to wear makeup to school, don’t worry! Save it for a special event or Halloween. You can still dress like an emo girl without all the makeup.",
                "Leave the rest of your face neutral. Because the eyes are such a focal point in emo makeup, the rest of your face should be left relatively untouched. Try adding pale or neutral lipgloss to make your lips pop a little. You can also add a little blush to give your cheeks a little color.[14]",
                "Have fun with your nails. Nails are a big deal for emo girls, so go crazy here. Paint them dark or bright colors or alternate between the two. If you have a little money laying around, splurge for a gel manicure so they’ll last a little longer.\n\n\nTry making your fourth finger on each hand a different color than the rest.\nUse nail decals or stickers to attach fun images like cartoon characters or skulls to your nails. Mix and match for a cool combination.[15]"

        "How to Deodorize a Car": {
            "intro": "Cars develop smell over time from food, pets, messes, and other sources. Luckily, a car is usually easy to deodorize in a few simple steps. Clean your car thoroughly and apply substances to remove odor. If you notice a potentially dangerous smell, like the smell of gas, seek professional assistance immediately. Most smells, however, can be dealt with without mechanics or professional cleaners.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for sources of odor. If you notice an unpleasant smell in your car, search your car for a potential cause. Search the floor of your car for anything that could cause odor, like clothing, spills, or food. Be sure to search under seats, in between seats, any compartments or cup holders, and in the trunk.[1]",
                "Toss out any obvious causes of a bad smell. Get a large trash bag and toss any obvious causes of odor, such as food wrappings, old napkins, and anything else. Even things like magazines can cause a musty odor if they become damp. Removing any items from your car that don't need to be there can help cut down on odor. [2]",
                "Use a vacuum to clean your car's interior. Make sure to clean everywhere in your car, including under rugs and carpeting and under seats. Vacuum down the seats as well. Make sure to place the vacuum's nozzle into the nooks or crannies of seats so you can get any dirt and debris lodged in between seats.[3]\n\nYou can use a handheld vacuum if you have one at home, but making a trip to a car wash is usually more effective. You can use the nozzle vacuum cleaner there, which should be able to thoroughly remove dirt and debris from your car that may be causing a bad smell.",
                "Remove any spills and stains from the carpeting. If you notice any spills while you're cleaning, use a commercial carpet cleaner or a shampoo from a department store. Apply the cleaner to the floor according to package directions. Then, rub the cleaner into a stain with a soft cloth or sponge and then rinse the cleaner from the car with water.[4]\n\nMost cleaners should be diluted with water prior to use.\nMake sure to test the cleaner on a small, unnoticeable portion of your car's floor first to make sure it's safe to use on your car's interior.",
                "Wipe down any non-carpeted surfaces. In addition to cleaning the carpet, wipe down any non-carpeted surfaces like the dashboard. Remove any spills and stains from these areas using a non-purpose cleaner.\n\n\nYou should test any cleaner you use on a small, inconspicuous portion of the car first to make sure it doesn't cause damage.",
                "Spray down vents with an AC cleaner. With time, a car's air conditioner vents build up dirt and debris that can cause an unpleasant smell in your car. Make sure to treat the AC while deodorizing your car. Buy an AC cleaner made for cars at a local hardware store. Spritz down the vents of the car's air conditioning system with the cleaner. This will help reduce bad smells.[5]",
                "Place a container of dryer sheets in the car. Simply fill a container with dryer sheets and place it somewhere in your car. Dryer sheets can help absorb unwanted odor and also give off a pleasant scent. After cleaning your car, placing dryer sheets in the car can help eliminate lingering odors.[6]",
                "Treat your car with white vinegar. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Spritz this mixture onto any areas in your car that are producing a bad smell. Saturate the area and let the vinegar absorb into the car. Then, use a scrub brush or other cleaning tool to scrub out the vinegar mixture. This should leave the car smelling significantly fresher.[7]",
                "Use a pet deodorizer on pet smells. Pet deodorizers are made with specific enzymes that are designed to lift and eliminate pet odors. Brands of pet deodorizers vary in how they are used, but most of them are spritzed onto a stain and left to sit for a specific time period. You then rinse the pet deodorizer out.[8]\n\nMake sure to test any pet deodorizer you're using on a small, unnoticeable area in your car first to make sure it doesn't cause a stain or damage your car.",
                "Sprinkle baking soda on seats and carpeting. Baking soda can work for a wide variety odors as it naturally lifts scents. All you have to do is sprinkle baking soda over areas in your car that smell. Let the baking soda sit for a few hours or overnight and then vacuum it up.[9]",
                "Leave a container of coffee beans in your car. Place seven ounces of coffee beans in a container and leave the container in your car. If you let the beans sit in your car, they should absorb some odor. You can also use coffee grounds, but these may spill and cause mess.[10]",
                "Recognize smells that indicate a problem. A fishy smell may indicate antifreeze is leaking into your car. Smells that come from the heat or AC system may indicate mechanical problems. These issues could be dangerous and indicate your car needs repairs, so take your car to a mechanic if you're having trouble with these smells.[11]",
                "Call a professional if you notice the scent of gas. If your car smells like gas, do not attempt to treat the issue on your own. This can be very dangerous, as it indicates a leak somewhere in the car. Do not drive your car. Instead, immediately contact a mechanic for advice.[12]",
                "Seek professional treatment for tobacco smells. Tobacco scents can get into a car's interior and usually cannot be removed without professional help. Even thorough cleanings do not always lift tobacco smells. If your car smells like tobacco, you will need professional cleaning to lift the odor.[13]\n\nKeep in mind, even professional cleaning does not have a 100% success rate at lifting tobacco odor, especially if a car was driven for years by a heavy smoker."

        "How to Keep Guppies Healthy": {
            "intro": "Guppies are the most common freshwater aquarium fish and they have beautiful and unique patterns and colors. Guppies are relatively easy to care for, and are great fish for people with little aquarium experience. However, poor water quality can lead to several illnesses that could kill your guppies. Ensure the pH and temperature of the water are within the recommended ranges, and clean the tank at least once per month. Provide filtration, light, and hiding spots in the tank, and feed your guppies a varied diet to ensure they stay healthy.",
            "steps": [
                "Provide 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each guppy. Though guppies are small fish, they still require plenty of space for swimming. Your tank should be large enough to provide 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each guppy, so if you have 4 guppies, for example, you’ll need a 4 gallon (15 L) tank. If your tank becomes overcrowded, the guppies may get sick or die.[1]",
                "Use a 1:2 male to female ratio for guppies. You can choose to keep all male or all female guppies. Alternatively, if you want both sexes, choose twice as many females as males. If you have more males than females, the males may chase and harass the females, which can kill them.[2]\n\nIn order to breed guppies, you’ll need to set up a separate breeding tank to protect the fry from other fish.",
                "Turn off the lights for at least 8 hours per day. Guppies need light to thrive during the day, but constant light can actually kill them. Set your tank light on a timer so that it goes out and night and provides the guppies with time to rest and recharge.[3]",
                "Provide hiding spots to reduce stress. To keep your fish healthy, they need to feel safe and secure. Hiding spots, like caves, tubes, logs, and plants, give guppies somewhere to rest and relax. Ensure there are enough hiding spots for all the fish in the tank.[4]",
                "Choose high-quality tropical fish flakes. Your local aquarium shop should have several brands of tropical fish flakes in stock. Choose one that contains both protein and vegetable matter to ensure your guppies are eating a balanced diet.[5]",
                "Offer flakes once or twice per day. Offer as many flakes as your guppies can eat in several minutes each morning and night. If the guppies don’t eat right away, or don’t eat all the food, skip their next feeding. Overfeeding your guppies can lead to health issues and even death.[6]",
                "Supplement with live food once per week. Fresh or frozen brine shrimp, fruit flies, mosquito larvae, daphnia, bloodworms, micro worms, and earthworms are all suitable options. Offer a small amount of cut-up live food once per week in place of flake food.[7]",
                "Clean the tank regularly. Change half the water every week to ensure the tank remains clean. Fully clean the tank, including the gravel or substrate and the equipment (such as a filter), once per month to remove parasites that could harm your guppies. Be sure to test and adjust the temperature and pH of new water before adding it to the tank.[8]\n\nWhen cleaning the tank, place the fish in a holding tank or in small containers full of water that meet the pH and temperature requirements.",
                "Keep the water temperature between 50 and 84⁰ F (10 and 29⁰ C). Fluctuations in temperature, especially if they are drastic, can stress out your guppies. Water temperature above or below the recommended levels can cause your guppies to perish. Use a tank thermometer to ensure the water temperature remains consistent.[9]\n\nAdd a small amount of hot or cold water (such as ¼ cup (59 m) at a time) to the tank to adjust the temperature. Repeat every few hours as necessary to ensure the change doesn’t shock your fish.",
                "Maintain a pH of 6.8 to 7.8. It’s important to keep the pH balanced to ensure your fish remain healthy. You should regularly measure the pH of the water using a pH meter or litmus paper and adjust it if necessary. Lower the pH using an acid buffer, or raise it using an alkaline buffer.[10]\n\nAlkaline and acid buffers are available from your local aquarium store and online.",
                "Install a filtration system. A proper filtration system is necessary to keep the water clean and your guppies healthy. Replace half of the filter media when you notice it turning brown. Avoid replacing all of the media, which can remove the healthy bacteria from the water and harm your fish.[11]\n\nFiltration systems are available online and at aquarium shops.",
                "Quarantine new and sick fish. When you introduce new guppies into a tank, they may carry bacteria and parasites along with them, which can infect other fish in the tank. The best solution is to keep them in a separate tank for at least 1 month to see whether they are carrying any pathogens. Sick fish should also be quarantined until they recover so they don’t infect their tank mates.[12]",
                "Identify fungal infection. If your fish’s body has white cotton or wool-like patches on its body or if white edges appear around the mouth, it is suffering from a fungal infection called ich. Fish with ich may also lose their appetites and rub their body against rocks or decorations in the tank.[13]",
                "Recognize bacterial infection. A disintegrating or shredding tail or fin (not due to nipping from another fish) is called rot and is a bacterial infection. If the fish’s scales or eyes protrude from its body, it is suffering from a bacterial infection called dropsy.[14]",
                "Treat fungal infections by raising the water temp or adding marine salt. Sometimes, fungus can grow in your tank and on your fish when the water temperature is too cold. Check the tank temperature and slowly increase the heat of the water, if necessary. You can also add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of marine salt per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to treat fungal infections.[15]\n\nMarine salt is available online and at aquarium stores.",
                "Provide antibiotics for bacterial infections. Visit your aquarium store or contact your veterinarian if one of your guppies has fin or tail rot, dropsy, or another bacterial infection. Explain the situation and ask for an antibiotic to treat your fish. Follow the instructions for administering the medicine carefully to ensure your fish will recover completely.[16]"

        "How to Play the Accordion": {
            "intro": "How would you play Do Re Mi Fa So La on the accordion?",
            "steps": [
                "Get the right kind of accordion. There are variety of different accordions out there, but some are more well-suited for beginners than others. The more information you gather the better equipped you will be to successfully learn to play the accordion. Here is the most suitable option for beginners[1]:\n\n\nPiano Accordions. These are the most popular kinds, with the power of a regular piano in a highly portable size. They have between 25 and 45 piano style treble keys on the right hand. On the left, they are equipped with a bass-chord keyboard. This accordion system is called the stradella, and typically has 120 brass buttons.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the instrument's structure. Your accordion is composed of several parts, all crucial to the accordion's sounds[2]:\n\n\nMelody Keys. These are buttons on the keyboard part of the instrument.\nBellows. These are the folds on the instrument that allow it to expand and contract.\nHarmonic, Base, Air Valve. These buttons provide air to escape, adjusting the tone of sound.\nRight Hand Strap. This is the main strap of the instrument that allows you to secure it onto your chest.",
                "Use the right size. Children and teens or adults will need to start off with different sizes due to the difference in hand and general body size[3].\n\n\nChildren should start with the lowest number of bass buttons, 12 bass and 25 treble keys.\nTeens and adults should start with a 48 bass accordion. This amounts to 48 bass and 26 treble keys.\nThe 48 bass Piano Accordion is very light weight, and easy to use and handle. Plus, you can play lots of different music on it, which will make you want to hang on to it even if you outgrow it.",
                "Place your accordion on your chest with the key buttons facing away from you. When you begin handling your instrument in the next section of the article, your left arm will move horizontally and vertically, while your right hand will only move vertically. For now, just hold it and see how comfortable or uncomfortable it is.",
                "Sit or stand while holding your accordion. Some people prefer to stand while playing and others like to sit with their instrument. All that matters is your sense of comfort and confidence, so try out a few different positions until you feel at ease.",
                "Don't slouch. Your body posture is very important when playing this instrument and slouching will cause you to be inaccurate in your balance and consequently in your performance.",
                "Learn proper balance. The accordion is relatively large and requires a little bit of familiarity when holding it. Being able to maintain proper balance is crucial. The more evenly balanced you manage to keep the accordion's weight, the better you'll be able to play because of the added control. And the more control you have, the less uncomfortable the weight will feel.",
                "Secure the instrument onto your chest. Slip your left arm under the strap of the instrument. You'll want to hold it as if you were putting on a backpack on your chest. The piano keys should be to your right and your left hand goes underneath the bass strap - the small strap on the left side of the instrument[4].\n\n\nNote that there is usually a thumb wheel on the left side to adjust the strap.\nMake sure that your accordion fits tightly enough not to move at all while you move.",
                "Try a back strap. An additional strap can be very useful. The back strap keeps the shoulder straps together so that the accordion doesn't move.\n\n\nNote that if the back strap is too far down it alleviates weight from the shoulders, making the straps loose on top. This, in turn, causes your straps to move and slide.\nKeep the back strap higher up, or secure it diagonally.\nRemember that when the straps stay in place, so does your instrument.",
                "Undo the safety buckles. The buckles can be found on the top and bottom of the instrument. Take care not to push or pull the accordion yet.",
                "Hold your wrist parallel to the keyboard. Don't bend your right wrist while keeping your elbow close to your side. It'll be a bit awkward at the beginning but you'll be able to achieve better accuracy as your hand's circulation won't be impeded.\n\n\nThis applies the right arm only.",
                "Slip your left hand through the strap that lies below the bass button board.You'll be able to curl your fingers up and over the bass buttons. You right hand should be free and resting above the piano keyboard.",
                "Push down on the lone button on the left hand side near the strap. Press the button down softly, and pull your instrument with your left arm. You'll hear a hissing noise as the air goes into the accordion and the bellows open.\n\n\nNote that it's important to use this button when you open and close the bellows while they're moving.\nDon't press down on the keyboard while you're opening and closing the bellows.",
                "Focus on playing bass first. No matter how many bass buttons your accordion has, you'll soon notice that they produce the chords, or vamps, automatically. This is due to the accordion's mechanism[5].\n\n\nThe term chord refers to the sound produced by a group of notes played together.\nKeep the bass buttons pressed for only a short time. Imagine they were on fire, and take your finger off quickly.",
                "Try not to look at where your fingers are going. This will be quite difficult at first, but do your best not to look at where your fingers go, or need to go[6].",
                "Find the note C. This button is usually a bit buried or recessed, but can be found on the top rows of buttons 8,12, 16, 24, 36 of all bass instruments. If your accordion is a larger model, then look for the note C in the second row.",
                "Don't focus on the piano keyboard yet. For now, your only concern should be getting comfortable with your instrument, and focusing on the first two rows of bass buttons[7].\n\n\nRegardless of how many bass rows your accordion has, you'll only be looking at the first two rows.",
                "Place your index finger on the C note. Then, tuck your thumb under your index finger and push on the button right below the note C. This button will be slightly off center, but right below the button that your index finger is pressing.",
                "Pull the bellows out. Then, press the two buttons alternately to produce a chord. You'll generate a sort of of oom-pah sound.\n\n\nTry to pull the bellows smoothly for the best sound effect.",
                "Attempt a Waltz rhythm. The beat for the Waltz goes 1, 2, 3--1, 2, 3. Play the C note on the first beat, and push the button right below the C on the second and third beat[8].",
                "Play the corresponding two buttons on each side of the two you've just learned to play. This is how you can generate a simply accompaniment, or vamp.",
                "Add the bellows. Now try to pull the bellows in as you alternately press the four buttons you just learned. Repeat this several times to practice.",
                "Practice with little exercises. Let's try another easy scale exercise that will help you produce your first, controlled sound sequence[9]:\n\n\nExpand the instrument's bellows.\nSoftly and evenly push it back together, and hold the 1st key down.\nKeep pressing the note key while you change directions by pulling the instrument in opposite directions.\nGo to the next key, push in and pull apart.\nJump to the next key, and you have now played Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La.",
                "Try a more difficult exercise. This exercise has two chords, and you can leave your fingers on the keyboard. Place your thumb on the C, and pinky on the G: begin with the third finger on the E[10].",
                "Continue practicing. Coordination might seem a little difficult at first, so it's important that you become very familiar with the necessary movements. Repeat the above exercise until you feel confident and can move on to more advanced practices."

        "How to Identify Enlarged Heart Symptoms": {
            "intro": "An enlarged heart, also known as a cardiomegaly, is a condition associated with many heart problems. While there are often no direct symptoms associated with an enlarged heart, you might experience shortness of breath, heart palpitations or an irregular heartbeat, and weight gain or swelling of the body and/or legs. Detecting an enlarged heart is easy with MRI, CT scans, ultrasound, EKGs, and X-rays.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for shortness of breath.[1] An enlarged heart cannot contract as well as a normal-sized heart. Because your heard does not pump as well, excess fluid backs up into your lungs, leading to shortness of breath.[2]\n\nThis symptom might be most noticeable when lying down or when engaging in physical activity.\nYou may find it hard to exercise or wake up in the middle of the night feeling short of breath.",
                "Watch out for swelling.[3] Swelling of body parts due to fluid buildup (edema) is a common symptom associated with an enlarged heart. It occurs for the same reason you develop shortness of breath: your poor circulation means that fluid cannot drain properly from your lungs, abdomen, and legs.[4]\n\nSwelling in the legs is the most common form of edema associated with an enlarged heart.\nYou may incorrectly interpret the swelling as weight gain. If you experience a steady and inexplicable increase in your weight along with other symptoms of an enlarged heart, consult a doctor.[5]",
                "Look for arrhythmia.[6] Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. If you can feel your heartbeat speeding up or slowing down inexplicably, you may have arrhythmia. This condition can be harmless, but it could also be cause for concern. Signs of arrhythmia include:[7]\n\nFainting or near fainting\nSweating\nChest pain\nShortness of breath\nPalpitations — A palpitation can be an increased or decreased heart rate, irregular rhythm, or a skipped or missed beat",
                "Pay attention to chest pain and coughing.[8][9] Chest pain is often a secondary symptom caused by arrhythmia; however, coughing and chest pain deserve special attention because if present, you could be close to a heart attack.[10] If you’re experiencing serious chest pain and coughing, contact a doctor immediately.\n\n\nIf you’re coughing up a lot of frothy, watery sputum (saliva and mucus), you may be on your way to heart failure, a common consequence of an enlarged heart. You may also notice trace amounts of blood in your sputum.[11]",
                "Monitor feelings of fatigue.[12] An enlarged heart makes it difficult to circulate blood properly throughout your body. Without an adequate amount of blood circulating, you may start to feel fatigued and dizzy. A decreased blood supply to your brain, especially, can lead to feelings of fatigue or lethargy.\n\n\nKeep in mind that fatigue can be a symptom of many conditions and does not particularly mean that you have an enlarged heart.",
                "Have an echocardiogram (echo) done. This is considered the best way to diagnose an enlarged heart.[13] An echo is a painless procedure in which the doctor uses ultrasound technology to examine the movement of blood through your heart on a monitor.[14]\n\nThe anatomical structure and functional activities of the four chambers of your heart can be assessed with this test. The valves of your heart can also be observed\nIf your doctor finds that the walls of your heart’s left ventricle are larger than 1.5 centimeters (about half an inch), your heart is considered enlarged.[15][16] This test records the electrical activities of your heart and can detect irregularities in your heart’s rhythm.[17] It can also aid in analyzing how a particular chamber of the heart has been enlarged. The heart’s activities are recorded on a graph.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Identify Enlarged Heart Symptoms Step 7\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Identify-Enlarged-Heart-Symptoms-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid4900821-v4-728px-Identify-Enlarged-Heart-Symptoms-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nAn EKG provides information about heart rate, rhythm, and any conduction defects in the heart.",
                "Ask your doctor to take an X-ray.[18] If you and your doctor suspect you have an enlarged heart, your doctor will probably make you get an X-ray. X-ray images can help your doctor see the size and condition of your heart.\n\n\nAn X-ray can also help to determine if you have any irregular enlargement of parts of your heart, or if the shape of your heart has changed.",
                "Do a stress test.[19] A stress test can determine if you have an enlarged heart due to blockage in your heart arteries. Also known as an exercise stress test or exercise tolerance test, you will walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike for a given amount of time while doctors monitor your heart rate and blood pressure. If you have an enlarged heart, your heart will have a hard time coping with the physical activity, and the results will help you discover that you have an enlarged heart.",
                "Get blood tests.[20] An enlarged heart may disrupt the production and levels of certain substances in your blood. By measuring the amount of these substances in your blood, a doctor can determine if you have an enlarged heart or a related condition.",
                "Talk to your doctor about a cardiac catheterization and biopsy.[21] Catheterization involves inserting a tube (catheter) into your groin and threading it through your body into your heart.[22] A small sample of heart tissue can be removed and examined later. This technique is not usually necessary, since other techniques of diagnosis are less invasive and easier to perform.\n\n\nDuring the procedure, the doctor might be able to capture images of the heart to visualize what your heart looks like.",
                "Exercise.[23] Exercise is recommended for most people with heart failure. The level of exercise you should aim for varies with your age, weight, gender, and physical ability. Talk to your doctor about how much you can and should work out.\n\n\nSome people with heart valve problems should not exercise. Talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen if you already have cardiomegaly or other heart problems.\nIf you are just getting back into exercising, start with a daily walk. You can start with as little as 10 minutes, then work your way up to 30 minutes.",
                "Maintain normal blood pressure.[24] High blood pressure causes the heart to work harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body. This can lead to an enlarged heart, by causing enlargement and thickening of the heart muscle.\n\n\nAsk your doctor for medications to lower your blood pressure.\nAvoid salt and foods high in sodium to reduce your blood pressure.\nDon’t use diet pills to lose weight. They raise blood pressure.[25]",
                "Manage medical conditions.[26] There are many medical disorders that can lead to cardiomegaly. If you have diabetes, amyloidosis, or valvular heart disease, you have a higher risk of cardiomegaly than the general population. Let your doctor know if you have a family history of heart problems. You can also talk to your doctor about getting a blood test done to diagnose potential heart problems.\n\n\nPay attention to thyroid disorders. Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart.\nIf you have valvular heart disease, you might need medications or surgery. Talk to your doctor about how to treat your valvular heart disease.[27]\n\n\nAnemia can cause a heart to become enlarged. Anemia occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (a protein found in red blood cells) to carry oxygen to your tissues. Your heart must then pump harder to deliver enough oxygen to the rest of your body. This can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat.",
                "Hemochromatosis occurs when your body cannot metabolize iron properly. A buildup of iron can be toxic to your organs and weaken your heart muscle, leading to an enlarged left ventricle.\n\n\nManage medical conditions in concert with your doctor in order to prevent an enlarged heart.",
                "Adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle.[28] Get eight hours of sleep each night. Take time out of your day to relax and enjoy yourself by walking around your neighborhood, watching TV, or reading a book. Engage in moderate physical activity for about 30 minutes each day. Limit the amount of salt, caffeine, and fat in your diet. Eat a diet of mostly whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with moderate amounts of protein.\n\n\nTalk to your doctor about exercising. Some individuals with cardiomegaly cannot exercise because it might exacerbate their condition.\nUse your alarm clock or watch to determine when you should go to bed and wake up each day. Having a regular sleep schedule helps the body adjust to sleeping the right amount.",
                "Talk to your doctor if you have had a heart attack.[29] If you have had a heart attack in the past, you are more likely to develop an enlarged heart than people who have not experienced a heart attack. Cardiac muscles cannot regenerate, which means that a part of your heart will be weaker than your normal heart tissue.\n\n\nWhen your heart has both healthy and weak tissue, the healthy tissue may become enlarged as it is forced to do more work.",
                "Steer clear of drugs and alcohol.[30] Drugs and alcohol are connected to 30% of all cases of enlarged hearts. Alcohol and drugs break down heart muscle cells. Heavy drinking, especially, can lead to poor nutrition, which limits the heart’s ability to repair itself. As a result, your heart muscles may become structurally weak, producing enlargement. Therefore, avoid drinking alcohol and using drugs.\n\n\nIf you are addicted to drugs or alcohol, speak to a substance abuse counselor. Talk to a therapist to confront the underlying reasons why you drink and abuse drugs.\nGet support from groups like Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nDo not smoke. Risk of heart attack greatly increases in smokers. People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day have more than twice the risk of heart attack than non-smokers. Use nicotine gum and patches to control cravings, and gradually reduce the amount you smoke each week until you’ve kicked the habit."

        "wikiHow to Keep Dogs in the Same House from Fighting": {
            "intro": "If you have multiple dogs in the same household, occasional fighting may be a problem for you. Fortunately, by promoting balance at home, preventing aggressive behavior, and understanding when you should intervene you can minimize fighting and foster social stability among your dogs. By taking proactive steps and stepping in when necessary, you can promote a healthy social structure at home and reduce instances of fighting among your dogs.",
            "steps": [
                "Do not reward aggressive behavior. Many people mischaracterize aggressive behavior as normal disputes over “alpha” status, and they mistakenly try to reinforce the apparent hierarchy among their pets. In fact, dominance hierarchies are usually not obvious to humans and may vary depending on the situation. When dogs disagree with each other, they typically settle the dispute using body language and vocalizations with minimal contact.\n\nIn most cases, a dog that physically attacks the other dog is behaving inappropriately. Rewarding aggressive behavior in these “alpha” dogs only serves to make them more confident in their aggression, and can escalate the situation.",
                "Prevent situations that promote aggression. Consider situations that seem to cause your dogs to fight.\n\nFor example, if the disputes seem to be related to resources, like high-value treats or favorite toys, gather up these items and keep them in a safe place until you can provide supervised play. Similarly, if your dogs seem to fight only when there is excitement, such as when guests come over, you should anticipate this and put them in separate rooms or crates before your company arrives.",
                "Feed dogs separately. Provide each dog with its own separate bowl, with plenty of space between them. If your dogs show signs of aggression while eating, you may even consider feeding them in different rooms. When feeding time is over, remove any uneaten food to prevent dogs from eating each others’ leftovers.[1]\n\nIf you provide a treat or bone, provide one for each dog.\nOne water bowl for all dogs is usually fine, however, if one dog seems to be protective of the water bowl, provide separate bowls for the dogs.",
                "Provide separate sleeping areas. Just like food bowls, each dog needs a separate area (such as a dog bed or crate) to sleep. In multi-dog households, dogs will usually select where they sleep. They may switch beds at times or even sleep together. The important thing is to ensure that each dog has enough space when it needs it.[2]\n\nYou might consider crate training your dogs.\nIf you do this, be sure to provide a comfortable crate for each of your dogs.",
                "Introduce new animals slowly. Anytime you bring a new animal home, everyone in your household needs a little time to adjust. If you introduce a new dog or puppy slowly and carefully, the dogs are less likely to fight, and are more likely to quickly determine their social standing with one another.[3]\n\nAllow them to meet on neutral territory, such as a park. Ask a friend (or someone from the shelter) to bring the new dog.\nWhen you bring it home, confine the new dog to one room of the house. Allow it to explore the house in time.\nExpect some posturing. Dogs may need to tussle a little bit to determine their rank, but it should happen rather quickly.",
                "Have your dogs \"fixed.\" Dogs that have not been spayed or neutered may be more likely to fight with other dogs. If your dogs have not been spayed or neutered, doing so may lessen the appearance of aggressive behavior. Talk to you vet about having this procedure done on your animals.[4]\n\nCosts for spaying and neutering will vary depending on where you live.",
                "Socialize your dogs. You can help prevent aggressive behavior in your dogs by making sure they are adequately socialized. Dogs are most easily socialized between 3 and 12 months. If your adult dog exhibits serious behavioral issues around other people or other dogs, consider seeking help from an animal behaviorist or veterinarian. You can socialize your dog by exposing it to a variety of experiences, including:\n\n\nDifferent kinds of people.\nChildren.\nOther dogs (both large and small).\nOther animals (like cats).\nNoises.\nTravel.",
                "Work on dog-to-dog socialization. Although puppies may have fun wrestling with a group of other puppies, most adult dogs will find situations with large groups of dogs (such as a dog park) to be a bit stressful. You can work on each of your dog's dog-to-dog socialization, by doing it gradually, and with just one dog at a time.[5]\n\nInvite a friend to bring their easy-going dog on a walk with you and one of your dogs.\nAllow a polite distance between the dogs.\nIf both dogs are calm, allow them to sniff one another.\nIf both dogs seem relaxed and their tails are wagging, allow them to play together off their leashes.\nRepeat this process until your dog feels more comfortable around other dogs.",
                "Watch out for signs of stress. Dogfights are usually the result of stress. Dogs can be very sensitive to their environments, and can become quite stressed—and thereby aggressive—over seemingly simple things. If you are aware of your dogs’ stressors, you can better prevent a fight.[6] Some common stress factors can include:\n\n\nBad weather (especially thunder).\nFood or a treat present.\nPeople arguing or being emotional.\nChanges to their routine.\nNot getting enough exercise.\nLoud noises (such as fireworks).",
                "Recognize specific triggers. In addition to stress factors, each dog may have specific triggers that can cause undue aggression. Triggers can make your dog uncomfortable and/or defensive, but knowing what they are can help you prevent fights. Pay attention to the way your dog behaves under different circumstances.[7] Some triggers can include:\n\n\nInjury or pain – If a dog is in pain, it may feel threatened by another dog.\nProtection – If your dog thinks you are in danger, it may act out to protect you.\nUnclear hierarchy – If one dog refuses to defer to another, they may fight to determine their places.",
                "Watch the eyes. If one of your dogs is uncomfortable, it will stare intensely at the other dog. The other dog may either return the stare, or lose interest. If both dogs are locked in an intense stare, be aware that tensions may be rising. To prevent a fight, you may want to separate the dogs.[8]",
                "Recognize the dogs’ posture and body language. Certain dog movements--such as pulling their lips back, holding their head high or low, or baring their teeth—are meant to communicate a warning. If your dogs are acting this way towards one another, it may be best to separate them.[9]",
                "Listen to the growls. If your dogs are making low, rumbly growls at one another, this can also indicate a warning. However, growls can sometimes be misleading. Look for the dogs’ body language and other behaviors whenever you notice a growl. If it seems like they might be posturing to fight, it is best to separate them.[10]\n\nAll dog growls will sound a little different.\nIt is important to listen to your dog and get a sense of the way it vocalizes.",
                "Break up a fight, when necessary. If your dogs do manage to get into a physical brawl, you may need to intervene to prevent injury. Try some methods that can be done from a distance, in order to best prevent yourself from getting hurt. Some strategies include:\n\n\nMake a loud noise.\nSpray them with water.\nUse a barrier to split them up (such as a piece of wood).\nThrow a blanket over them.",
                "Deal with the aftermath of a fight. After a fight has been broken up, it is a good idea to keep the dogs separated for up to 48 hours. In this time, you'll need to tend any wounds and provide comfort to each dog. You'll also want to be careful about how you reintroduce them.[11]\n\nTend wounds - Check both dogs for wounds. Any puncture can become infected, so clean any injuries and/or take dogs to the vet.\nProvide comfort - Give plenty of affection and attention to each dog. They are likely to be shaky and nervous for a couple of days.\nReintroduce them - After a waiting period, ask to friend to help you reintroduce the dogs. Meet at a neutral space and allow the dogs to sniff each other while they are leashed. If there are no signs of aggression, the dogs have probably moved on. If they continue to be aggressive, keep them separated for a while and try again.",
                "Consult with an experienced animal behaviorist or trainer. Mild aggression between dogs can usually be handled at home. However, aggression can quickly become dangerous and even deadly. If your dogs cannot seem to get along, do not hesitate to call a professional."

Ginger is commonly used in savory stir-fry dishes, in sweets like gingersnaps, and even in cocktails like the Moscow Mule. Ginger is a delicious root, but the problem is that it's hard to use the ginger from one root at once, which leads to the problem of storing it. If you want your ginger to last a few weeks -- or even a few months -- then you need to know how to store ginger in the freezer and refrigerator. If you want to know how to store ginger, just follow these steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose the freshest ginger. If you want your ginger to last as long as possible, then you have to pick out the freshest ginger root and use it shortly after purchasing. To find the freshest ginger, look for ginger with a fresh and spicy fragrance and a nice smooth skin. The rhizomes of the ginger should feel heavy and firm in your hands. Avoid any ginger that's wrinkled or feels a bit soft, or you'll be eating ginger that's already on the decline.\n\n\nAvoid any ginger that is wet, moist, or moldy.\nDecide whether to store the ginger in the freezer or refrigerator. If you know you'll be using the ginger again soon, then you should just store it in the refrigerator to make it easy to use, peel, or mince the ginger in the future. Ginger can last in the refrigerator for up to three weeks, so if you know you won't be using it before then, then you should store it in the freezer.\nYou can also mix and match. If you know you'll be using a small chunk of the ginger soon, then you can cut off a chunk and refrigerate it and then freeze the rest of the ginger for use in the more distant future.",

To store ginger in a zipper storage bag, simply take the unpeeled ginger and place it in a zipper bag, taking care to push all of the air out of the bag. Place it in the veggie crisper in your fridge and have it stay crisp and fresh for several weeks. When compared to other methods, such as storing the ginger in a paper bag or wrapping it with a paper towel and then placing it in the bag, this method came up lasting the longest by quite a few weeks.[1]\n\nIf the ginger is already peeled, this method will work too, but it won't last as long as it would with the peel on.",

        "wikiHow to Garnish Wages in Virginia": {
            "intro": "Wage garnishment is a legal method of debt collection. You can request a court order instructing the debtor's employer to withhold some of the debtor's earnings to pay for a court judgment, child support, or other debt. To garnish someone's wages, you must file the appropriate forms with the court and potentially attending a hearing.",
            "steps": [
                "Get a judgment. You need to sue and be awarded a judgment before you can garnish someone’s wages. If a debtor is behind on repaying a loan, you cannot immediately skip ahead to wage garnishment. Instead, you need to sue for the amount owed. Once you get a judgment from a court, then you can use wage garnishment to help you collect on the debt.\n\n\nTo get a judgment, you must sue the debtor in civil court or small claims court. Ask the court clerk for the necessary forms, file them, have a process server serve the defendant, and attend a hearing. You can also garnish the debtor's wages to pay child or spousal support if a child support or spousal support order was entered as part of your divorce decree.\nIf you want to garnish wages for unpaid child support, contact the Virginia Department of Social Services at 1-800-468-8894.[1] They can assist you with enforcing your support order. Otherwise, as long as you have a copy of your support order, you can file for a garnishment yourself. Also see How to Enforce a Child Support Order.\nTypically, you cannot get a garnishment order for a judgment that is less than 21 days old.[2]",
                "Try to collect informally. It may be worth your time to contact the debtor and try to collect the debt informally. You can write the debtor a letter and include a phone number as well as a good time for the debtor to contact you.\n\n\nIt can save you time and legal fees to try to collect informally. Unfortunately, the debtor may be counting on you not to follow through with collection. On the other hand, the debtor may be willing to pay you informally to avoid having a garnishment order delivered to his or her employer, which can be embarrassing.\nFor more information on how to collect on a court judgment, see How to Collect a Judgment. Pay particular attention to what you are not allowed to do, e.g., contact the debtor at certain times in the day.",
                "Find out if the debtor has a job. Before going through the garnishment process, you should assure yourself that the debtor has a job. You can look on websites such as LinkedIn or Facebook to see if the debtor lists a particular occupation or employer.\n\n\nYou may also want to conduct a simple internet search of the debtor’s name. The results may yield employer-related websites containing the debtor’s name.",
                "Consider hiring a lawyer. The process for successfully garnishing someone’s wages can be complex. You not only have to file a motion in court but you might have to defend against a debtor’s claim that wages are exempt. There may be other collection methods that might be more effective, especially if the debtor does not make much money but does own property.\n\n\nYou can get referrals from friends and family, or from attorneys who may not practice civil law or collections but know a trusted colleague who does. You can also use referral services through the Virginia State Bar http://www.vsb.org/, or just search online.",
                "Let the debtor's employer do the final calculation. The debtor's employer knows how much the debtor is earning, so it is the employer's responsibility to calculate how much to withhold based on the formulas provided by the court. An employer who receives a garnishment order is called a garnishee. If the garnishee fails to withhold the debtor's earnings according to the order, the garnishee may be found to be in contempt of the court order.[3]\n\nIf you know how much the debtor makes, you can do the calculations yourself, or use the rules to estimate how much you can expect to receive under the garnishment order.",
                "Calculate the debtor's earnings. Earnings include any compensation paid for the debtor's services. They include wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, and payments to any pension or retirement program. Earnings include payments directly to the debtor, to the debtor as an independent contractor, and payments to another entity on behalf of the debtor. [4]",
                "Subtract deductions to find the debtor's disposable earnings. \"Disposable earnings\" are any earnings left over after the employer has made the deductions required by law.[5] Deductions made at the request of the debtor are not required by law, and should be included in the calculation of disposable earnings.[6]",
                "Use the disposable earnings figure to estimate how much you will be able to garnish. Virginia's law permits you to garnish the lesser of either (1) 25% of the debtor's disposable earnings, or (2) the debtor's disposable earnings minus 40 times the federal minimum hourly wage.[7]\n\nAs of 2015, the federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. $7.25 multiplied by 40 is $290. Thus, if the debtor makes less than $290 per week, you will not receive anything.\nRemember that the debtor can challenge the garnishment in court and claim certain exemptions. For example, if the debtor makes no more than $1,750.00 per month and has a dependent child at home, he or she can claim $34 per week to support that child.[8]",

The clerk will stamp all of your copies and return them to you.\n\n\nFiling fees vary by county. In Fairfax County, the fees amount to $49.50 for judgments under $500, and $59.50 for judgments over $500. These do not include service fees.[10] If you cannot afford the fee, ask the court clerk for information on how to file for a fee waiver.",

Expect to pay an additional fee for this service. You may need to deliver the forms to the sheriff's office yourself. The sheriff will deliver copies of your forms on your behalf.",
                "Wait for a response. The employer must either file a response with the court or begin withholding wages from the debtor. During this period, the debtor may also file a claim of exemption with the court, arguing that he or she should not be subject to a garnishment order due to their financial circumstances.",
                "Receive payment. If there are no objections by the debtor or the employer, then the garnished wages will be sent either to the levying agency, who will collect the money and then disburse it to you, or it will be sent directly to you.[11] If the debtor files objections, claiming that he or she is exempt from the order, then you will need to object to any claimed exemptions by filing an objection and attending a hearing.",
                "Receive the debtor’s answer. The debtor can attempt to halt the garnishment by claiming an exemption. This is done by filing Form DC-454, available at http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/courtdocs/civil-forms/Garnishment_Request_for_Hearing.pdf. Exemptions are provided by law and allow debtors to get out from having their wages garnished. The most common exemption is that the debtor needs the funds to support his or her own family. This is called a “head of household” exemption.",
                "File an objection. If you dispute the debtor’s claim of exemption, you can file an objection. Contact the court clerk to find out if your county provides a form you can use to object to the claimed exemption. If not, you may need to file a written objection with the court, or just attend the hearing and oppose the claim of exemption in person.",
                "Arrive early. You should give yourself plenty of time to get to the courthouse, pass through any security, and arrive at the courtroom with 15 minutes or so to spare.\n\n\nBe sure to leave all food and drinks outside the courthouse. If you need a morning coffee, consume it all before entering the building.",
                "Argue your position to the judge. You should explain to the court why you think the exemption should not apply. This could be difficult if you do not know much about the debtor’s life, e.g., whether or not the debtor has other children to take care of.\n\n\nOne reason to try and settle the debt informally with the debtor is so that you can discover if he or she is the head of household. If you find out that the debtor is not a head of household, then you can disclose your conversations to the judge at the hearing should the debtor claim a head of household exemption.",
                "Serve the order on the employer. You may need to arrange to have the court's order denying the claimed exemption served upon the debtor's employer. If you are unsure of how to proceed after the judge has ruled, ask the court clerk.\n\n\nIf the employer refuses to comply with the garnishment order, then you can bring an action in court to hold the employer liable for the payments.[12] Speak with an attorney if necessary."

        "How to Improve Your Study Routine with Exercise": {
            "intro": "Studying and passing your classes can be difficult, and finding effective ways to study may seem impossible. Recent studies have found strong links between cognitive function, memory recall, and brain function and exercise, which points to the benefits of adding physical activity to your study routine. If you are looking for a way to boost your studying, try incorporating daily exercise into your routine.",
            "steps": [
                "Exercise just before you study. If possible, do physical activity before you study. Go for a jog before you sit down to study for a test or go over your class notes. Hit the gym on the way home to swim some laps so you are ready to study that evening.[1]\n\nDoing aerobic activity gets blood, oxygen, and nutrients to your brain, which helps your brain function better.[2]",
                "Try light exercise while you study. A few studies have shown that performing light exercise while studying can help recall of information. If you are going to exercise while studying, just make sure to keep it gentle.[3]\n\nThese studies found that vigorous exercise while studying may hurt recall because your brain is focused on the workout instead of the information.\nTo try this, take your textbook or notes to the gym. Use the stationary bike while you study for at least half an hour, making sure to keep the intensity light and gentle. You can also use an elliptical, treadmill, or stairclimber.[4]",
                "Go to the gym right after studying. Studies have shown that exercising before and while you study are not the only times that benefit your recall and mental processing. Working out after a study session can also help boost your mental function and improve your studying.[5]\n\nGo for a walk or even lift weights after you study to help your brain stay active so your studying can pay off.",
                "Take a walk around the library. If you are studying in the library, break up your study sessions with physical activity. Get up and take a fifteen-minute stroll around the building or around campus nearby.[6]\n\nYou can also do this if you are studying in your dorm or a coffee shop.\nTaking a break helps refresh yourself and gets blood flowing to the brain, which can help you think and remember better.",
                "Exercise at your desk. You can get your blood pumping at your desk while you study. If you don’t want to leave everything and go for a quick 15 minute stroll, try getting some physical activity in where you are.[7]\n\nDo some chair squats at your desk. Stand up from your chair, then squat down without sitting down. Hover just above the chair for about 10 seconds. Repeat this 20 times.[8]\n\nTry wall sitting. Lean against the wall and slowly lower yourself into a squat position, using the wall to support your back. Hold for as long as you can, or do 20 sets while holding for 10 seconds each. You may also wish to lift one leg as you hold the squat for an extra challenge.\nUse resistance bands while you sit there and study. Put one in each hand and pull on them for an upper body workout. You can also try holding hand weights and doing bicep curls while studying.",
                "Determine an appropriate amount of exercise. Adding exercise to your schedule may take some planning, but it won’t be impossible. To get the benefits of the physical activity, schedule 150 minutes of exercise into your week.[9][10]\n\nAdults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or a combination of these.[11]\n\nAdolescents should get at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity each day.[12]",
                "Choose an aerobic exercise. There are so many activities you can do for aerobic exercise. You can join intramural sports teams, go for walks with friends, or hit your college’s gym. Make sure to think about whether you are doing moderate or vigorous intensity workouts.[13]\n\nModerate physical activity includes brisk walking at three miles per hour or faster or bicycling slower than 10 miles per hour. You can also play doubles tennis, go ballroom dancing, or do general gardening.\nVigorous intensity workouts include race walking, jogging, or running or cycling faster than 10 miles per hour. You can also swim laps, play singles tennis, do aerobic dancing, jump rope, or hike with a heavy backpack or uphill.[14]\n\nMany gym classes provide excellent opportunities for vigorous and moderate exercise.\nAny aerobic activity should be performed for at least 10 minutes at a time to gain brain-boosting benefits. You should also spread it out throughout the week to keep your brain focused and sharp.",
                "Make time for your workout. Committing to an exercise program to help your studies may be difficult at first. Keep in mind the mental and cognitive benefits of the exercise and how it will help improve your school performance.[15]\n\nSit down and list all your commitments, activities, and study hours. Don’t forget to list sleep times, meal times, and time for other things, like showering. Look for places you can incorporate exercise.\nDon’t forget to count daily exercise. If you walk 10 or more minutes to class or work, this counts as aerobic physical activity. If you can start walking to class, make that one of your changes.\nChoose something that you believe you will enjoy and that can easily be placed into your schedule. If you have trouble finding time to workout, consider going out for a 30 minute jog or dancing around your room for half an hour.\nBreaking up exercises into smaller increments, such as three 10-minute fast-paced walks, can offer brain-boosting benefits if you struggle fitting exercise into your day.[16]",
                "Focus on consistency. Consistent daily workouts, or workouts that coincide with your studying and classes, are more effective than trying to get 150 minutes of physical activity in on the weekend. The consistent physical activity throughout the week will boost your brain during the week, closer to when you study, instead of isolating it on the weekend.[17]\n\nIf you have class three times a week and study on those days, try to go for at least a 30 minute walk or jog before you go back to your room to study. If you go to school every day for eight hours, spend half an hour to an hour after school lets out doing something physical, then study after you get home.[18]",
                "Make the exercise an enjoyable experience. Exercise is great for relieving stress and reducing anxiety. Therefore, try not to make the physical activity a stressful part of your day. Allow yourself the time to take care of yourself. Remember, though you are not studying or working when you exercise, you are helping to boost your overall studying effectiveness.\n\n\nListen to music while exercising. Numerous studies have linked music to stress relief and the reduction of anxiety. While out for your walk, listen to music that either relaxes you or makes you happy.[19]\n\nExercise with a friend. This can do two things at once: get physical activity into your day while letting you socialize, which can help boost your mood and reduce stress.[20]",
                "Know that exercise boosts mental function. Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental alertness and cognitive function. Your brain works better and you can think more clearly after exercising.[21][22]\n\nPhysical activity also helps boost memory and recall, which is important when studying.\nAerobic exercise helps pump blood to your brain, which helps give it oxygen and nutrients that it needs to work and process information.",
                "Exercise to reduce stress. Exercise has many benefits, but one important benefit for students is that exercise helps boost your mood. Regular exercise helps reduce anxiety, which you may feel because of your studies.[23]\n\nRegular aerobic exercise has been found to help reduce tension, stabilize your mood, and reduce stress.\nJust five minutes of cardio can help start to reduce anxiety.[24]",
                "Incorporate exercise to improve energy. Exercise provides multiple benefits that help improve your energy. This is important if you are a student trying to study for multiple exams or classes. Doing some aerobic exercise may be more effective than hitting the coffee shop.[25]\n\nRegular exercise boosts energy levels.\nSince exercise reduces stress, it helps reduce fatigue associated with elevated stress levels.\nExercise boosts your ability to sleep. Adequate rest helps you feel more alert and allows your brain to function better as you study.[26]"

        "How to Soundproof a Ceiling": {
            "intro": "Neighbor noise through the ceiling if one of the single biggest complaints people have in a multi-family dwelling. Ideally you would treat the floor above, but if you're reading this article, chances are you are not on great terms with the neighbors upstairs. Adding extra drywall should help, but for best results, you'll need to take out the existing drywall and install a multi-stage setup. Both methods are achievable as a do-it-yourself project.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand this method. This is a middle ground approach, moderately effective and relatively easy to install. You can expect it to add roughly 6 to 9 \"STC points,\" reducing loud conversations to indistinct speech or murmurs.[1][2] If you're trying to block music and other loud noises, decouple the ceiling instead.[3]\n\nUse the decoupling method for concrete ceilings as well.",
                "Install insulation if needed. Drill a quarter-sized hole in the ceiling and look for insulation. If none is present, blow in cellulose or medium density fiberglass insulation.[4] There is no need to repair the holes afterward, since you will be installing new drywall underneath.\n\n\nDo not install new insulation if there's any old insulation, even if it's worn out. The old insulation will prevent you from blowing in new insulation evenly.\nAvoid foam insulation and expensive \"extra dense\" products. These can make low density vibrations worse.[5][6]",
                "Apply damping compound to a new drywall sheet. \"Green Glue\" or another damping compound will reduce vibration between the two layers of material. Apply it to the back of a new sheet of drywall, according to label instructions.\n\n\n⅝\" (15.9mm) drywall is recommended, since extra mass blocks more sound. However, if the existing drywall is ⅝\" thick, choose ½\" (12.7mm) sheets for the new layer. Different thicknesses resonate at different frequencies, so two different types will block more sound.[7]\n\nYou can buy pre-dampened drywall, but this is expensive and no different from what you could make yourself.[8]",
                "Install the drywall. Screw the drywall to the underside of your ceiling. Try to keep the gap around the perimeter as small as possible.",
                "Fill all gaps with acoustical caulk. Even a narrow gap around the perimeter or ceiling fixture can let a lot of noise through. Before choosing an acoustical caulk, read the label carefully:\n\n\nConfirm the caulk is suitable for use on your materials.\nCheck whether you can paint over the caulk. If not, make sure the color matches your ceiling.\nConsider a fire-resistant caulk to prevent spread of fire between floors. This may be required by your local building code.",
                "Wait for the compound to dry. The damping compound is a major part of this installation. It may take ten days or more for the compound to cure fully and reach its final soundproofing qualities.[9] Check the compound label for a specific time frame.",
                "Add an additional layer if necessary. If soundproofing is improved but still not ideal, consider repeating the process. A third layer of drywall and damping compound can make a significant difference.[10]\n\nIf the room is not noticeably more soundproof, another layer is unlikely to help. It may be more effective to treat the ceilings in adjacent rooms, or to soundproof the walls.",
                "Remove the existing ceiling drywall. The current drywall is in direct contact with the ceiling joists. This allows sound from the floor above to pass directly through the joists with little resistance. Once the old drywall is removed, you can install a new ceiling with an air gap between it and the floor above.",
                "Reinforce the floor above (recommended). Decoupling alone is very effective at reducing the sound of conversation and high-pitched noises, but it can make low frequencies (such as stomping feet) sound louder! To get the best of both worlds, apply damping compound to a new sheet of thick drywall and screw it onto the subfloor from below.[11]\n\n\nSee above for detailed instructions. Take care not to use screws that break through the floor above.\nAlternatively, complete the rest of this method first, then reinforce the new ceiling with a second layer. Reinforce both ends if extreme soundproofing is required.",
                "Install insulation between the ceiling joists. Standard R19 fiberglass insulation is just as good as the more expensive \"acoustic\" insulation. Fill the gaps between the joists, but avoid over-compression, which can carry vibrations through the floor.[12]\n\nCellulose, mineral fiber, cotton, or polyester are effective alternatives. Do not use foam insulation.[13]\n\nIf you choose the floating ceiling joist approach (see below), install the joists before you insulate.",
                "Consider floating ceiling joists. This is the most effective decoupling method, but may not be feasible if the ceiling space is taken up by ductwork. To do this, install a new joist between each pair of ceiling joists. The new joists should extend 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) further down than the original joists.[14]\n\nIdeally, the floating joist can rest on the inside layer of a decoupled wall. This creates another air gap between the joists and the outside layer of the wall.\nIf you choose this approach, you do not need to follow the rest of the instructions. Just install more drywall over the joists, then fill in the perimeter with acoustic caulk.",
                "Purchase hat channel instead. Installing hat channel (furring channel) and sound clips is less effective than floating joists, but uses less vertical space. For best soundproofing, choose furring channel marked \"087F125-18\" or confirm that it meets these specifications: ⅞\" (22.2mm) depth; 25 gauge; hemmed long edge. Twenty gauge channel is more common, but significantly worse for soundproofing.[15]\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase resilient channel, which is designed for soundproofing. However (at least in North America), resilient channel is not standardized, so it's difficult to guarantee it will work.[16] Read customer reviews before purchasing.",
                "Install the hat channel perpendicular to the joists. Install the channels no more than 24\" (61cm) apart, and position the end channels within 6\" (15cm) of the wall. If there is a vent in your ceiling, end the channel flush against the frame of the vent on either side. Place additional short lengths of channel on either side of the vent to increase stability.[17]\n\nIf the channel is not long enough to reach across the ceiling, overlap channel lengths by at least 6\" (15cm) and screw together. Do not install sound clips onto overlapped areas.\nPlace the channels within 16\" (41cm) of each other if you plan to support a triple layer of drywall.",
                "Screw in resilient sound clips. Hat channel alone is not very effective, especially under non-dampened drywall.[18] Install soundproofing clips through the hat channel as follows:[19]\n\nPlace clips around the perimeter of the ceiling, within 6\" (15cm) of each wall.\nFill in the first channel with sound clips spaced 48\" (122cm) apart.\nFor best results, shift the next row's sound clip placement by 16\" and fill it out, spacing clips 48\" apart as before. Repeat the shift for each row. To save money (using about 10% fewer clips), arrange clips in a grid pattern instead, using the same positioning as the first channel.\nSee your clip product instructions for how to fasten. Avoid over-tightening, which can reduce soundproofing.",
                "Install drywall over the channel. Install drywall sections perpendicular to the channels for maximum strength. Fill in gaps around the perimeter with acoustic caulk.\n\n\nApplying damping compound and adding a second layer of drywall is recommended, especially if you did not reinforce the subfloor above."

        "How to Look Beautiful While Pregnant": {
            "intro": "Pregnancy changes a woman’s body in many different ways. From the pregnancy “glow” (caused by greater blood flow and more oil production in the skin) to weight gain to changes in skin and hair, pregnancy affects every woman differently.[1] However, one universal is the desire to look beautiful while pregnant. Being pregnant does not mean you have to give up your personal style or attention to your appearance.[2] There are many ways to enhance and accentuate your changing body and feel beautiful throughout all stages of your pregnancy.",
            "steps": [
                "Pay attention to your diet. Part of looking beautiful while pregnant is gaining the necessary amount of weight to properly nourish your baby. Pregnant woman should eat between 2000 and 2500 calories each day, spread throughout 4 meals.[3] Paying attention to your caloric intake will help you avoid gaining unnecessary weight that may put you at risk for certain medical conditions. You should gain the weight necessary to provide adequate nutrition for your baby and to allow him to grow to a healthy size, but you should pay close attention to gaining the appropriate amount of weight, which will keep you feeling beautiful throughout all three trimesters of your pregnancy.\n\n\nIf you have gained more weight then you planned (or more than your doctor deems healthy) you may need to lose weight. It is important to take great caution when attempting to lose weight while pregnant to ensure that your weight loss does not negatively affect your baby.",
                "Exercise consistently. If consistent exercise made you feel confident and beautiful before your pregnancy, there is no reason that pregnancy should force you to stop (although you may need to alter your workout routine). Feeling fit and strong will make you feel more confident about the way you look and will also help in getting you pre-pregnancy body back after you give birth.[4] Getting exercise during your pregnancy will help you keep your weight down, will boost your mood and energy level, and will increase your stamina and muscle strength.[5] Together, these positive results will help you to feel more beautiful.\n\n\nConsider attempting to get 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.[6] Walking, aerobics, and swimming are all great low-impact activities that you may want to try during your pregnancy. These activities will help you stay in shape and feel beautiful.\nAlways confer with your doctor before starting a workout routine when pregnant. There are certain situations, such as if you have pregnancy-related high blood pressure, in which your doctor may advise you not to exercise.[7]",
                "Drink enough water. Dehydration is a very real risk during pregnancy, and drinking enough water will help you feel healthy and look beautiful. While a person should attempt to drink roughly one-half to one ounce of water for each pound that he weighs every day, a pregnant woman must pay even more attention to her water intake.[8] Water helps form the placenta and is used in the amniotic sac in your pregnancy.[9] In addition, not drinking enough water can have a negative effect on your appearance. Dehydration can make your skin look dull, negating the beautiful glow that will accompany your pregnancy. In addition, dehydration can make you feel sluggish and ill, and it is hard to look beautiful when you are not feeling up to par.\n\n\nIt is recommended that pregnant women drink about 10 cups (or 2.3 liters) of fluids daily.[10] Drinking water for the majority of this requirement will help you avoid the sugars present in fruit drinks and sodas.",
                "Purchase some chic maternity wear. Many popular brands (think stores like Gap) and designers (look at Isabella Oliver) sell maternity clothing. While some women feel “guilty” for spending money on clothing that they will only wear for a finite amount of time, it is important to purchase clothing that fits your changing body, is comfortable to wear, and makes you feel beautiful.[11]\n\nIf you do not have the budget to purchase maternity clothing, consider asking a friend who has had a child if she has anything you might borrow for the remainder of your pregnancy. In addition, consignment clothing stores can be a great place to find maternity wear for affordable prices.\nThink about finding “staples”- clothes that can be worn and re-worn and apply to many situations. If you purchase a pair of jeans, some leggings, tank tops, and cardigans, you will find yourself able to wear these pieces over and over again.[12]\n\nChoose clothes in solid color, which look more sophisticated and are wearable in many different situations! Darker colors can often help you appear slimmer, too.",
                "Book a spa treatment or pregnancy massage. During your pregnancy, treat yourself to something that makes you feel beautiful. Whether it’s a manicure, pedicure, or facial, choose a spa treatment (or several!) that will provide a few hours to relax and enable you to walk away feeling beautiful. Alternatively, you can treat yourself to a pregnancy (or prenatal massage). Studies have shown that receiving massage therapy during pregnancy can help reduce anxiety, relieve muscle aches and joint pain, and improve labor outcomes.[13]\n\nWhen booking a prenatal massage, ensure that you find a massage therapist who is specifically certified in prenatal massage.[14]\n\nYou may also want to confer with your prenatal care provider about obtaining a prenatal massage before booking one. You should absolutely speak with your doctor if you suffer from a high-risk pregnancy.[15]",
                "Treat yourself. Your body is going through a lot of dramatic changes right now, and in addition, your life is about to change forever with the addition of your little one. That makes the time during your pregnancy a great time to treat yourself. If looking beautiful is your goal, pick something to splurge on that will make you feel as beautiful as ever.\n\n\nBook a haircut at the new fancy salon in town. Enjoy a new haircut that flatters your changing figure (which may include changes to the shape and size of your face). However, wait until at least the second trimester to schedule highlights, as there is worry that the chemicals in hair dyes can negatively affect your baby.[16]\n\nFinally buy those new earrings that you’ve been eyeing up. Use your pregnancy as a reason to buy yourself something that makes you feel beautiful. Create a positive feeling about both your inner and outer beauty that you associate with that item, and anytime you need a bit of a “pick-me-up”, use that item to remind yourself that you are beautiful.",
                "Be proud of your baby bump. One of the most important things that you can do is remember what your body is doing during pregnancy. It is growing, nourishing, and protecting another human being. All of the changes that are occurring are happening for a reason.\n\n\nTry to associate with other mothers-to-be. Surrounding yourself with other women who are also going through the physical changes associated with having a baby can boost your confidence in yourself and your body, and in doing so, make you feel beautiful. In addition, you’ll be making friends who may be sources of fun and support once your baby comes.",
                "Show off your changing body. Besides the pregnancy “glow”, your body will change in many other ways. For example, you may notice your breasts increase 1-2 cup sizes, you lose your waistline as your belly expands, and you may have swollen ankles and fast-growing fingernails.[17][18][19] One positive way to deal with these inevitable changes is to embrace and accentuate them. Once you embrace these changes, you are on your way to feeling beautiful.\n\n\nAccentuate the positive aspects of your body to feel beautiful. Look for a feature (or several features) that you feel confidence about, and accentuate it. For example, wear a sleeveless shirt if you’ve got toned arms, a V-neck sweater to show off your new cleavage, or a long flowing dress to show off a newly-rounded belly.\nIf you are struggling to be positive, remember that your pregnancy is finite. You felt beautiful before your pregnancy, and you will feel beautiful after it as well.\nIf accentuating your pregnancy isn’t for you, minimize the attention drawn to your baby bump by wearing lose garments, solid colors, and layering your clothes (for example, wear a loose denim jacket over a button down shirt). You can also draw attention elsewhere, such as by wearing a vibrant headband, a cute scarf, or bright tights.",
                "Aim to be good enough. Don’t worry about having the perfect shape or living up to the ideals you see in pregnancy magazines. Instead, focus on being healthy and happy in both body and spirit. You won’t know how your body will respond to pregnancy until you are actually pregnant.[20] Try to give up the ideal image you may have had in your mind, and appreciate your body for what it is and for what it’s doing. Keep a positive attitude- this will help you feel beautiful.\n\n\nFocus on the big picture. Your body isn’t changing because you’ve given up on taking care of yourself, your body is changing in order to help your baby come into this world as healthy and prepared as he can be.[21]"

Use a spoon to skim it away before simmering the mixture.",
                "Place the pork belly on a rack, salt, and refrigerate. After the pork belly has cooked for an hour or so, allow it cool until you can handle it. Transfer it to a wire rack that’s been fitted over a rimmed baking sheet. Season the pork liberally with Kosher salt, making sure to cover both sides. Place the pork belly in the refrigerator for 6 hours to overnight, or until the skin is completely dried.[11]\n\nWipe the pork belly dry before seasoning it with the salt.",
                "Cut the pork belly into slices. After the pork belly has dried, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to cut it into ¾-inch (1.9-cm) slices. Place the slices on a plate near the stove, so they’re nearby when you start frying.[12]",
                "Add the oil to a Dutch oven or wok and heat. Place a Dutch oven or wok on the stove, and add 4-inches (10-cm) of canola or peanut oil. Turn the heat to medium-high, and heat the oil until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).[13]\n\nUse a deep frying thermometer to monitor the oil so you know when it’s reached the right temperature.",
                "Fry the pork belly in batches until it is dark brown. Add the sliced pork belly to the hot oil in batches, frying the pieces until they turn a dark brown and the skin becomes crispy. It should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes.[14]\n\nMake sure to flip the pork belly slices halfway through the cooking to ensure that both sides are crispy.",
                "Place the pork on paper towel-lined plate and season with salt and pepper. When the pork belly is fried to a golden brown, use tongs to remove the pieces from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Season the pork with salt and pepper to taste while it’s still hot.[15]",
                "Cut the pork, and serve with the sauce. When the pork has cooled slightly, use a knife to cut it into ½-inch (1.3-cm) pieces. Set them on a serving platter, and serve with the lechon sauce for dipping.[16]"

        "wikiHow to Make Wine Bottle Accent Lights": {
            "intro": "Everyone has seen white christmas lights adorning walls, adding a delicate touch of accent lighting to any area, but did you know you can make accent lights using empty wine bottles? Making your own wine bottle accent lights is a creative, customizable, and eco-friendly way to cast a gentle glow to any room of your house.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather your wine bottles. The wine bottles you use can be different shapes, and sizes, but try to choose bottles that have distinctive, fun labels. You can choose to keep the labels on bottles, or you can remove the labels.",
                "Clean the wine bottles. Wash your bottles thoroughly with hot, soapy water and allow the bottles to dry completely. The hot, soapy water might cause the labels to peel off from the bottles. You can leave the labels on the bottles if you prefer, or peel them off for a sleeker look.\n\n\nIf you decide to take the labels off the bottles, make sure to remove the label glue with some adhesive eliminating spray.[1]",
                "Build a jig. While you wait for the wine bottles to dry, build a base (jig) where you can place the bottle, and hold it steady while you drill. Use a 2x8 piece of wood, and lay it lengthwise on a flat surface. Screw in a 12 inch (30.5 cm) piece of wood about a quarter of the way from the edge of the 2x8. This piece of wood is going to be used as a parting stop.[2] Lay a bottle on the 2x8 piece of wood against the first piece of parting stop, and place another parting stop on the other side of the bottle. Hold that parting stop in place and take away the bottle. Then scoot the parting stop in a little bit closer to the already attached parting stop. Drill the second piece of parting stop like you did the first piece.[3]\n\nThe idea behind the jig is to hold the bottle securely, so it doesn’t roll away as you’re drilling into it.",
                "Drill a hole for the bottle stopper. Drill a hold in the center of the jig base to hold the bottle stopper. You want your hole to be able 1.25 inches deep. To get the right drill hole, consider using the Forstner drill bit.[4] You want the hole to be deep tight enough so the stopper stays still as you drill it, but loose enough so you can easily remove the bottle stopper.\n\n\nThis stopper will be used later to keep the string of lights secured in the bottle.",
                "Drill the stopper. Insert the stopper into the hole in the middle of the jig. Attach the 5/16 inch drill bit into the drill. Center the bit on the stopper, turn on the drill press, and drill through the stopper.[5] You want to drill a hole completely through the stopper. When you are finished drilling, you will most likely have to twist off the stopper from the drill bit.\n\n\nDon’t try to drill the stopper without the jig holding it in place. You will most definitely hurt yourself trying to drill it by holding it with your hands.",
                "Cut the stopper. Pull the stopper from the jig, and use a box knife to slice the stopper from the top of the hole to the bottom, with the point of the knife right inside the stopper hole.\n\n\nThe cut makes sure that once we are ready to secure the cord of lights, the lights can slide in the opening and be tightly secured by the stopper.",
                "Mark your drilling spot on the bottle. Look to drill somewhere on the back of the bottle near the bottom.\n\n\nConsider applying a piece of masking tape to the spot you plan to drill. The tape will help keep the drill from slipping and help to prevent the glass bottle from splintering near the drill site.[6]",
                "Make a lubricating water reservoir. Roll a piece of clay into a rope approximately 4 inches long and about ½ inch in width. Then connect the ends of the clay to form a circle. This circle will serve as a little water reservoir to lubricate the drilling hole and glass as you drill. Surround the area you decided to drill with the clay, and press it into the bottle to seal the reservoir.\n\n\nYou might also consider making a pocket (a thick pancake shape) of plumber’s clay, and drilling through the clay you drill. If you decide to drill this way, you must slowly pour water onto the bottle as you drill your hole so the drill doesn’t over heat the bottle and cause it to splinter and crack.",
                "Prepare the drill lubricant. Fill up a squeeze bottle with some cold tap water. Squirt some water into the clay water reservoir. This cold water mitigates the heat created from drilling the glass. If any water starts to leak out from the water reservoir, seal it by pushing the clay harder onto the bottle.[7]\n\nYou will have to consistently pause drilling, add water to the reservoir, and continue on with the drilling process.",
                "Drill the hole in the bottle. Before you start drilling, put on your protective gloves and glasses. It’s also advisable to wear long sleeve shirts when drilling glass. Use a hand drill with a ½ inch diamond bit, or glass and tile bit, to drill your hole. Place the bottle onto the jig so it stays put while you drill the hole. Hold the drill vertically straight, and start the drill. Lower the drill until it just barely comes in contact with the surface of the bottle. As you start cutting the glass, glass dust will dust up the water reservoir, making it cloudy. Continue drilling, pushing down ever so slight onto the drill.\n\nEventually (after about 20 or 30 seconds), the water in the reservoir will start to leak and drip into the inside of the bottle. This means that you are almost completely broken through the glass. Once you have drilled through the bottle, pull the drill out from the hole and turn off the drill.[8].\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Make Wine Bottle Accent Lights Step 10\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a8/Make-Wine-Bottle-Accent-Lights-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid3659957-v4-728px-Make-Wine-Bottle-Accent-Lights-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nIt is very important that you don't force the drill through the glass. Too much downward pressure could make the bottle to crack.",
                "Check your drilling work. Look around the drill site for fractures in the bottle. If you see any cracks, you might want to discard the bottle, as it will be very fragile and potentially dangerous. Remove the clay lubricant reservoir and empty the contents of the bottle into the garbage.\n\n\nIf the drilled out glass disc isn’t in the bottle, it’s probably stuck in the drill bit. If that’s the case, try to pry it out with a paperclip edge.",
                "Sand the drilled hole. Use sandpaper to file down the sharp edges created by drilling the hole into the bottle. Then rinse the bottle with water to wash out any glass bits, and allow the bottle to dry again.\n\n\n150 grit paper will sufficiently smooth out the rough edges of the hole.",
                "Insert the lights into the bottle. Remove the decoration lights from the box, and pull the lights taut so they can lay straight. Check to make sure the string of lights work by plugging them into an outlet.[9] If the lights light up and are working correctly, insert the first bulb on the string in through the hole that you drilled out. Continue inserting the lights one by one, being sure to keep the outlet plug remaining outside the bottle. To help fit the light bulbs through the hole more easily, push the light against the cord, and push both through at the same time.\n\n\nBe careful not to cut the lights cord on the edges of the hole.\nYou might have to turn the bottle upside down in order to move the lights inside the bottom “up” to make room for the rest of the lights entering through the base of the bottle.",
                "Secure the lights with a stopper. Once you’ve finished feeding the lights into the bottle, wrap the stopper around the remaining strand hanging from the outside of the bottle, and insert the stopper into the hole.[10]\n\nThe stopper will protect the cord from being cut by the raw glass edges of the hole and keep the lights inside the bottle.",

        "How to Get to Sleep and Feel Refreshed in the Morning": {
            "intro": "When you come home from a long day at work, you are likely exhausted. However, even if you get plenty of sleep, you may find yourself groggy in the morning. Knowing how to shed your worries, unwind at night, and sleep deeply and soundly will help you feel energized and ready to go in the morning.",
            "steps": [
                "Get comfortable. Don't wear any clothes that are too tight or restricting or that will keep you too warm at night. They can keep you from falling asleep because you aren't comfortable, as well as make you restless later. One study even found that wearing tight clothing at night suppresses the release of melatonin, which is necessary for falling and staying asleep.[1]",
                "Cut out stimulants. Caffeine can interfere with your sleep even if it has been six hours since you last had any, so make sure to stop drinking it early.[2] Another stimulant to avoid is nicotine; it's best to try to quit smoking and using all other nicotine containing products (vaporizing nicotine, chewing tobacco, patches, and gum) altogether if you are having trouble sleeping.[3]\n\nKeep in mind that you may have a period of withdrawal as you are cutting out nicotine, and this may interfere with your sleep.[4] Be sure to discuss any issues you are having with your doctor.",
                "Turn off the electronics. At least an hour before you want to sleep, turn off your computer, phone, and television. The bright lights of the screen tell your brain to stay awake, so to get your mind ready for bed, they need to go.[5] The blue light from screens is especially responsible for causing sleep disturbances.[6]",
                "Stop your racing mind. If you find you can't sleep because your brain keeps going, stop trying to sleep. Go try another activity for a time, such as reading a book. You'll begin to feel sleepy, and when you do, return to bed. This practice helps you to associate your bed with one thing--sleep.[7]\n\nAnother way to slow down your mind is to try meditation, as it clears your mind of thoughts if you do it properly. It also relaxes you, helps to regulate your sleep, go through more REM cycles, and sleep better overall.[8]One simple meditation is to concentrate on your breaths. Take deep breaths in and out, focusing solely on your breaths.[9] Try counting to four each time you inhale, and then repeat four counts each time you exhale to help slow your breaths. You can also use a guided meditation app to help you learn how to meditate.\nAlso, have a pen handy. That way, if you think of something you must do tomorrow, you can write it down instead of worrying about it.[10]",
                "Keep snacks light before bed. Big meals can cause indigestion or make you full enough that it keeps you awake. If you need a snack before bed, keep it light and have it at least 45 minutes before bed.[11][12]\n\nEating too much sugar, saturated fat, and not enough fiber can interfere with your sleep, so try to stick to a low sugar, low-saturated fat, and high fiber diet.[13]",
                "Stay on schedule. Try going to sleep at the same time every night, as well as waking up at the same time every morning. This trains your body to want to go to bed when it's time for you to go to bed, helping you get to sleep easier.[14]",
                "Try melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that tells you to sleep. Your body already produces it, but you can also take a supplement. It is relatively safe, though it can cause headaches, dizziness, and irritability, as well as make you drowsy the next day. Therefore, you should try it out on a weekend when you don't need to be anywhere in particular.\n\n\nOrally, you can swallow a pill or buy lozenges that you leave to melt under your tongue. You can also use a cream that you rub into your skin.[15] Usually, you take 0.3 to 0.5 milligrams near bedtime to help you get to sleep. The body generally produces 0.3 milligrams or less per day, so you can start with less than that (0.1 milligrams) and work your way up to a dose that helps you, up to 3 milligrams as an adult.[16] However, keep in mind that more melatonin is not necessarily better. You may want to try a time release melatonin supplement if you have trouble staying asleep.[17]\n\nMelatonin can react with other medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and blood pressure medications. Always check with your doctor first before starting a new supplement or over-the-counter medication.[18]",
                "Try a sleep aid. Over-the-counter medications can help you sleep. Most are antihistamines that make you drowsy. However, if you take them too often, they won't be effective anymore and may have long-term side-effects, such as dementia.[19] Plus, they can make you groggy the next day.[20]\n\nThe two main categories are diphenhydramine, which is the main ingredient in Benadryl and Unisom SleepGels, and doxylamine succinate, the main ingredient in Unisom SleepTabs. Both of these are antihistamines that can make you drowsy in the day, give you blurred vision, and dry out your mouth.[21]\n\nAlways check with your doctor first. You shouldn't take these drugs if you have certain conditions, such as liver disease, asthma, glaucoma, or sleep apnea.[22]",
                "Understand when to see a doctor. If you're getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night, and still not feeling ok in the morning, you may need to see a doctor. You could have a sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, or primary insomnia.[23]\n\nInsomnia is a chronic condition where you can't go to sleep or you wake up often during the night.[24] Sleep apnea keeps you from getting restful sleep because you stop breathing while you are sleeping. Restless legs syndrome is a tingling feeling in your legs that can keep you awake. Narcolepsy can cause you to fall asleep at almost any time against your control.[25] Narcolepsy can also affect your sleep at night, such as by causing insomnia, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness, and bringing about a sudden need for sleep.[26]",
                "Skip the alcohol late at night. Though alcohol can help you fall asleep, it can also make you restless later at night, meaning you won't wake up as refreshed.[27] Stop drinking at least 2 hours before bedtime.[28]\n\nAlcohol diminishes your ability to go into REM sleep, so you get less good quality sleep. Also, if you drink too much, it can affect your breathing, making your sleep not as sound.[29]",
                "Take your pets out of the bedroom. Your pets most likely do not sleep through the night like you do. They move around, make noise, and get up. These activities can wake you up, leaving you less rested. Try locking your pets out of your room for a night to see if you sleep better.[30]",
                "Drown out the light. Light tells your brain to wake up, so whether it's light from streetlights, the hallway, or even your bedside clock, it can keep you up. Blue light emitted by electronics like your TV, computer, and smartphone can also raise your cortisol levels and cause major sleep disturbances.[31] Use dark curtains on the window, especially if you have a good amount of early morning light, and place towels under doors if you need to do so. Cover up your clock so it's not shining so brightly.[32]",
                "Cool down your room. In the same vein, your room should be cool enough for sleeping, as you'll toss and turn if you're too warm. Generally, you should aim for 65 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.[33]\n\nStudies show that people sleep better and for longer periods of time in colder rooms. In fact, studies have shown that a cool room can even help people who suffer from sleep apnea sleep better. Your body follows circadian rhythms when it comes temperature, cooling down as you get closer to nighttime. However, if your body runs a bit hotter overall, you may have trouble falling asleep if you're not in a cool room, as your body can't cool down for sleep.[34]\n\nBe aware that temperature above 75 degrees or below 54 degrees can make it harder for you to sleep.[35][36]",
                "Remove noise from the room. That is, you should definitely turn off noises such as the television and radio, but you should also take out anything smaller that makes noise, such as a ticking clock. Even small sounds can keep you awake or wake you up.[37]\n\nIf you can't stop certain noises, try earplugs or a white noise app to drown them out.[38]",
                "Change positions. Just because you've slept on your back your whole life doesn't mean that's the best position for you. Try sleeping on your side, or if you must stay on your back, maybe you need to support your knees and back with pillows to help keep you comfortable throughout the night.[39][40]",
                "Try a gentle alarm clock. Your body doesn't like to be jolted out of sleep, and you may feel more groggy if you have a loud, obnoxious alarm clock. Try one that has a more gradual alarm, such as one that slowly gets louder.[41]\n\nTry using an alarm app that will wake you up slowly.[42]",
                "Be in the sunlight. As soon as you can in the morning, try to get some sunlight. Either step outside or let sunlight into your bedroom Sunlight tells your body to wake up, so you'll be awake to start the day.[43]\n\nYour body's natural rhythms are set by the sun and night. Basically, the sunlight tells your body it's morning, and it's time to start the day.[44]",
                "Drink water. You lose water during the night from sweating and through breathing. Make it one of your top priorities to drink a glass of water early in the morning, prepping you for the rest of the day.[45]",
                "Have some coffee. Though you want to skip the caffeine later in the day, you can use some in the morning to get you going. Just don't go overboard; 1 to 2 cups is sufficient. Try programming your coffeepot to start brewing just before your alarm. The smell will help you wake up, plus you'll have coffee ready to go.[46]",
                "Give yourself energy. Just like your car needs gas to go, your body needs food to go. Give it what it needs by having a breakfast complete with protein and a complex carbohydrate, such as peanut butter on whole wheat toast. Skip overly sugary breakfasts, such as sugary cereals or waffles with syrup.[47] However, keep in mind that sugar can hide in all kinds of foods. For example, some studies have shown that bread, including whole wheat bread, may increase your blood sugar as much as eating two tablespoons of sugar.[48] Check the ingredients list on anything you eat to be sure.\n\n\nTry oatmeal, which is packed with fiber and is a complex carbohydrate. Use fruit to sweeten it, and add some protein, such as a few almonds or peanuts.[49]\n\nEat Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt has more protein than other yogurts, so it's a great choice for the mornings. Try it plain with some fruit to add sweetness.[50]",
                "Try exercise. Nothing wakes you up like a morning workout, so try jogging or an aerobic routine in the morning to get your day going. As an added bonus, people who exercise tend to sleep better at night, so you'll have a more restful night later.[51]\n\nAvoid doing anything too strenuous in the evening hours because this may keep you up at night.[52]"

            "intro": "Rowing machines are very useful as workout tools when used properly. Rowing machines allow you to strengthen your core, legs, arm, and back muscles; however, in order to have an effective workout, you need to use the rowing machine correctly. Moving your body in the correct sequence is vital for a successful and safe workout on a rowing machine.",
            "steps": [
                "Lock your feet into the straps. Before you begin, make sure your feet are secured to the foot plate. To do so, use the straps provided on the machine.[1]\n\nPull the straps across the top of your foot. Secure them until they're tight to the point your feet do not slide around on the foot plate.",
                "Get into the starting position. The starting position for rowing is known as \"the catch.\" To get into the catch, bend your knees until your body is near the handle at the front of the machine. Grab the handle securely with both hands. Make sure your back is straight.[2]\n\nHinge forward at the hips so the torso is tilted in a forward leaning position over your legs. Keep your back as straight as you can.\nMake sure to grab the handle firmly. You do not want it to slide out of your hands while you are rowing.",
                "Push off the foot plate with your leg muscles. When using a rowing machine, you're moving one body part at a time — start with the legs.[3] When you push off the foot plate, you will be using your quads and glutes to extend your legs.\n\nDo not make the mistake of using your full-body all at once during this exercise. Rowing properly means you are progressing from using your legs, then your core, then your arms in succession — not all at once in a single full-body move.\nThe muscles used for a rowing machine should be 60% legs, 20% core, and 20% arms/shoulders.\nKeep your arms and torso in the original position.",
                "Lean back into a 45 degree angle. Once your legs are straightened out, use your core and hamstrings to lean back to a roughly 45 degree angle, keeping your spine straight.\n\n\nYour core muscles keep the pelvis and upper torso locked together — this will stabilize your back, preventing movement along the spine which could lead to injury.",
                "Practice arm isolations. Once your legs are straight and your back is tilted, you can practice including the arm movements. Your core will remain engaged, holding your torso at a 45 degree angle as you pull the handle toward your chest.\n\nBend your elbows in order to pull the handle towards your chest.\nPull the handle inward until it touches just below your chest.\nThis move will cause your latissimus dorsi to contract to stabilize the shoulder, the deltoids and triceps contract to pull the elbow back and the handle towards the sternum.",
                "Extend your arms while reaching your torso forward. You will now begin to return to starting position, following the reverse sequence of movement — arms, core, legs. Extend your arms from your chest, then tilt your torso forward out of the 45 degree angle.[4]\n\nExtend your arms first and then hinge your torso forward at the hips.",
                "Bend your knees to return to the starting position. Keep bending your knees until you're back in the original position. You should have your knees bent and your body close to the front of the machine, with your hands firmly grasped around the handle. You can now do the movement again.[5]\n\nKeep in mind that the movement is not a two count movement — one count out, one count in. Rowing properly is a three count movement, with one power-driven count as you extend your body out with the stroke. Returning to the catch should take two counts, which gives you time to recover for your next pull.[6]",
                "Start at the right setting. If you work out at a gym, the rowing machine may be set to a very high or low setting when you're starting out. Make sure to check the settings before you begin rowing. If you've never rowed before, you do not want to start out on a very high setting.[7]\n\nThe higher the gear, the heavier the machine will feel as you move your body back and forth.\nFor beginners, a setting between three and five is recommended.",
                "Engage the right muscles when rowing. Many people use the rowing machine to work their arms; however, you're better off using something like free weights if you're just looking for an arm workout. Remember, the rowing machine engages your legs, core, and arms. Use all these muscle groups when rowing instead of just using your arms.[8]\n\nConcentrate mostly on your legs when moving your body back and forth on the rowing machine. Again, about 60% of your body's movement should come from your legs.\nOnly about 20% of your body's movement comes from your arms. The other 20% should come from your core.",
                "Do not move your arms and legs at the same time. Remember that there is a specific order that you should move your body on a rowing machine. You start with your legs, then move onto your core and hamstrings, and finish with your arms and back. Make sure to row in order instead of moving your legs, arms, and core at the same time.[9]",
                "Keep your back straight. If you hunch while rowing, you'll end up with a sore back later. Be aware of your posture through the entire rowing process. Make sure to keep your back as straight as possible during every step of the rowing movement.[10]"

In addition to teaching you about the purpose of this essential business tool, this article will help you plan and design your marketing calendar.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn about the purpose of a marketing calendar. Before you can start creating an effective marketing calendar, you need to make sure you understand the purpose behind this essential business tool. A marketing calendar is a plan that details your specific marketing activities for the upcoming calendar year.[1][2][3]\n\nThink of it as your marketing blueprint that will precisely identify how your company or firm will convey its message or sell its services and products to the targeted audience. It charts how and when you plan to distribute your content, messages, services, or products.",
                "Understand the benefits of a great marketing calendar. In order to create an awesome marketing calendar, it is helpful to understand why it is worth spending your time and energy on this exercise. Here are some of the main benefits of creating a well-designed marketing calendar:[4][5][6]\n\nIt will expand the reach of your business and increase your company’s visibility.\nIt will help you budget your resources.\nIt will help ensure that your products or brand reach the intended audience.\nIt will help separate your company or product from the competition.\nIt will save your company time and money while making the marketing process less stressful.\nIt will help you set deadlines and keep employees on track.",
                "Recognize what a marketing calendar should include. To be as effective as possible, the marketing calendar should identify exactly how and when you plan to market your goods or services using a range of mediums including: print materials, email blasts, social media, blogging dates, press releases, events, promotions, online ads, videos or podcasts, etc. Although you might not have all the details worked out when you first get started creating the calendar, here are a few other important points you should try to include for each entry in the calendar:[7][8]\n\nTitle or name of the project, event, or promotion.\nThe date you set.\nThe name and contact information for the person assigned to manage this specific project.\nA list of other employees, contractors, or individuals that will assist with the project, and details on what their roles will be.\nSpace to make notes about how effective the marketing campaign was and what should be improved. Being able to attach or include supplemental reports and data can be invaluable.",
                "Invest the time and resources to plan your marketing calendar. Although it might seem overwhelming at first, it’s important to invest the time and resources into carefully developing your marketing calendar. Your efforts will pay off when your marketing is done ahead of schedule and you can spend your time working on other aspects of your business.[9]",
                "Re-use your marketing calendar next year. In the future, you will be able to update your marketing calendar and re-use it, so you won't be starting from scratch the following year when you have to plan out your marketing strategy and set these dates. If you’ve carefully updated your existing calendar and made notes on the effectiveness and success rate of different marketing strategies, it will be much easier to adapt and refine your existing calendar for the following year.",
                "Take note of your budget. Your budget will have a significant influence on how you market your products, content, or services. It’s a good idea to take hard look at your budget before creating your marketing calendar so you can make sure you are not planning events, promotions, and advertising that you will not be able to support.[10]\n\nWhen you are familiar with your budget, you can better space out the events on your marketing calendar and make sure your plans don’t exceed your available resources.",
                "Review your annual marketing plan if available. Creating a marketing calendar will be much easier if you review the annual marketing plan your company or business has in place. Most large companies and many small companies have an annual marketing plan, which outlines marketing strategies that will be used throughout the year.\n\n\nAlthough the strategies may change, this plan should state the intentions of the company to communicate with customers, increase market share, and produce marketing content.\nUsing an existing marketing plan will make creating your marketing calendar much easier, and help you organize and fill it in.\nIf you do not have a marketing plan, you can still create an effective marketing calendar. It might just take a little more time and effort to develop.",
                "List your marketing strategies. Make a list of the marketing strategies you or your company plans to employ. Include all aspects of your marketing effort, such as emails, articles, social media posts, advertisements, video or podcasts, press releases, partnerships, and affiliate marketing.[11]\n\nThis list will help you when you start filling in your marketing calendar and need to make sure you are setting up the most effective marketing strategy for a specific event.\nMake a note of who is responsible for each marketing effort so that this information will be included on the calendar.",
                "Be aware of your intended audience. Your overall marketing and the marketing calendar won't be very effective or targeted if you aren’t sure about the intended audience or demographic you hope to reach. For each event you create on the calendar, you should be able to identify the customer you hope to appeal to.[12]",
                "Locate a calendar or something you can use to outline a draft. Before you begin creating a more detailed marketing calendar, it will be helpful to have something you can use to take notes on and start outlining your ideas.\n\n\nYou can print out a free monthly calendar online, map this out on a dry-erase board, or type it into a spreadsheet or document. Use whatever you feel comfortable with since this will really just be a rough draft of your marketing calendar.",
                "Mark holidays, vacation times, and days off. While it might seem challenging to get started, filling in the holidays, vacation times, days off, and other established dates or events will help you get started and think about when you might be able to schedule key marketing events.",
                "Research the traditional marketing cycles in your industry. Most industries have peak periods or seasons where they market their products more aggressively or successfully. Do a little research to identify the key months when your competitors market similar products or services.[13]\n\nFor example, if you are marketing a moving company, the peak periods for this industry are often in the spring and summer when people are relocating, so you will probably want to increase your marketing during these periods.\nSimilarly, if you sell health and wellness products, many people purchase these items in January at the beginning of the New Year, and you can adjust your marketing level accordingly.",
                "Think about monthly themes in the traditional marketing cycle. Based on holidays, seasonal changes, school calendars, sporting events, and pop culture events, think about monthly themes that might help you develop specific sales, events, promotions, etc. The basic calendar breakdown below should help you get started: [14][15]\n\nJanuary: New Year’s Day, resolutions, health, wellness, and organization.\nFebruary: Valentine’s Day, and African American history month, Valentine’s Day.\nMarch: spring gardening, St. Patrick’s Day, women’s history month.\nApril: Earth Day, dieting and wellness before summer.\nMay: Cinco de Mayo and Mother’s Day.\nJune: graduation season, Father’s Day, summer vacations.\nJuly: summer, family reunions, 4th of July, outdoor cooking, and entertaining.\nAugust: back to school and the end of summer.\nSeptember: back to school, organization, sporting events, and parenting.\nOctober: fall activities, Halloween, breast cancer month, and political campaigns.\nNovember: Thanksgiving, pre-holiday shopping.\nDecember: holiday promotions and year-end sales.",
                "Develop marketing events based on these themes. Now that you’ve considered these monthly themes, it’s time to start brainstorming about potential events, deals, sales, and promotions that you think will be successful. To make your planning more effective and so you are not starting from scratch, think about these questions:[16]\n\nHave you pulled off successful events in the past? If so, include them again on the calendar and make some notes about why you think they were successful. Also, start assembling the past promotional materials so you can use these again or easily update them.\nAre there marketing activities that were not totally successful, but could be improved or tweaked to get better results? This is helpful because you don’t have to start from scratch and can refine your existing approach to get better results.\nWhat has not worked in the past? If you’ve had unsuccessful activities or marketing strategies in the past, and don’t think they can be improved upon, you’re probably better off leaving these out of the calendar.",
                "Consider special quarterly marketing opportunities. Although you've probably already come up with a lot of potential ideas based on your industry cycle and monthly themes, some experts also recommend designing a special marketing opportunity for each quarter.[17]\n\nFor example, you could offer a deal to people who sign up for your mailing list, or disseminate a special discount only through social media.",
                "Choose a format for your calendar. There are many different tools you can use to create your marketing calendar, and ultimately you should select a format that works best for you, your employees, and the specific needs of your business. Here are a few things to consider when selecting a format:\n\n\nResearch free online calendar options through Google, Microsoft, or other companies that offer email platforms so you can easily send out announcements or updates. These programs can also set up reminders and recurring events, which can be very helpful with your marketing calendar.\nYou can also format the calendar as a spreadsheet, which would allow you to see more information at one time, but spreadsheets can be more difficult and clunky than an online calendar program.\nYou can also consider hiring a company that develops a marketing calendar to suit your needs.",
                "Assign someone to oversee the marketing calendar. This person should create the calendar and be the contact for adding, updating, or removing events. An ideal candidate is someone who is organized and proficient using the program your calendar is created with.\n\n\nAn important part of their job will be compiling information and making notes about what worked and what didn’t.",
                "Be flexible and make changes as needed. A marketing calendar is designed to be a working document that you can make changes to, so be flexible and make adjustments as needed.[18]",
                "Keep good records. One of the essential components of a marketing calendar is preserving a record of your results. The more detailed information you provide on how successful your events, promotions, or efforts were, the better prepared you will be to refine your marketing strategies so you can reach new customers.[19]",
                "Sign into a Google account.

        "How to Use Rubbing Alcohol": {
            "intro": "Rubbing alcohol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, is a tremendously useful agent. It can be used as an antiseptic, a cleaning agent, and even as a survival tool. Rubbing alcohol is not safe for consumption, and anyone who accidentally ingests rubbing alcohol should seek immediate medical attention.[1] Knowing how to safely use rubbing alcohol in your home can help you treat wounds and keep a cleaner home.",
            "steps": [
                "Clean your hands with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is a common ingredient in most commercial hand sanitizers. Hand sanitizer is used to disinfect the hands, and does not require soap or water. Simply rubbing hand sanitizer on the hands for approximately 30 seconds, or until the liquid has evaporated, kills the majority of bacteria present. Hand sanitizer often includes additional components, such as a moisturizing element to prevent the hands from drying out, but these components are not necessary. If you are unable to wash your hands with soap and water, or if you want to ensure that your hands are completely clean, rubbing alcohol may be used to disinfect the hands.[2]\n\nPour a small amount of rubbing alcohol into the palm of one hand.\nRub the hands together vigorously for approximately 30 seconds, or until the hands are completely covered and the alcohol begins to evaporate.[3]\n\nNote that rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer do not remove dirt from the hands. If your hands are visibly soiled, you may need to wash your hands with soap and water to remove the dirt from your skin.[4]",
                "Treat wounds with rubbing alcohol. One of the most common uses of rubbing alcohol is treating wounds. This is because rubbing alcohol makes an excellent antiseptic. It kills germs by coagulating each germ's protein. Once a germ's protein is solidified, the germ dies rather quickly.[5]\n\nPour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the skin surrounding a wound. This may be particularly helpful for puncture wounds, which can introduce foreign germs into the wound.[6] Once the wound is clean, you can bandage the wound, and seek medical attention as needed.",
                "Disinfect skin before an injection. Certain medications, like insulin, need to be injected into the body. Prior to administering an injection, it's important to disinfect the skin to prevent bacteria from being introduced into the body.[7]\n\nPour 60% to 70% rubbing alcohol onto a clean cotton swab.[8]\n\nThoroughly wipe the skin where the injection will be administered. Do not go over the same area twice.[9]\n\nWait for the alcohol to completely dry before administering the injection.[10]",
                "Disinfect medical tools. Some household medical tools, like tweezers, can harbor bacteria that could be introduced to a wound. For this reason, it's important to disinfect medical tools before use. You can do this with rubbing alcohol.[11]\n\nThoroughly douse the tips of tweezers in rubbing alcohol. Allow the alcohol to dry before use, to ensure that any bacteria on the tweezers have been killed.[12]",
                "Remove stains with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol can make a surprisingly effective stain remover. Simply mix one part rubbing alcohol with two parts water. You can use this mixture in a spray bottle, or poured on a rag or towel to spot clean stained fabrics.[13]\n\nRubbing alcohol can be used to treat grass stains before the wash cycle. Apply the rubbing alcohol mixture to a stain, rubbing the fabric thoroughly. Let it sit for ten minutes, then wash the clothing article as you normally would.[14]",
                "Clean your bathroom with rubbing alcohol. Because of its antiseptic properties, rubbing alcohol is often used to clean high-germ areas like bathrooms. Apply rubbing alcohol to a paper towel and rub bathroom fixtures like faucets, sinks, and toilets to quickly clean and disinfect these surfaces.[15]",
                "Make a window cleaner with rubbing alcohol. In addition to its other cleaning applications, rubbing alcohol can be used to make an effective window cleaner. Just mix one pint of rubbing alcohol with two tablespoons of ammonia and two tablespoons of dish soap. Mix the formula thoroughly, then apply to windows using a spray bottle or sponge.[16]",
                "Remove a tick. Some people find that applying rubbing alcohol to a burrowed tick can shock the tick, making it easier to remove. Even if this does not work, experts recommend using rubbing alcohol to kill and preserve a tick after removal. This makes it easier for doctors to determine if the tick was a carrier of Lyme disease.[17]\n\nUse a clean cotton swab to apply rubbing alcohol to the area where a tick is attached. If you don't have cotton swabs, you can pour a little rubbing alcohol directly onto the skin.[18]\n\nUse clean tweezers (preferably after sterilizing them, which you can do with rubbing alcohol) to grip the tick's body as close to the surface of your skin as possible.[19]\n\nGently pull the tick upward without breaking any part of the tick's body.[20]\n\nDrop the tick into a jar or bottle filled with a little rubbing alcohol. Be sure the tick is completely submerged.[21]\n\nUse rubbing alcohol to cleanse the skin's surface where the tick was removed.[22]",
                "Get rid of sneaker odors. Use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol to the inside of sneakers. The rubbing alcohol will kill the bacteria causing the smells, leaving your sneakers clean and odor-free.[23]",
                "Remove nail polish. If you're out of nail polish remover, you can use rubbing alcohol in a pinch. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab, and rub hard on your finger nails to remove old nail polish. Nail polish won't come off as easily as with actual nail polish remover, but it will still strip away the old nail polish.[24]",
                "Do not use rubbing alcohol to cool feverish skin. A common folk remedy for fevers is to apply rubbing alcohol to the skin. As the alcohol evaporates, it's thought to offer a cooling sensation.[25] However, pouring rubbing alcohol on the body, especially on children, can be extremely dangerous. A number of children have actually slipped into comas after their parents applied rubbing alcohol to treat a fever. For this reason, using rubbing alcohol to relieve the symptoms of a fever is highly discouraged.[26]"

        "wikiHow to Become a Song Writer": {
            "intro": "Becoming a songwriter is a lifelong dream for many. Although anyone can technically write a song, only a small portion of people end up make a living off their passion. Writing good songs is a major part of being a songwriter, but it doesn't stop there. If you want to make the leap, you'll need to market your songs once they're polished up. Songwriting can be a harrowing field to get into, and it's extremely competitive. However, with the right dedication and artistic integrity, there just might be a place for you in this field.",
            "steps": [
                "Begin with a chord progression.[1] A chord progression is the basis of any pop song. Chord progressions are fundamentally simple to come up with, but it requires inspiration to come up with a truly great one. Using an instrument of your choice, play around with a few different chords and see how they match up together.\n\n\nChord progressions are often predictable and simple in the context of pop music. Especially if you are starting out as a songwriter, it's a good idea to start small at first and work from there.",
                "Build a song structure.[2] A hit song will always come in the form of a coherent song structure. It may be helpful to write out the parts of your song down, and attach musical ideas to them as they come. Here is a list of some common parts in songs:\n\n\nThe intro: An instrumental opening for the song that introduces the tone and rhythm of the song. Certain songs, like the Beatles' \"She Loves You\" break typical form and open up the song with the melodic chorus.\nThe verse: The most common part of a song, where the main body of the lyrics and music tends to go. In Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" and others, this is where the story is told. The \"summary\" of the song is reserved for the chorus.\nThe chorus: A repeated section, often the most memorable melody in the song. Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" uses two verses before its chorus. The chorus uses repetitive lyrics stating the speaker's summary of the action.\nThe bridge: A change of pace featured later on in the song, often following a chorus. If a fresh idea happens right before a chorus, it may be called a pre-chorus. \"Billie Jean\" uses a pre-chorus after the verse and before the chorus. This is used to build up the tension before letting loose in the song's melodic hook.",
                "Practice your instrument daily. If you play an instrument, noodling around on it every day may lead to surprising new insights and ideas. Give yourself some time to play in a freeform mode on your instrument. Let all pretenses drop, play around and see what happens. If you end up hearing an idea you like, write it down or record it for use on a song.\n\n\nPracticing and rehearsing songs written by other people can be the springboard for your own creative ideas.[3]",
                "Record a demo.[4] After you have a basic demo prepared, you can revisit it and listen for yourself. This will shed a fresh insight on the music and what it may need. Improve upon the demo version as you see fit. Because songwriting is a constantly evolving process, you may record several demos of the same song before you're done.",
                "Verse yourself in music theory.[5] Although being educated in music theory isn't necessary for a songwriter by any means, it may help set you on the right track. Knowing which notes tend to agree with each other the most may give you a valuable insight if you're stuck on a certain part of a song and aren't sure how to proceed.\n\n\nTheory books are widely available.\nCommunity colleges also often host classes in music theory.",
                "Keep an ideas notebook. The best lyric writers take a notebook around with them wherever they go. That way, when a clever line strikes them, they can record it down before it's lost forever. Make a habit of writing down the random thoughts that come into your head on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\nKeeping a thesaurus around with you will help as well.",
                "Give your inspiration a rest.[6] You may find your creativity reinvigorated if you give yourself a day or so to rest away from your work. It is easy to burn out in any creative process. When you come back, you'll hopefully have a refreshing perspective on your art.\n\n\nMost often, sleeping things over will give your brain time to consolidate your thoughts. When you make up the net morning, you'll have a fresh insight on what you worked on the day before.\nIf you're getting stressed out over the creative process, go for a walk and take half an hour to relax.",
                "Offer a sincere emotional insight.[7] Any songwriter worth his salt will tell you that the best song material is written from the heart. Although this can be different if you're attempting to \"make it big\", do the best you can to be emotionally invested in whatever music you're making. Even if you're not the one who will ultimately perform the music, you should be communicating an inner part of yourself to your prospective audience.\n\n\nTaking a page from your own life will make it easier to evoke a real emotional response. Take a life experience that moves you and write about it.",
                "Tell a story with your lyrics.[8] Some of the best songs tell a story. If there's something noteworthy that happened to your recently, consider writing a track about it. Base your verses around telling the story, while the chorus can reiterate the general theme of what you're attempting to convey.\n\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" tells the story of a man who is accused by a one night stand of being a woman's father. The story incorporates romance and a dimension of tension.",
                "Avoid cliche and forced rhymes.[9] An easy beginning mistake in writing lyrics is to place the importance of the rhyme above anything else. Rhymes can be very effective when used cleverly, but they can just as easily make lyrics feel amateurish if you're building a song specifically around them. The same idea applies to overused cliches and cheesy sentimentality as well. Although you may feel you need to rely on bombastic emotional insights to get your feeling across, you'll get better mileage by toning it down for something more intimate.\n\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" sneaks in rhyming within the same lines, but the rhymes are only used because they advance the story.",
                "Employ repetition in your lyrics.[10] Repetition allows a listener to latch onto something familiar in a song before the first listen is over. This is an important psychological aspect of music appreciation. Take the most pithy line in your lyrics and repeat it. A small verse section can be re-imagined as a chorus.\n\n\nThe most repeated lyrics in a song often ends up as the song's chorus.",
                "Match your lyrics to the music. Finally, integrate your lyrics with the melody in your song. This may involve tweaking your melody and rhythm to accommodate the lyrics. You should keep in mind however that the music should almost always come first, as it's the thing people will be focusing on the first time they hear the song.\n\n\nYou can stretch vowels and vocal sounds to match the music.[11]\n\nIf you're writing a hip-hop track, a skilled rapper will usually be able to fit irregular verses into any steady rhythm.",
                "Come up with a fitting title. A song title should catch the audience's eye immediately. Some great titles may be plucked from the lyrical ideas you've already written. While there is no single step-by-step process on how to get the perfect song title, play around with a few words or phrases and decide for yourself which one matches the message your song is getting across.\n\n\nYou might pick a title that captures the essence of your song. If your song is story-based, pick a word or theme that describes what it's about. If your song is about someone, name the song after them. Michael Jackson's song \"Billie Jean\", for example, is named after the primary character.",
                "Acknowledge the expectations of your genre.[12] Even if you're not trying yourself to a genre in the long run, it is probable that your song demos will adhere to a given style. Due to the fact that this is what people will initially judge you by, it's important to consider what people will actually be looking out for that kind of music.",
                "Develop a portfolio of demos.[13] recording a single demo isn't enough. Although people may only skim the first 30 seconds of one of your songs before moving onwards, if someone hears a song and likes it, he'll want to know that it's not just a fluke. Compile a demo collection of a few of your best songs. If you're wanting to make an impression as a versatile songwriter, you might try writing tunes in different sounds.\n\n\nYou can hire musicians or enlist friends to play your songs for you. The performance on a demo can make a major difference.",
                "Share your work with friends. Friends are a great place to start with if you have songs to show. Because friends will usually have a genuine interest in seeing you succeed, they'll be able to give you tight constructive criticism about your work. When your work is sharpened up, they can help you spread the word of your music to other people they may know.\n\n\nIf you have a friend who is already associated with professionals in the music industry, you should make an extra effort to show that person your music. Even if he's not directly associated with a label or publishing house, he may know people that could be interested in the music you're producing.",
                "Post your songs online. In an age of social media and easy networking, you can make a big name for yourself simply through word of mouth and link sharing. Provided your material is strong enough, you can post your demos on websites like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and Youtube. From there, people who come across it may be inclined to share it if they enjoy it enough.",
                "Connect with the music industry.[14] Professional songwriters may find it useful to live in one of the central hubs for the music industry, including Los Angeles, New York and London. Although these days you can actually make a start in music without ever dealing with the \"industry\", it's nonetheless a vital place to look to if you want to write songs professionally. Mail off your demos and cover letter to a variety of musical publishing houses and record labels. Try to get in contact with people who are already in the industry and tell them what you want to do.\n\n\nThe people in the music industry are quickly desensitized to the number of people who are pursuing their dreams. Don't take it personally if you get the cold shoulder treatment from these people. It's all part of the process.\nThere are agencies that base their business around helping prospective writers find work Outlets such as Taxi may be of use to you if you're having difficult linking up with the right publishers.[15]\n\nCertain genres favour certain regions. Nashville, for example, is largely enough for its bustling country music scene.",
                "Stay focused and persistent.[16] Persistence is the key. This is especially true once your music is done and it's time to show it to other people. Because there is so much music coming out these days, it may take years to properly get your foot in the door. The only thing that can defeat you is if you give up entirely. Develop a thick skin for criticism, and don't lose a passion for the songs you produce, even if you can't find a market for it yet.",
                "Decide on the kind of songwriter you want to be.[17] Songwriters come in all shapes and sizes. If you're wanting to get serious as a songwriter, you should get an idea of the direction you would like to take. Some songwriters write music to play themselves, while others work for publishing agencies and have their material used by famous artists. The vast majority of songwriters also have particular genres they're most inclined to write in. Take a moment to imagine the sort of songwriter you would like to be.",
                "Broaden your musical horizons.[18] The most successful songwriters listen to a wide variety of musical styles. This is because work isn't always available in one style. If you're aiming to make a living from your songs, you'll need to cover the range of popular musical styles. What's more, being versed in a variety of genres will open new doors to be inspired by.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to listen to types of music you don't normally listen to.",
                "Analyze a variety of hit songs.[19] As always, it's a good idea to look at hits from a variety of styles and eras. This will offer you the most dynamic insight into what a \"hit\" is, and how you can replicate that success. Here are a few hit songs you might look at for the sake of a good example:\n\n\n\"Roundabout\" by Yes.\n\"Yesterday\" by the Beatles.\n\"Trains\" by Porcupine Tree.\n\"Billie Jean\" by Michael Jackson.",
                "Attend a live concert.[20] If you're thirsting for inspiration, there are few places as well-suited to get the creative fires stoked as a live concert. Not only will you get to watch an artist passionate interpret a collection of songs, you'll also be able to see the life-affirming effect music has on the listeners. By the time you get back home, you should have a refreshed perspective on the reasons why you want to write songs.",
                "Stay busy.[21] Inspiration doesn't come to those who idle. Even if you're fixated on writing music, the only way you'll be properly inspired is if you are getting out and doing things. Spend time with friends, or go out to see new film. The more fresh stimulation your mind has, the more potential you'll have to be inspired about something."

        "How to Prepare for a Blood Test": {
            "intro": "Medical professionals order blood tests for a variety of reasons. From monitoring medication levels to evaluating your results in the course of diagnosing a medical condition, blood work can be an essential component of your health care. Specifically, blood tests are done to evaluate the function of certain organs, such as the liver or kidneys, diagnose disease, determine risk factors, check medications you are taking, and assess blood clotting.[1] Depending upon the type of blood test ordered, you’ll either have your blood drawn in their office or at another laboratory in your area. There are multiple things you can do to prepare yourself for a blood test, both mentally and physically.",
            "steps": [
                "Talk with your doctor. You need to know about the specific blood tests your doctor is ordering. Some blood tests will require special preparation to get accurate results. Some examples of common blood tests which require special preparation include:\n\n\nGlucose tolerance tests, which require fasting prior to coming to the lab. You also have to remain at the lab for up to 5 hours and your blood is taken every 30 to 60 minutes.\nFasting Glucose test, which is done after you have not eaten or had anything to drink except water for 8 to 12 hours. These tests are often first thing in the morning so you aren’t asked to go without eating all day.\nSerum Lipid testing, also called a cholesterol test, which will sometimes require you to fast for 9 to 12 hours before the test.[2]\n\nCortisol blood test, where you are asked to refrain from exercising the day before, lie down for 30 minutes before the test, and refrain from eating or drinking for 1 hour before the test.[3]",
                "Discuss your medications. There are certain substances that can alter blood tests, which you may need to stop before your blood test. Prescription medications, recreational drugs, alcohol intake, vitamins, blood thinners, or over-the-counter medications can often change the results of a blood test, depending on what the blood test is for.[4]\n\nYour physician can determine if you should wait 24 to 48 hours to have the blood work done or if what you have taken will not significantly alter the blood test results.",
                "Refrain from certain activities. There are some blood tests that can be compromised based on your activities. These tests can be altered by recent physical activity or heavy exercise, undergoing dehydration, smoking, drinking herbal teas, or sexual activity.\n\n\nYou might be asked to refrain from some of these activities prior to taking a blood test.[5]",
                "Ask your doctor for instructions. Many tests do not require special preparation prior to getting your blood drawn. However, when in doubt, ask. If your physician does not give you any special instructions, it is important that you ask in order to reduce the potential that you arrive for the test without preparing sufficiently.[6]",
                "Drink enough water. Being sufficiently hydrated makes the blood draw easier. The veins will be bigger and easier to find and the blood is not as thick and flows into the tube easier. If you need to fast from water as well, be sure you are very hydrated from the day before.\n\n\nThis may mean needing to get up during the night to urinate. However, being well hydrated will make your blood test easier.[7]",
                "Warm your extremities. Before you get ready to take a blood test, warm the extremity where the blood will be drawn. Use a warm compress over the area for 10 to 15 minutes to improve the blood flow to that area.\n\n\nWear warmer than normal clothes for the season when you go in to get your blood drawn. This increases your skin temperature, increases the blood flow to the area, and makes it easier for the phlebotomist (the person who draws your blood)[8] to find a good vein.[9]",
                "Talk to the phlebotomist. If you deviated from the instructions given to you to prepare for the blood test prior to having your blood drawn, you need to notify the person who will draw your blood when you arrive. If the deviation is significant enough to alter the results of the test, you may have to return to have the blood test drawn another day.[10]\n\nMention if you are allergic to latex or latex sensitive. Latex is in many types of gloves and band-aids, which are used while taking blood. Some people have an allergy or sensitivity to latex which can be life threatening. If you know that you have either an allergy or sensitivity, it is important to notify both your doctor and the phlebotomist so they can use latex-free equipment.[11]",
                "Stabilize your stress. Blood tests can increase your stress level or anxiety when you are nervous about the test. Unfortunately, becoming stressed increases your blood pressure, constricts your veins, and makes getting your blood drawn more difficult.[12]\n\nKnowing how to reduce your stress can help improve your preparation for the test and increase the likelihood that the phlebotomist will find the vein the first time.\nYou could try deep breathing exercises or repeating a calming phrase, such as \"This will be over very soon. Plenty of people have blood drawn. I can handle this.\" Look at the \"Stress Reduction Techniques\" section of this article for more tips.",
                "Recognize your fears. Before you go to the doctor to have your blood taken, recognize that you might be anxious about having your blood drawn. You may also have a fear of needles. Between three and 10 percent of the population has a fear of needles (Belonephobia) or a fear of all injections (Trypanophobia).[13]\n\nInterestingly, 80% of people with a phobia of needles report that they have a first-degree relative also has a strong fear of needles. It's possible this fear is partially genetic.",
                "Ask about EMLA. If you have had your blood drawn before and know that it is particularly painful for you, ask your doctor for EMLA. This is a topical anesthetic which is put on the draw site between 45 minutes to 2 hours before the blood draw to numb the area.\n\n\nIf you know that you are susceptible to pain, ask if EMLA is an option for you.[14]\n\nEMLA is commonly used for children, but it is much less common for use by adults because it takes so long to work.[15]\n\nYou can also ask about \"Numby Stuff,\" a proprietary topical preparation that includes a combination of lidocaine and epinephrine and a mild electrical current to numb an area. It works in about 10 minutes.[16]",
                "Understand how the procedure starts. To feel better mentally about having blood drawn, you need to understand the procedure. The phlebotomist will wear gloves to reduce exposure to your blood. She will usually place an elastic band around your arm above the elbow and have you make a fist. During a typical blood test, blood is usually drawn from a vein in your arm or a finger prick.\n\n\nThe elastic band expands the amount of blood in this area of the arm as blood is able to come into the arm through the arteries which are deeper in the arm, but not as much blood is able to be pumped out of the arm. This increases the size of the veins, making them easier to find and stick.[17]",
                "Know how the blood is drawn. The blood is drawn in similar ways, no matter where you get it done. A needle will go into your vein, which is usually attached to a small tube. When there is enough blood the tube, the tube is taken off, which seals automatically.\n\n\nIf more tubes are required, the needle remains in place and another tube is put on the end of the needle. Once all the tubes needed for your blood tests are filled, the phlebotomist will remove the needle and put a small gauze over the area. She will ask you to put pressure on the area while they prepare the tubes to go to the laboratory.\nYou may have a band-aid placed over the gauze to help the area to stop bleeding.\nThe whole process usually takes 3 minutes or less.[18]",
                "Breathe deeply. If you are having a hard time with the idea of getting your blood drawn, you need to relax. Take a deep breath and focus all of your attention on breathing. Deep breathing activates the body’s relaxation response. Inhale slowly to the count of four and then exhale slowly to the count of four.[19]",
                "Accept that you are anxious. Anxiety is just a feeling like any other feeling. Feelings only have control when you give them control. When you accept that you are anxious you take the power away from the feeling. If you try to get rid of the feeling it becomes overwhelming.[20]",
                "Recognize that your mind is playing tricks on you. Anxiety is a trick of the mind that has real physical consequences. Enough anxiety can produce a panic attack, which can mimic a heart attack. When you understand that your anxiety, no matter how little or big, is little more than a trick of the mind it helps reduce the pressure and responsibility of caring for yourself. [21]",
                "Ask yourself questions. When you are anxious, ask yourself several questions to determine exactly how bad the situation really is. Anxiety can increase the number of outrageous ideas you’re having while asking yourself specific questions that require realistic answers can increase your awareness. Ask yourself questions such as:\n\n\nWhat is the worst thing that can happen when they draw my blood?\nIs what I’m worried about realistic? Can it really happen to me?\nWhat is the likelihood that the worst thing will happen? [22]",
                "Use positive self-talk. You will hear what we say to yourselves, even when you don’t think that you do. Talking out loud and repeating that you are strong, can handle the situation, and that nothing bad will happen will help to reduce your feelings of anxiety.",
                "Eat a snack. If you were required to fast prior to the blood test, you’ll want to bring a snack for after the test. Also bring a bottle of water and a snack that doesn’t require refrigeration. This will tide you over until you are able to eat a meal.\n\n\nPeanut butter crackers, a peanut butter sandwich, a handful of almonds or walnuts, or whey protein are all easy to transport and will give you some protein and calories until you can get a meal.\nIf you forgot to bring anything to eat, ask the staff where you have had blood drawn. They may keep cookies or crackers around for just this purpose.",
                "Ask how long you’ll wait for results. Some tests can be finished within 24 hours while others can take a week or more if the blood must be shipped to a special laboratory. Talk with your doctor about the process used to deliver the results of the blood test. In some cases the office will not notify you if the results are all within normal limits. If the blood is sent off, also ask how long it will be before the office gets the results from the laboratory.\n\n\nAsk to be notified, even if the results are normal. This will ensure that your results don’t \"fall through the cracks\" and you aren’t notified if the results are not normal.\nCall the doctor’s office 36 to 48 hours after the results should have arrived if you are not notified.\nAsk your doctor’s office if they use an online notification system. You may be given a website to register through so your results can be delivered digitally to you.",
                "Notice a bruise. The most common side effect to having blood drawn is a bruise, or hematoma, at the site where the needle went in. The bruise can show up immediately or within 24 hours after the blood was drawn. Some of the factors that contribute to the formation of a hematoma include blood leaking out of the opening when a needle goes through a vein, which leaks into the surrounding tissue. They can also be caused by bleeding disorders or anticoagulant medications, which increases the risk that a bruise or hematoma will occur where the blood is drawn.\n\n\nApplying pressure over the area where the blood was drawn for five minutes, which is longer than necessary to stop the area from bleeding to the outside, will often help to reduce the risk of a hematoma, or a collection of blood outside of a blood vessel.[23][24]\n\nHemophilia is the most well-known bleeding disorder, but it is also fairly rare. It comes in two forms - A & B.\nVon Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common bleeding disorder, and affects how your blood clots.[25]\n\nPatient should let there doctor and phlebotomist know they have a bleeding disorder when they get there blood drawn.",
                "Ask about a possible result complications. There are certain situations that can lead to inaccurate results on your blood tests. Prolonged tourniquet application can lead to a pooling of blood in the arm or extremity where the blood was being drawn. This increases the concentration of blood and increases the potential for false positive or negative results on the blood tests.\n\n\nThe tourniquet should be in place for no longer than one minute to prevent pooling, also called hemoconcentration.\nIf longer than a minute is needed to locate a choice vein, then the tourniquet should be released and reapplied after two minutes and only immediately before the needle is inserted.[26]",
                "Discuss hemolysis with the phlebotomist. Hemolysis is a problem with the blood sample and not a complication which you experience. Hemolysis happens when the red blood cells rupture and other components spill into the blood serum. Hemolyzed blood is not acceptable for testing and another blood sample will have to be drawn. Hemolysis is more likely to occur when:\n\n\nThe tube is mixed vigorously after being removed from the needle.\nDrawing blood from a vein near a hematoma.\nUsing a smaller needle which damages the cells as they are drawn into the tube.\nExcessive fist clenching during the blood draw.\nLeaving the tourniquet on for more than one minute."

        "How to Tighten Your Thighs": {
            "intro": "There are two elements to improving muscle tone on the body. The first is fat loss, and the second is muscle gain. Fat loss without muscle gain will reveal muscle tone in much the same way that an underweight person will have visible abdominal muscles. Muscle gain without fat loss will result in increased size and strength, but may have little to no visible muscle tone.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose leg exercises that suit you. Some good exercises associated with tight thighs (and legs in general) include squats, lunges, deadlifts, kettlebell swings and several variations upon these exercises. Depending on what you're going for, and the resources available to you, it's good to pick some combination of strength training and isometric exercises, which only use your body weight as resistance.\n\n\nConsider joining a local gym, which may have several machines dedicated to exercising your legs.",
                "Do squats. Doing squats is the best way to tighten not only your thighs, but your legs, buns, and abs. Do squats in different positions for different results. To do a squat, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and flex your legs until your thighs are at a 90° angle with the floor. Keep your back straight and your butt back. Then, stand back up to straight. Repeat this 20-50 times, doing sets of 10-15.\n\n\nThe sumo squat is a great way to tone your inner and outer thighs. To do this, take the widest stance possible, then squat as low as you can. Do this 20-50 or more times a day to see fast results.\nAnother great one is the plie squat. This is great for toning. To do this, put your arms above your head like a ballerina about to do a plie, while keeping your legs together. Then extend one leg from your right or left side, step into a wider stance and squat. Do 20-50 repetitions per day.",
                "Do lunges. Lunges are a wonderful way to tone the lower body. To do lunges, stand with your hands on your hips and your feet together. Extend one leg and step forward and squat with your left leg still behind you. Repeat this as many times as you can on each leg.\n\n\nLunges will target and tone your thigh areas if done correctly. The great thing about lunges is that if you do do them consistently and correctly, you will see amazing results, as it takes more effort than doing squats.\nIf you have any sort of knee issues, lunges can be difficult. Squats are a bit easier on the knees.",
                "Do butterflies. Butterflies are done by laying on your side with your legs in an almost seated position. Your knees should be parallel to your groin. From there, move your leg up and down locked in that position like a butterfly flaps its wings. Do this about 50 times on each side.",
                "Focus on full-body cardio workouts. You can't spot-reduce fat. Any activity or diet which burns fat from your body will burn that fat proportionately over your body, not specifically near the area or muscle group which has been worked. For instance, doing squats will not reduce the fat on your buttocks and legs before anything else. Squats will help reduce the fat on your whole body, however. Here are a variety of cardio exercises you can do that will help you lose fat and tone your thighs:\n\n\nJogging or running\nBurpees\nDancing\nYoga\nPilates\nSwimming",
                "Train with low weight and high repetitions. If you want to strength train with added weight, it's important to focus on doing a high number of repetitions with a low amount of weight. This is how to tone muscles. If you want to build muscles, you should focus on doing fewer reps with a higher amount of weight. An example leg workout for someone aiming for lean, toned legs might look like this:\n\n\nSquats (with 10lbs dumbells): 3 sets of 12 repetitions.\nLunges (with 10lbs dumbells): 3 sets of 12 repetitions.\nSingle-arm kettlebell swings (with 10lbs kettlebell): 3 sets of 20 repetitions per arm.\nFarmer's walk on the balls of your feet (with 20+ lbs dumbells) 2 minutes walk around the gym.",
                "Include upper-body exercises as well. Make sure that you are also constructing a workout for the rest of your body so that you don't end up with super-strong legs and a weak and poorly toned upper body. At least a little bit of cardio in your weekly routine will also help to improve your overall health and muscle tone. You will also be able to work out more and burn more fat if you incorporate other major muscle groups and exercises into your workouts, so be sure to build a full workout routine. Here are a variety of upper-body exercises you can try:",
                "Replace empty calories with fruits and vegetables. If you want to tone your muscles and lose fat, you need to burn more than you take in. It's as simple–and as complicated–as that. To start out with, replace the snack food crackers, chips, frozen dinners, and other highly-processed pre-packaged foods with basic fruits and vegetables.\n\n\nYou don't have to stop snacking if you want to lose weight. But instead of reaching for a handful of chips, have an apple. Instead of munching on Cheetos, have a handful of grapes or almonds and berries.\nYou can't out-train a bad diet. Even if you're working hard, you won't be able to tone your thighs if you're still eating junk.",
                "Focus on lean proteins. Chicken, fish, and nuts are all excellent sources of protein that are an essential part of building and toning out your muscles as you work. As you're working out, it's important to focus on getting plenty of lean proteins into your diet. 2-3 servings per day. As you're working aim for at least 5-6 servings of complex carbs per day.",
                "Eat complex carbohydrates. Brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and whole wheat pastas and breads are excellent sources of carbs for your workouts. Complex carbohydrates take a long time to digest, meaning that they'll fuel your workouts and help you to lose weight.\n\n\nA lot of people are carb-conscious when it comes to losing weight, and that's fine. But it's quick-digesting carbs that you want to avoid, not complex carbs. Your body needs carbohydrates to function problems, so you can't avoid them entirely.",
                "Eat at least 3-4 times a day. It's important to spread your eating out throughout the day, having a variety of small meals and healthy snacks all day long to keep your metabolism high and working for you, instead of against you.\n\n\nInstead of skipping breakfast, eating an energy bar at lunch and having a huge dinner, eat a full and healthy breakfast, and treat yourself to a handful of almonds and dried fruit when you're feeling hungry at 3 pm. This is a better way to lose weight than skipping meals.\nNever skip breakfasts. Eating in the mornings helps to energize your body and awaken your metabolism. Breakfast is an important weight loss tool.",
                "Drink plenty of water. When you're hungry, drink a glass of water. When you're thirsty, drink a glass of water. Even if you're not thirsty, have some water on hand to make sure you're staying hydrated. People need up to two liters of water a day to stay fully hydrated. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need.\n\n\nCut down alcohol. Did you know that a glass of wine is contain of as many calories as a piece of chocolate? If you regularly consume too much alcohol, you'll gain weight and it'll be very difficult to train away."

        "How to Desensitize Your Dog": {
            "intro": "It's heartbreaking to see our dogs shy away from people, objects, and other animals that can enrich their lives. To put your dog at ease, you can desensitize him or her through gradual exposure and by creating new, positive associations with its triggers. Over time, your dog will learn to overcome its fear and live a fuller, happier life.",
            "steps": [
                "Identify your dog’s triggers.[1] The trigger is the object, person, or place which causes the dog to panic. Dogs react in different ways to their triggers. For instance, your dog might put its tail between its legs, bark, run away, or whimper in fear. It might react aggressively to certain stimuli, for instance by barking, lowering its head, or bristling the hair on its back.\n\n\nMake note of situations in which your dog demonstrates signs of fear, aggression, or other unwanted behaviors. Look for patterns in the their negative behavior and identify specifically what triggers your pet.",
                "Rank your dog’s triggers. After discovering your dog’s triggers, write each on a piece of paper, starting with the most serious and working your way down to the least serious. For instance, perhaps your dog is agitated by all visitors in the house, but is especially rattled by young children. You could rank adults as less scary for the dog than children. Does your dog demonstrate fear at being picked up, or being picked up in a certain way? Do all little children trigger your dog, or are crying children more traumatic for your dog?[2] Use these and similar questions to figure out exactly what fears are most and least serious in the dog’s mind.",
                "Expose the dog to its triggers gradually.[3] Start with the most mild trigger. Suppose your dog is very scared of adult men, somewhat less scared by adult women, and mildly scared of little children. By exposing your dog to, for instance, young children for a short time each day, your dog will gradually begin to realize that the trigger is nothing to be afraid of. You could have your dog spend five minutes each day with young children.\n\n\nAfter a week or so, you could increase the amount of time spent to ten minutes each day.\nAfter another week, you could increase the time spent in the presence of children to fifteen minutes.\nWhen your dog is comfortable with young children, move on to the next trigger level (adult women in the above example). Repeat the process until it has been desensitized to all negative triggers.\nExposing your dog deliberately to its triggers for a specific amount of time constitutes a training session.",
                "Try not to expose your dog to its triggers outside of training. If your dog is triggered by young children, for instance, do not bring your dog to the local playground unless you intend to have a training session there. If your dog is exposed to stimuli in an uncontrolled environment or at rates which are greater than those you’ve been using during exposure training, your work could be jeopardized and your dog may revert to its old habits.",
                "Choose how to modify your dog’s behavior. There are two ways to modify your dog’s behavior: counter-conditioning or gradual desensitization. The two modes are virtually identical and usually used together. Used with care over a long period, either mode will reduce your dog’s trigger responses gradually.[4]\n\nGradual desensitization calls for the dog to be slowly exposed to its trigger over time, increasing the intensity or proximity of contact with the trigger until it no longer causes your dog’s negative behavior.\nCounter-conditioning calls for your dog to be slowly exposed to its trigger over time and respond in a different, more positive way than it naturally would when in the presence of the trigger. If your dog learns quickly and likes treats, counter-conditioning is probably the best choice.",
                "Be patient with your dog. Different dogs react to different stimuli in particular ways. Something like garbage trucks which causes one dog no stress at all might be a significant trigger for another dog. Do not increase the level of exposure to the trigger stimulus too quickly or your dog might become even more, not less, sensitive to the trigger and come to mistrust you.\n\n\nSome dogs might be quickly desensitized in a mater of weeks, while others might take months to change their behavior.[5]",
                "Identify a reward your dog likes. Counter-conditioning requires replacing a negative reaction like fear with a positive reaction by changing the association your dog has to a given stimulus.[6] In order to counter-condition your dog, you’ll need to know what your dog likes. The most useful choice for a reward is a doggie treat. Alternatively, you could use small strips of chicken, beef, or liverwurst. Find a treat your dog likes and use it to counter-condition your dog.",
                "Give your dog a reward when exposing it to its trigger.[7] For instance, if your dog is triggered by young children, sit with your dog while a young child is in view. When your dog is calm, either before it can start panicking or after the panicking ends, give it a small, yummy snack. It's crucial to only give the dog a treat when it's calm; rewarding it while it's still fearful can train the dog to be scared.",
                "Gradually expose your dog to more intense triggers.[8] For instance, in the case of a dog who fears bikers, after achieving counter-conditioning with your dog at 30 yards, you could move your dog closer at a range of 25 yards. After your dog is comfortable with a biker at this range, move your dog closer to the stimulus at 20 yards. Remember to feed your dog a steady stream of treats while the trigger is in view. Continue in this way until the trigger does not inspire the negative response.",
                "Expose your dog to its trigger in ten-minute intervals. These need not be continuous minutes. For instance, you could expose your dog to its trigger for three minutes, then rest one minute, then repeat, and end with a short two-minute trigger exposure.",
                "Combine rewards when your dog stays calm during trigger exposure. For instance, you could both feed your dog a yummy snack and also pet it gently. Or, you could give your pet a snack while saying comforting things to it like, “Good dog,” or “You’re doing great” in a calm, reassuring tone.\n\n\nWhen your dog can be exposed to its trigger without demonstrating negative behavior, you can stop giving it treats and celebrate having successfully counter-conditioned your dog.\nDon’t combine treats for good behavior with yelling or punishment when your dog reacts negatively to the trigger.[9] Punishment or scolding will only slow the process of desensitization and counter-conditioning.",
                "Maintain your dog’s good behavior. Conduct follow-up sessions at least twice a month so that your dog will not develop its fear again. Monitor your dog for signs of backsliding. Should your dog begin to show sensitivity to the trigger which you worked on before, do another round of desensitization training to prevent the recurrence of the negative response.\n\n\nIf your dog has serious trouble maintaining its good behavior, or if counter-conditioning seems ineffective, consult your vet about the possibility of using anxiety medications to calm your dog. Medication can be helpful to keep a dog calm during desensitization and counter-conditioning training.[10]"
