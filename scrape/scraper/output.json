        "wikiHow to Make Hair Conditioner": {
            "intro": "Conditioner is used to balance the pH of your hair and return essential oils and shine to your hair after shampooing. Making your own conditioner at home is a great way to save money and stop using chemicals in your hair, and most of the ingredients are already in your house.",
            "steps": [
                "Mix 1/2 cup plain yogurt, mayonnaise, and one egg white together for a quick conditioner. While some people are little turned-off by the idea of using a condiment for conditioner, mayonnaise is a great way to add a healthy shine to your hair. The egg whites contain proteins that help damaged hair, and the vinegar helps restore a balanced pH to your scalp.[1] This little mixture spreads easily and can be used just like normal conditioner. Simply whisk them together in a bowl and apply like normal.\n\n\nDo not use hot water to wash your hair or you risk cooking the egg whites on your head.\nSubstitute vanilla yogurt for plain for a light vanilla scent.[2]",
                "Mix together a tablespoon of honey, half cup of whole milk, and a few drops of olive oil in a bowl or cup. Stir the mixture well and apply it to your head.[3]\n\nAdd a teaspoon of cinnamon for a wonderful, spiced scent.\nSome people believe that adding one pureed banana can also help prevent hair breakage.[4]",
                "Try aloe vera or shea butter conditioner to fight split ends. Mix either aloe or shea butter with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to make it easily spreadable, then mix it over your hair after shampoo. You can also skip the olive oil for a simple and effective leave-in conditioner.\n\n\nYou won't need a lot-- simply put a little on your fingertips and focus on the ends of your hair to fight split ends.[5]",
                "Coat your hair with warm coconut or olive overnight. Oil is essential for healthy hair, so this overnight conditioner is a great way to get your hair happy and healthy. Be sure to cover your hair with a shower cap to prevent the oil from getting on your sheets. This is particularly useful for dry, damaged hair. Repeat 2-3 times a week, or as often as you hair requires.[6]\n\nHeat the oil up until it is warm, but not hot, to the touch.\nMassage the oil into your hair, spreading it from the scalp up to the end of the hair.\nRinse the oil out in the morning.",
                "Use avocado as the base of a deep-cleansing conditioner. The following recipe combines many of the principles of homemade conditioners to make a deep cleaning, dandruff fighting conditioner. Use a blender to mix the following ingredients and reap the homemade-rewards:\n\n\n1 fully ripened avocado,\n2-3 teaspoons honey,\n1 tsp coconut oil,\n1/4 cup aloe vera juice, (available at most health stores and specialty grocers)\n1 tsp fresh lemon juice.[7]\n\nIf the mixture is too thick, add more aloe vera or some water.",
                "Add herbs, oils, or scents to your mix to customize your conditioner. The basics of conditioner are actually pretty simple: a base (like yogurt, avocado, honey), a pH balancer (vinegar, lemon juice), and some oil (coconut, olive, mayo). From there you have free reign to mix and match ingredients to get the right balance for you. Try adding:\n\n\nGround flax seeds.\nLavender, lemon, sage, bergamot, or rosemary extract.\nMilk or cream to thin the mixture and make it easier to apply.[8]",
                "Know that apple cider vinegar is great at balancing the pH of your hair. This classic liquid is the basis of many home remedies and is an all-natural way to keep your hair clean and shiny. It is mixed with water, so don't fret about your hair smelling vinegary. A quick rinse will get rid of any odor.[9]",
                "Combine 1 cup water and 1 cup vinegar and mix well. Simply combine the liquids and shake them until they are well mixed. Your basic conditioner is done. Shake the bottle before using it to make sure it is still well mixed.[10]\n\nThis simple mixture is a good base that will help customize your conditioner.",
                "Add essential oils like lavender or bergamot if you have greasy hair. These oils will clean off your hair and return essential oils to hair follicles. This prevents your hair from overcompensating and producing a lot of oil shortly after you get out of the shower, which leads to greasy hair. Add 6-7 drops the following essential oils:\n\n\nBergamot\nLavender\nLemon\nRosemary\nSandalwood\nTea tree[11]",
                "Add dandruff fighting oils if you are having trouble with flakes. Apple cider vinegar conditioner can be quickly adapted to deal with dandruff. Simply add 6-7 drops of the following oils and extracts to help fight off flakes:\n\n\nPeppermint\nLavender\nLemon\nThyme\nRosemary[12]",
                "Soak sprigs of rosemary or lavender in your mixture for 1-2 weeks to get scented conditioner. Simply add the springs after mixing up the conditioner and leave them in for a few weeks. Strain out the branches when you are done for conditioner that leaves your head smelling wonderful for 1-2 hours after using it.[13]",
                "Wet your hair with cool or cold water. Hot water damages your hair by opening up pores on the hair shaft, allowing moisture and oil to escape.[14]\n\nIf you love hot showers, try dosing your hair with cold water for 30 seconds right before getting out to mitigate some of the effects.",
                "Squeeze the water out of your hair before applying conditioner. Your hair is already soaking with water, making it harder to get the conditioner into the hair strand. After rinsing, dry out your hair a bit by lightly squeezing it. You can even lightly blot your hair with a towel to get rid of surface water.[15]",
                "Apply conditioner to the tips of your hair. You don't want to massage the conditioner into your scalp where it won't do you any good. Spread the conditioner along your palms and then, starting in the middle of your hair, work it out towards the tips.\n\n\nYou only need a half-dollar sized dollop of conditioner -- too much may weigh down your hair and make it appear flat.",
                "Leave the conditioner in for 2-5 minutes before rinsing out. This gives your hair time to absorb the conditioner and leaves it clean and happy.",
                "Try using conditioner before, not after, you shampoo. Most people naturally shampoo their hair and then apply conditioner, but a recent \"reverse wash\" trend promises shiny, high-volume hair. Simply apply conditioner, leave it in for several minutes, and then rinse it out before applying shampoo.[16]\n\nDon't worry if your hair feels greasy after the conditioner -- the shampoo will deal with this.\nTry out the reverse routine for a week and see how it feels. It is easy to go back if you aren't satisfied with the results.",
                "Use conditioner even when you don't shampoo. Shampoo strips essential oils from your hair, and should really only be used every 2-3 days. But you should always use conditioner, as it restores your hair's pH balance and lends it a gorgeous sheen.[17]\n\nPeople with greasier hair may need to shampoo more often.\nYou can use a small amount of conditioner without showering too. Just use your fingertips to massage it into the tips of your hair -- it will soak it up."

            "intro": "Many people prefer Apple computers, but balk at the steep prices. If you know where to look, you can often cut 10% off the Apple Store price. Discounts of 20% or more are not uncommon, especially if you don't need the latest model.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a model. If you're only interested in the latest models, compare them with Apple's online tool. For older models, check out buyer's guides from Mac Rumors and similar sites.\n\n\nIf you're new to Macs, visit a physical Apple Store for personal assistance. Just don't be tempted to buy on the spot — there are better deals.\nApple tends to release new computer models every six months or less. If the current model has been around a few months, wait for an update. The \"old\" model will drop in price.",
                "Get an educational discount if possible. Current or incoming college students get a major discount, as do faculty and staff at any school. Visit the online education store to get the cheaper price. After you choose a product and enter payment info, Apple will send you to another site to verify your status for free.\n\n\nYou'll need proof of your educational status (typically a student or staff ID). If you do not have this, call or visit an Apple Store for advice.[1]\n\nLook for summer back to school deals. Apple usually throws in a free $100 gift card to the App Store.[2]",
                "Shop for refurbished computers. Refurbished computers were returned to Apple due to some defect, but have since been fixed and tested thoroughly. Most are identical to a brand new computer, and with free returns you can't really go wrong. They're typically between 10% and 20% off, but you can only choose from a limited selection.\n\n\nRemember to check the exact model of each computer. An older model can save you some money, but make sure it has the specs you need.",
                "Check for clearance products. Apple does have clearance sales, but they're not common. Check them out from time to time and you might get lucky.",
                "Look for quality used computers. Apple does not allow other sellers to use the term \"refurbished.\"[3] This means \"used\" Apple computers range from dented bricks to fully repaired beauties. PowerMax and Simply Mac are two sellers that offer \"used\" computers that are often as good as new.[4]\n\nUsed computers may lack the original packaging and manual.\nYou can find cheaper deals on other sites, but check for Apple certification and good customer reviews before you buy.",
                "Find cheaper new computers. Even if none of the discount options above are right for you, you can save money just by shopping around. The Apple Store almost always lists the highest prices. Instead, browse authorized apple resellers such as MacMall or Mac Connection, and larger retailers such as Best Buy.\n\n\nApple has approved sellers with an \"Apple Authorized Reseller\" title. Stores that offer excellent guidance earn \"Apple Specialist\" status.\nSearch the store's online site first for discount offers. If you decide to visit in person, print out the online deal and take it with you.",
                "Compare close offers between resellers. If you find two or three offers that are fairly close in price, read the fine print. Many resellers offer extra deals, such as discount Apple Care warranties or free software. If you plan on purchasing the \"extra\" anyway, the nominally more expensive computer might be the better deal.\n\n\nThe Apple Store rarely offers this kind of deal on computers, except in the educational store.",
                "Install extra RAM yourself. Upgrading the RAM on a new Mac computer can make it much faster, but buying the RAM yourself is much cheaper than getting it from Apple.[5] All you need to install the RAM is steady hands, a screwdriver, and a set of instructions. We've got the last covered with guides for Mac Mini, iMac, and MacBook Pro.\n\n\nNot all RAM is created equal. As of late 2015, DDR3 and DDR4 are the latest standards, and comparable in performance for home users.[6]",
                "Consider buying hard drive space separately. Buying a separate hard drive is generally cheaper than upgrading your Mac's hard drive size at the time of purchase. Just store the files you don't use as often on the backup.",
                "Be careful with third-party laptop chargers. Mac laptop chargers are notoriously expensive. Unfortunately, the ultra-cheap options are usually knockoffs that overheat or fail after a short time. It's best to stick with chargers made by Apple.\n\n\nEven used laptops usually come with a charger, so you don't need to worry about this for a while."

            "intro": "Air traffic control (ATC) is responsible for providing crucial information to pilots around busy airports. They communicate with pilots on designated radio frequencies to keep airport operations running smoothly and safely. Their communication is also accessible to the public. Whether you are a student pilot, retired pilot or just want to know what's going on in the friendly skies, you can listen to air traffic controllers at work any time.",
            "steps": [
                "Find live frequencies. Obtain a radio scanner that is capable of receiving frequencies between 118.0 and 136.975 MHz. Good brands to check out include Uniden, and Whistler. You can also find general coverage receivers from Icom, Yaesu, Grundig, Kenwood and others that will pick up air frequencies. You're better off selecting a good scanner instead of a general coverage unit, thanks to the scanner's ability to easily monitor multiple frequencies. Realize that in radio electronics, you get what you pay for. A scanner from one of the aforementioned brands will outperform a no-name brand that claims airline coverage. Most scanners pick up the entirety of the aircraft band. You can also listen to air traffic control facilities from around the world at websites including liveatc.net, globalair.com, airnav.com and radioreference.com",
                "Memorize some of the basic frequencies.\n\n\n121.5 is the emergency frequency. If there is some sort of emergency, pilots will transmit on it. You could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes.\n122.750 MHz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications\n123.025 MHz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications\n123.450 MHz is the \"unofficial\" frequency for air to air communications\nSearch 122.0-123.65 for Unicom (uncontrolled airports) and air to air communications.\nSearch 128.825-132.000 MHz for ARINC frequencies (airlines, corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel, parking, and other requests).",
                "Find an aeronautical sectional chart. You most likely want to be looking for a chart of your local area from the closest airport. Older versions of these charts will usually work just fine. Online sectional charts for your local area are available on www.skyvector.com",
                "Find the closest airport on the chart. Airports are denoted by blue or magenta circles, with lines inside representing runways. Next to the circle is a block of text with the airport name and information about that airport. The control tower frequency is denoted by CT - 000.0, where the following numbers indicate the frequency used by ATC. For example, the frequency for Wittman Regional airport in Oshkosh, WI is CT - 118.5.",
                "If the airport is uncontrolled (no tower) or the tower operates part time, a C in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). A star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower. At this type of airport, pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions.",
                "All controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles, while uncontrolled airports are magenta. Airports with runways over 8,000 feet (2,438.4 m) are not enclosed in circles and simply have a diagram depicting the runway layout, which is outlined in blue (controlled) or magenta (uncontrolled).",
                "Some airports have AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System), ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System), or ATIS (Automated Terminal Information Service) frequencies listed on the chart. These are automated or repeating broadcasts that provide pilots with weather and airport information as they prepare to land or depart.",
                "If you have access to an airport/facility directory, you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart. At larger airports, pilots receive their flight plan clearances from a \"clearance delivery\" frequency, communicate on taxiways with a \"ground\" frequency, and get takeoff and landing clearance from the \"tower\" frequency. Once pilots are airborne, they will talk to an \"approach/departure\" frequency, and once in route, they might even talk to a \"center\" frequency. If you are lucky or live close enough to an airport, you might be able to receive several of these frequencies.",
                "If a controller gives a pilot an instruction, he or she will prefix it with the aircraft's identification number. For commercial flights, this will just be the flight number, such as United 2311. A smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail.",
                "After the flight number, the controller will give an instruction such as \"enter downwind.\" This instructs the pilot to enter the traffic pattern at a specific location. The pilot will then read back the instruction, so the controller can verify that it was understood correctly.",
                "Sometimes, controllers will \"hand off\" a pilot to another frequency. An example would be a controller saying, \"November-12345, contact Approach on 124.32, good day.\" Once again, the pilot will read back the instruction.",
                "Operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal. Most of the time, pilots will broadcast blind transmissions to anyone on the frequency, announcing their position or intentions. Words like \"upwind, crosswind, downwind, base, and final\" denote specific positions in the traffic pattern.",
                "Learn the phonetic alphabet. Pilots and controllers use it to communicate letters, since they can often be confused. You might also hear someone use \"niner\" to communicate \"nine,\" \"fife\" to communicate \"five,\" or \"tree\" to communicate \"three.\""

            "intro": "Spilled milk can seep deep into into car upholstery and leave nasty lingering odors. It does not matter whether you are dealing with old spills or brand new ones. There are ways to restore your car's great smell, and prevent those spoiled milk odors from returning when milk spills again.",
            "steps": [
                "Pat dry spilled milk. Immediately after a spill, clean up any excess spilled milk that is still wet or visible. This will help to remove spoiled milk smells from inside a car and make it easier to clean later on.[1]\n\nUse paper towels, a white wash cloth, or a sponge and press it against any fabric or upholstery where milk has spilled. Continue padding the area until you have soaked up all of the moisture.[2]",
                "Remove and wash the floor mats and seat covers. Any fabric or area that has a spill on it and can be removed, should.[3]\n\nFloor mats without plastic or rubber can be washed in a household washing machine. Spray the mats with a stain remover, and put them in the washing machine on warm.\nAll other materials should be sprayed with a hose or washed in a tub with water and soap. Let the mats air dry in the house or outside in the sun.",
                "Utilize a wet vacuum. Use a deep cleaning or steam cleaning vacuum to get deep-set spoiled milk odors out of your car. Many steam cleaners use solutions with special cleaning agents to eliminate food smells, which could help you get rid of the smell of spoiled milk.",
                "Hire an expert. Spoiled milk odors that persist after you've tried home remedies could be so deep in your car's upholstery that you can't reach them with simple methods. Consult an upholstery cleaning expert or a professional car retailer about having the car professionally cleaned and detailed to remove the spoiled milk odors from the car's interior.",
                "Use coffee grounds to pull stubborn odors. Coffee grounds will help to absorb spoiled odors that come from old milk and leave behind a coffee scent that will help mask unpleasant smells.[4]\n\nFill plastic containers with coffee grounds and slide them under your car seats. Let them stay there for about two weeks.[5]",
                "Use the power of baking soda. Apply a layer of baking soda on the affected area to absorb moisture and spoiled milk odors. Baking soda works to filter the air and remove bad odors.[6]\n\nAllow the area where the milk has spilled to dry completely before sprinkling baking soda directly on the area. Let it sit for three to four days, and then vacuum it out of the upholstery.",
                "Spray white vinegar. Vinegar has strong, odor-fighting powers, so try using it if spoiled milk odors are present. This will help break up enzymes from the milk trapped in the car's upholstery and reduce the odors. Best of all, it is safe to use and does not contain any dangerous chemicals.[7]\n\nMix one part white vinegar with four parts water into a spray bottle. Spray the vinegar mixture directly to the affected area until it is completely drenched. Let it soak for about four to five hours, and then blot the area dry with a white wash cloth.[8]\n\nLeave your car windows open to allow air ventilation.[9]",
                "Try an enzyme spray. Purchase an enzyme cleaning product at your nearby home improvement store and spray any milk affected areas. The enzyme spray will eat away at the odor residues and leave a fresh scent behind.[10]\n\nLet the enzyme spray to set in for one to two days, and then blot the area dry.\nDo not use an enzyme spray on leather or suede.",
                "Try a carpet cleaner. Carpet cleaners have strong chemicals in them that work to clean deep into fabrics. Just be sure to remove any moisture left behind after you have finished using the carpet cleaning.\n\n\nRead the instructions to determine how long you need to leave on the product and then vacuum it out.",
                "Air your car out. One of the reason spoiled milk odors develop are because the moisture becomes trapped in the car and start to grow mildew. After a spill, or during a cleaning session, leave you car windows open and in the sun so the upholstery can dry out, and new air can flow in.",
                "Wipe up any spills immediately. The longer milk, or any type of spill sits, the harder it is to remove the stain and smell. The sooner you soak up the spill, the better your chances are at preventing a smell from forming.",
                "Let fresh air in. After milk is spilled, it is always a good idea to open the car windows for a few hours. This will allow any milk moisture that has evaporated into your car's air to leave and be replaced with fresh air.[11]",
                "Keep the inside of the car clean. Food and liquid can provide favorable conditions for bacteria to begin growing and smelling. Regularly vacuuming and shaking off car floor mats can be a great way to prevent bad odors."

        "How to Fit Golf Clubs": {
            "intro": "Players at all skill levels benefit from the use of custom-fit golf clubs. If you feel like your golf game needs improvement, investing in a set of clubs that fit you like a glove can help you compete at your highest level. To learn what kind of clubs you need, you need a few specific measurements and some basic information about your style of play.",
            "steps": [
                "Measure your height. Clubs are matched to your height and the distance between your hands and the ground. To find the right size clubs for your body, use recent height measurement to determine the proper angle for your clubs. It usually helps to have another person measure, so you get the most accurate measurements possible.[1]\n\nMeasure your basic height from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. Stand up as straight as possible to get the measurement. You don't need to be in your swing stance.",
                "Measure your wrist-floor length. The other essential measurement that you'll need is the distance between your wrists and the ground. Stand as straight as possible, letting your arms hang loosely at your sides. Ask your helper to measure from the top of your wrist, where the top of the club would be, to the floor.",
                "Swing a standard-length club at the store. If you're considering investing in custom clubs, these two basic measurements will give you specific angle information and a plus-or-minus length requirement based on the standard club length. In other words, height and wrist-floor are the only measurements you need before you head to the store and talk to a salesperson about custom clubs. Typically, size-fitters will work with you to examine your swing on a standard-size club and use your measurements to determine which clubs will be most appropriate for your style of play.\n\n\nAlternatively, it's good for the fitter to see you swing the clubs you already own and play with regularly to see what might make for a good corrective size, helping to address any inconsistencies in your swing.\nStandard size golf club lengths are different for men and women. Each club, from the driver to the wedge, also has it's own standard length, so you must be fit each type.\nIf you want to do a quick-check of your measurements and get a sense of your plus-or-minus length score, you can plug your numbers in here.",
                "Provide your handicap. If you play with a handicap, it can be helpful to provide it when you head to the pro shop to check out clubs. If you're not sure of your handicap, a basic description of your skill level can go a long way in helping the fitter match you with the right kinds of clubs that will help improve your game.\n\n\nOne of the most common reasons for just buying clubs off the rack is that golfers say, \"I'm not good enough for a custom club.\" In fact, players with a higher handicap have a game that can be much more drastically improved with the use of custom-fit clubs that help to train the swinging motion properly.[2]",
                "Determine your swing speed, if possible. When you're sure you've nailed down the proper length and angle of the clubs you need, the next step in the customization process is figuring out what kind of flex and grip works best for your particularly style of play. To do this, most custom fitters will want to watch you swing, but you can also provide some of the basic information necessary yourself to figure out what will improve your game the most.\n\n\nTo determine your swing speed, you'll likely need access to an electronic launch monitor and a radar machine available at most high-end pro shops. It'll be difficult to do at home. In general, though, most amateurs fall somewhere in the neighborhood of 80–85 mile (129–137 km)-per-hour swings.[3]\n\nIn general, people with faster swings prefer stiff shafts on their woods and iron shafts on the irons. People with slower swings are more likely to prefer flex shafts on the woods and graphite shafts on the irons.",
                "Keep track of how far you consistently hit your drive. When you're hitting with your wooden drivers, it's helpful to keep track of your average drive on each different club, which can help to match you with a properly flexed set of drivers. Follow the guidelines below to determine the flex your woods should have.\n\n\nLess than 180 yards (165 meters), use ladies flex.\nBetween 181 to 200 yards (166 to 183 meters), use senior flex.\nBetween 200 to 235 yards (183 to 215 meters), use regular flex.\nBetween 236 to 275 yards (216 to 251 meters), use stiff flex.\nMore than 275 yards (251 meters), use extra-stiff flex.",
                "Determine the right flex for your irons. Determining iron flex will depend on which club you generally use to hit a shot of 150 yards (137 meters). So, in other words, if you were lining up to take a 150 yard shot, which club would you reach for?\n\n\nIf a 4 or 5 iron, ladies flex.\nIf a 5 iron, senior flex.\nIf a 6 iron, soft regular flex.\nIf a 7 iron, regular flex.\nIf a 7 or 8 iron, firm flex.\nIf an 8 iron, stiff flex.\nIf a 9 iron, extra stiff flex.",
                "Fit each club wearing golf gloves. A golf glove should fit snugly without wrinkles or creases, working with the grip on the individual clubs to give you the most secure and comfortable contact possible. In general, the larger your glove size, the larger the grip you should use. Grips range from a standard ladies size to an oversized men's grip. The wrong grip can cause friction and disrupt an otherwise perfect swing. Use the pinch test to determine golf glove fit. You should have just a pinch of material at the tips of the fingers and absolutely no pinch in the palm of your hand. Use the size of the properly-fitting glove to get the right grip:\n\n\nIf you use a small or cadet-small glove, use a lady standard grip.\nIf you use a medium or medium-large glove, use a standard grip.\nIf you use a large glove, use a mid-size grip.\nIf you use an extra large glove, use an oversize grip.",
                "Talk to a golf pro. No, you don't have to call up Tiger to get advice. A \"pro\" is a person who works in the golf shop and teaches lessons, the golf equivalent of a personal trainer. It's useful to get a pro to help you learn more about your shots and your needs from a set of clubs. It can be tricky for non-experts to tell whether high and low shots are caused by improper technique or poorly fitted clubs.",
                "Try a lot of different clubs first. If you're considering investing in a set of custom clubs, it's a good idea to establish a play style and get experienced before investing in a brand new set. Focus on developing a consistent swing, getting your score below the 100s on a standard 18 hole course before you invest the big money sets.\n\n\nAsk golfing buddies, family, or golf shop employees to let you try different clubs on the driving range. You can predict what you're going to like a little bit based on your height and swing speed, but a lot of it is also personal taste. Choose a standard club to practice.",
                "Get the right clubs for your loft. The \"loft\" of particular clubs is based on how your shots tend to fly, which is another reason you need some experience in order to be properly fitted. If you notice that you're consistently hitting higher than you'd like, try to go for less loft in your clubs. If you're hitting a bit lower than the ideal range, you might prefer a higher loft.",
                "Consider getting some hybrid clubs. Some experienced golfers like to use long irons or hybrids to fill the gap between a 5 iron and your woods. Some people swear by hybrid clubs, while other people prefer the low irons. Only time on the course and range will really tell you what you like and what works best for you.",
                "Go with what feels right. There's no ideal size. Even the \"custom\" numbers are less important than what you feel comfortable playing. If you're going to invest in an expensive set of clubs, make sure you enjoy playing with it.\n\n\nTry out short clubs in various situations from various distances and see what works for your style. Head to any Golfsmith and there will be a small putting area for testing clubs. Try not to get distracted by all of the crazy looking options and focus instead on which ones you're actually getting the ball into the hole with."

For example, bicep curls can help you prepare to carry a baby and a diaper bag. Leg strengthening exercises will help support the weight of your growing body.[22]",
                "Practice regular yoga or Pilates. Try a yoga or Pilates class either in a studio or online. These lower-impact activities can help strengthen and stretch your muscles while helping you to relax.[23]\n\nThere are a wide variety of video-based yoga and Pilates courses available. You may consider purchasing DVDs, which can offer basic guided sessions for you to follow. You can also search online for videos or courses that guide you through different levels of yoga and Pilates sessions.[24]\n\nYou may be able to attend a class or find a video of a pre-natal yoga class, which is tailored specifically to a pregnant body and helping it prepare for childbirth.",
                "Listen to your body. If you decide to stay fit with exercise during your pregnancy, it’s important to listen to your body during any activity. This can help you identify if you’re tired, need to hydrate, or are experiencing the signs of a more serious problem.\n\n\nPermit yourself to rest when you want. If you feel tired or don’t want to exercise one day, allow yourself to rest. Remember that rest is an integral part of healthy pregnancy and staying fit.[25] You may find that you don’t have as much energy as you get closer to your due date.[26]\n\nIf you experience any vaginal bleeding or gushing fluid from your vagina, stop exercising immediately and contact your doctor.[27]\n\nStop exercising if you experience dizziness, headache, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, heart palpitations or uneven and rapid heartbeat, fluid leaking from your vagina, or decreased fetal movement.[28]",
                "Be aware of potentially risky activities. Consider avoiding certain activities that may be risky for a pregnant woman. This can help ensure you and your baby remain safe and healthy.[29]\n\nContact sports such as ice hockey, football, soccer, or basketball may not be safe, especially if you’ve never done any of these activities before you were pregnant.\nScuba diving is not recommended during pregnancy because it increases the risk of preterm birth and birth defects.[30]\n\nYou should also avoid any activity that poses a high risk of falling, including downhill skiing, gymnastics, water skiing, surfing, rock climbing, and horseback riding.[31]",
                "Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. As a pregnant woman, you need to make sure you are eating the proper nutrients to sustain healthy, fitness, and your pregnancy. By eating a healthy, well-balanced diet you can help ensure that you and your unborn baby get the necessary vitamins and minerals.\n\n\nIn addition to your regular calorie intake, you will need to factor in extra calories for sustaining your pregnancy. You will need up to 450 calories per day to support your unborn child.[32]\n\nEat healthy and nutrient dense foods such as lean proteins including chicken or beef, fruits and vegetables such as raspberries or broccoli, and dairy products like yogurt or cheese for calcium.[33]\n\nBe careful when consuming seafood or fish. Limit your cooked fish intake to 8 to 12 oz. per week and your canned intake to 6 oz. per week.[34] Avoid tuna steaks, swordfish, mackerel, shark or any other fish with high mercury levels.[35] However, there is no need to avoid low mercury fish, such as salmon.\nTry and avoid unhealthy calories such as those found in sweets and junk food.\nYou might want to avoid any foods that can cause digestive issues for you or your child, or unborn baby, including spicy foods, eggs, wheat, corn, or peanuts.[36] However, keep in mind that some research has suggested that this is not an effective way to prevent allergies.[37]\n\nIf you are suffering from nausea or vomiting due to either morning sickness and find it difficult to eat, consult your doctor or a registered dietician, who can help you find solutions to get proper nutrition.[38]",
                "Drink plenty of liquids. It’s important to make sure that you’re drinking plenty of liquids while pregnant. Not only do you need enough liquid to avoid dehydration and support your pregnancy, but you also need it to help maintain your fitness.\n\n\nYou should drink at least 15 cups of water a day to stay hydrated and sustain your pregnancy.[39]\n\nWater is the best choice for your needs, but you can also drink non-caffeinated tea, and juices. Clear, non-caffeinated soft drinks such as ginger ale may help with nausea.\nYou may consume coffee or caffeinated teas and soft drinks in limited quantities. Do not consume more than 200 mg of caffeine per day, which is about the same as two eight ounce cups of coffee.[40] Consult with your doctor to make sure it’s safe to consume any of these beverages.",
                "Avoid alcoholic beverages and tobacco. It’s advisable to avoid all alcohol and tobacco while you’re pregnant. Using these substances can be potentially harmful to you and your unborn baby and may undermine your efforts to stay fit.\n\n\nThere is plenty of evidence about the risk of alcohol consumption for pregnant women, so consider avoiding alcohol altogether while you’re pregnant.[41]\n\nTobacco use can put your unborn child at risk for conditions such as low-birth weight and respiratory diseases.[42]\n\nIf you smoke while pregnant, speak to your doctor about possible treatment options to help you quit and keep your unborn baby healthy.[43]",
                "Consider taking prenatal vitamins. Your body will need sufficient additional nutrients to support a pregnancy and stay fit. Consider taking a pre-natal vitamin to help you get additional nutrients you may need and not be getting through food.\n\n\nDuring pregnancy, the body is designed to put your child’s nutritional needs before yours.\nTry and get as many nutrients as possible from healthy and whole foods.\nMake sure to speak to your doctor before taking pre-natal vitamins or ask her to prescribe some for you."

        "wikiHow to Get Bug Bites to Stop Itching": {
            "intro": "Bug bites are really aggravating. Depending on what bit you, the bite might be red, swollen, itchy, or sting. You might realize you were bitten at the moment when it happened, or you might not discover the bite until hours later. With proper care, most bites are nothing more than an annoyance.",
            "steps": [
                "Cool the bite with a cold compress. The cold will reduce the swelling and numb the area a little bit. [1]\n\nIf you don't have an ice pack ready and waiting for use in the freezer, you can quickly make one by wrapping ice cubes or a package of frozen peas in a towel.\nBe careful not to hold the ice on your skin for too long. Limit it to 15 to 20 minutes at a time.",
                "Apply heat to the bite. If cold does not work to reduce the itching, try using heat. Heat can break down some of the chemicals in the bite that cause the itch, giving you relief.[2]\n\nHeat a spoon in boiling water. Hold it with a potholder so that you don't burn your hand.\nGently press the back of the spoon onto the bite. Hold it there for 15 seconds and then remove it. But be careful not to burn yourself!\nUse a blow drier to heat the bite and the area around the bite.",
                "Put essential oils on the bite. These methods have not been scientifically tested, but people have found them to be useful.[3]\n\nTea tree oil has antibacterial properties and will help prevent infection, as well as relieve itching, swelling and pain. Put a small drop on your finger or a clean cotton ball and then rub it directly onto the bite.\nTry other essential oils like lavender or coconut to reduce the itching and swelling. These also have the benefit that they will smell good.",
                "Use citrus juice or vinegar to stop the itching. The acid will help kill bacteria, prevent infection, promote healing and reduce the itching.\n\n\nLemon juice, lime juice and apple cider vinegar are common cooking ingredients that have high acidity.\nSoak the edge of a kitchen towel or napkin in the juice/vinegar and then dab it onto the bite until it is thoroughly coated.\nLet the juice/vinegar dry and reapply it whenever the itching starts again.",
                "Try raw honey. Honey will help reduce inflammation and the stickiness will make it less rewarding to scratch.\n\n\nClean the bite thoroughly with soap and water.\nSmear a quarter teaspoon of honey onto the bite and then let it sit.\nThe honey will be sticky, so be sure to keep the area clean so that dirt doesn't get stuck in the honey and transferred to the bite.",
                "Dry out the bite with a baking soda paste or toothpaste. This will draw out fluids and toxins, helping it to heal faster.\n\n\nMake a baking soda paste by mixing baking soda and water in a 2:1 ratio, then dab the mixture onto and around the bite. Let it dry completely before wiping it off. This will help dry out the bite and remove toxins.\nDab a pea-sized drop of toothpaste onto the bite and let it dry on the bite. Toothpaste is astringent and it will help draw out the fluids under your skin.",
                "Apply meat tenderizer to the bite. Meat tenderizer contains enzymes that break down proteins. This will help reduce the itching by breaking down chemicals in the bug's saliva which are in your skin. [4]\n\nDissolve the meat tenderizer in a small amount of water.\nDab the mixture directly onto the point where the bite occurred. You should get relief right away.\nLet it dry and then wash the meat tenderizer off with water.",
                "Rub aloe vera on the affected area. The aloe will have a cooling, soothing effect and is excellent for helping your skin heal.\n\n\nIf you have a commercially manufactured aloe vera gel, apply that generously over the bite and surrounding area.\nIf you have an aloe plant in your house, break off a leaf and split it open. Apply the gooey gel directly onto the bite.",
                "Raise the bitten area above your heart if possible. If the bite occurred on your arm or leg, raise the limb above your heart.\n\n\nTo be comfortable, try lying in bed and propping your arm or leg up on a pile of pillows.\nStay in this position for at least 30 minutes to give the swelling time to go down.",
                "Use an antihistamine to combat the allergic response. Insect bites itch because of the body's autoimmune reaction against the anticoagulants in the insect's saliva. This prevents your blood from clotting as the insect drinks. After the insect is gone, a small amount of the saliva remains in your skin.[5]\n\nUse a pea-sized amount of an antihistamine cream and smear it into the bite until it is fully absorbed.\nTake a non-sedating oral antihistamine such as 10 mg cetirizine once daily to help with symptoms. Use of both oral and topical antihistamines at the same time is not recommended.",
                "Apply a hydrocortisone cream to the bite to soothe the itchy, red, puffy skin around the bite. Hydrocortisone takes longer to start working, but once it does, the relief will last longer.[6]\n\n1% hydrocortisone creams can be purchased over the counter and will reduce the inflammation.\nPut a pea-sized amount on your finger and rub it into the bite until it soaks in completely.",
                "Dab calamine lotion on the bite. This will help draw out the fluids that have gathered under the skin making the bite puffy.[7] Lotions that pramoxine will also help.\n\n\nReapply the lotion according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lotion will dry out the bite and remove any chemicals from the bugs saliva that are irritating your skin.",
                "Use pain relieving medications as necessary. If the bite is painful and swollen, pain medications should help.\n\n\nPut a topical anesthetic on the bite to get immediate relief from the discomfort. A 2% Xylocaine Gel works well.[8]\n\nIf a topical pain reliever does not help, try an over the counter oral painkiller such as paracetamol (not available in the United States) or ibuprofen.[9]",
                "Remove the insect if it is still biting you. If you were bitten by a mosquito, chances are you noticed immediately when it bit you, and squashed it then. However, some insects like ticks, secrete an anesthetic in their saliva so the animal or person they bite won't feel it, enabling them to feed longer. It is very important to remove ticks as soon as possible, because this reduces the chances of getting a tick borne disease.[10]\n\nUse a tweezers to grip the tick as close as possible to your skin.[11]\n\nPull perpendicular to your skin with a steadily increasing pressure until the tick comes out. Don't twist or jerk the tick because this can cause the tick's body to break off from the head/mouth parts and leave them in your skin. You want to remove the whole tick.\nIf the head or mouth parts do remain in your skin, disinfect the tweezers with rubbing alcohol and remove them. If you cannot remove them yourself, have a doctor do it.\nDo not apply nail polish, petroleum jelly, or a smouldering match to the tick and then wait for it to detach on its own. To minimize the risks of tick borne diseases, you should remove it yourself as soon as possible.",
                "Wash the bite. This will clean the area, promote quick healing, and reduce the likelihood of it becoming infected.\n\n\nApply clean water and scrub the bite gently with a mild soap. This will prevent dirt and bacteria from getting into the wound and causing an infection.",
                "Use disinfectant to kill any bacteria or other pathogens. Put the disinfectant on a sterile cotton ball and then gently swab the bite. It may sting a little.The following chemicals have excellent germicidal properties and will work well.\n\n\nRubbing alcohol\nIodine scrub\nHydrogen peroxide[12]",
                "Apply a topical antibiotic to the bite to prevent the growth of bacteria. Triple antibiotic creams are available over the counter and are very effective. Always read and follow the instructions on the package. Consult a doctor before using these medications on infants or if you are pregnant.",
                "Don't scratch the bite. When you scratch you are irritating it and introducing bacteria into the bite with your fingers and fingernails. And, even worse, if you scratch it open, it will take longer to heal and is more likely to become infected.\n\n\nIf you have difficulty not scratching, try putting a band aid on it to cover it. This will remind you not to scratch and it will also prevent you from scratching in your sleep.",
                "Get medical help immediately if you develop a strange rash. Some insects carry serious diseases which have characteristic rashes.\n\n\nA red donut or bull's eye around a tick bite is a symptom of Lyme Disease and must be treated as soon as possible with antibiotics.[13]\n\nIf you develop a fever with a red or black spotty rash, see a doctor to be screened for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.",
                "Seek medical attention if you become sick after being bitten while traveling. Some insects carry diseases which do not produce rashes, but often come with flu-like symptoms. Insects carry different diseases in different parts of the world. So if you become sick after traveling and being bitten by insects, be sure to tell your doctor where you were traveling, that you were bitten, and what you symptoms are.[14] See a doctor if you develop any of the following symptoms:[15]\n\nFever\nHeadache\nDizziness\nJoint and muscle aches\nVomiting",
                "See a doctor immediately if you think you are having a systemic allergic reaction. An epinephrine injection will be administered immediately. Symptoms include:[16]\n\nHives or rashes spreading beyond the site of the bite\nItching or swelling in other parts of your body besides where you were bitten\nDifficulty breathing or wheezing\nDifficulty swallowing\nDizziness\nVomiting\nRacing heart",
                "Reduce the amount of skin you have exposed. By wearing long pants and long sleeves, you will reduce the amount of skin available to bite. While some insects like mosquitos can still bite through clothing, the number of bites you get will be reduced.",
                "Tuck your pants into your socks while hiking. This will protect you from ticks. After hiking, thoroughly check your entire body for ticks and promptly remove any you find.",
                "Spray bug repellents on your skin and clothing. The most effective sprays contain DEET (N, N-diethylmeta-toluamide) or picaridin and are widely available.[17] They will reduce mosquito, tick, and chigger bites.\n\n\nAvoid getting the spray in your eyes and do not inhale it\nDo not spray it into open wounds\nConsult with a doctor before using bug repellants if you are pregnant\nConsult with a doctor before using sprays on infants\nShower to wash the spray off your skin when you no longer need it.",
                "Sleep under a bug net if you are traveling and staying at a hotel where there are no screens on the windows. This will prevent you from getting bitten while you sleep.\n\n\nBe sure to check the net for holes",
                "Use Permethrin on clothing, bed nets, and camping gear. The protection should last through multiple washings.[18]",
                "Put flea and tick collars on pets. Be sure to check the collars regularly to prevent them from bringing fleas and ticks into the house. This can help keep pests out of your home.",
                "Don't leave pools of standing water near your house. Mosquitos breed in standing water, so emptying them will reduce the mosquito population."

        "wikiHow to Get Your Dog to Stop Playing Fetch With You": {
            "intro": "Many dog owners are jealous when they meet a dog that loves to play fetch. All dogs need exercise, and a chance to bond with their owner. That said, a ball-obsessed dog is not just an annoyance. If the drive to chase the ball is too strong, the dog may push itself past its limits and suffer from heatstroke or injured joints. Training is the best long-term solution for controlling a dog's fetching behavior.",
            "steps": [
                "Begin with basic training. Start here if your dog hasn't yet learned basic commands, such as \"Sit\" and \"Come.\" These are easy first commands to learn, because the dog can connect them to an obvious, immediate action. Train the dog in sessions no longer than 15 minutes at a time, using these techniques:[1]\n\nGet the dog's attention with a treat or toy.\nSay a short command (like \"Sit\") in a loud, clear voice. Say the command one time only, to teach the dog that he needs to respond right away.\nTo get the dog to sit, raise the treat above the dog's ahead, or gently press down on the hindquarters. For other commands, you may need to mimic what you want the dog to do, or wait until the dog does it accidentally.\nPraise the dog as soon as he obeys, and give the treat. Many dog owners use a clicker tool to make a sound that the dog will learn means a reward.",
                "Teach the dog to drop it. Once the dog knows a couple commands (at least Sit and Come), you can start teaching it good manners during fetch. The Drop It command is useful for dogs that won't let go of the ball or stick, even while they're begging for you to throw it again. Here's how to train this behavior:[2]\n\nGive the dog a toy to hold in its mouth. Choose one it likes to play fetch with.\nHold a small treat near its mouth. Pick something the dog likes, but not so much that it ignores the toy.\nWhen the dog lets go to eat the food, say \"Drop it\" and pick up the toy.\nRepeat until the dog starts opening its mouth as your hand approaches. When this happens, start saying \"Drop it\" before the toy is released.\nFinally (perhaps after several 5–15 minute sessions), leave out the food and reward the dog with praise instead.",
                "React to begging by starting a different form of play. When the dog tries to start a fetch session, throwing the ball will teach it that this method works. This isn't a problem for many dogs, but if yours wants to play fetch for 24 hours, deflect these requests with other activities. Take the dog outside instead, go for a jog, or give him a belly rub. Once the dog is distracted, get its attention and start a fetch session. This shows that you are the one who decides when to play fetch, not the dog.e yourself.",
                "Be firm when ending a play session. Don't let the dog determine when you play fetch. Watching her bark, whine, and jump isn't fun, but if you give in, she'll learn that it gets her what she wants.[3] Don't give in to \"one last throw\" after you decide to end it.\n\n\nA stern \"That's enough\" or \"No play\" command can teach some dogs to stop bothering you.[4] This is more difficult to train, since you can only use the command while the dog is misbehaving. Try an additional signal, such as clapping your hands, to reinforce the idea.\nWhen playing outdoors, end the play session by putting on the leash and walking calmly back inside or to the car.",
                "Stick to a schedule if necessary. Some \"ball-obsessed\" dogs, including many retrievers, have trouble resisting the extreme drive to play fetch. If you've tried training for two or three weeks and you aren't happy with the results, start a fetch schedule. Play fetch only at certain times of day, in five minute sessions — or longer sessions with a break every five minutes.[5] If you regularly visit a dog park or other play area, consider only playing fetch during those visits.\n\n\nThe more structured the play session is, the more likely the dog is to learn how it works. Try starting each session by saying \"Playtime!,\" and giving the dog a set of commands: \"Sit,\" \"Stay,\" \"Fetch,\" \"Come,\" \"Drop It.\"",
                "Hide the ball. If you don't want to play fetch, take the ball or other thrown object and hide it. Do this when the dog isn't looking, and place the ball somewhere the dog can't see it.\n\n\nIf your dog want to play fetch constantly (and is getting adequate exercise), keep the ball hidden. Only take it out during playtime.\nWhen outside, hold the ball on the side opposite the dog, or hide it in a bag.",
                "Distract the dog. Try this of the dog won't obey a \"drop it\" command, or won't stop harassing you. Show the dog a treat and toss it next to him. Toss another treat a few feet (couple meters) away. When the dog goes for it, grab the ball and hide it.\n\n\nThis is best used when you're looking after another person's dog and urgently need cooperation. If this is your own dog, training it is the better long term option.",
                "Get a mechanical thrower. These devices automatically launch tennis balls across your backyard or hallway. If your dog is bored or doesn't get enough exercise, this could be a good solution.\n\n\nKeep an eye on the dog the first few times it plays. Make sure the thrower doesn't launch the ball hard enough to hurt the dog.\nSeveral short play sessions a day are healthier than one long play session. Puppies and old dogs are especially vulnerable to injury, and should stop after five minutes to catch their breath and drink water."

            "intro": "A website can generate business while raising visibility, which could make your organization appear both more polished and professional. A well designed website can provide potential customers with information about your business, including products, services, and past accomplishment, as well. This can save your company both time and money, making a business website a crucial part of your business strategy.",
            "steps": [
                "Be specific with your goals from the outset.[1] This will help you to target your audience with greater accuracy. If you know that the goal of your website is to provide clear and engaging information about your company's services, you will be able to make use of specific strategies, like interactive info-graphics, that accomplish your goal best. Some goals include:\n\n\nEstablishing an online presence.\nProviding customers information more efficiently.\nGenerating sales through an online store.\nBlogging to engage client base.[2]",
                "Set a budget.[3] Developing a polished, comprehensive website can be a costly endeavor. Most competent web developers will charge around $1,500 per website, charging less or more depending on the features and particulars of your site.[4] Setting a budget can also help you determine:\n\n\nWhether or not to use a web designer.\nWhether or not to hire a copywriter.\nHow much you will be able to spend on site optimization features, like content management systems.",
                "Research domain names and providers.[5] Your domain name is the name that users type into the search bar of their web browser to search for and find your website.[6] You'll want a domain that is both catchy, simple, and related in some way to your business. This way your customers can remember it easily and search it online when ready. When you've decided on your domain, you'll need to check that its available with a domain provider. Some common domain providers are:\n\n\n1&1\nDomain.com\nGoDaddy\nName.com\nNameCheap.com[7][8]",
                "Decide whether you want to go it alone or hire a developer.[9] Many domain providers now include tools to help new users create a simple website for themselves. If you are a small business owner still evaluating his need for a website, a self-made one might be the most affordable option.",
                "Think about the host for your website.[10] Unless you are extremely tech savvy or have an entire IT department helping you with the process, hosting your own site can be costly.[11] If this is your case, you'll need to do some Internet research on external web hosts to find which is best for your situation. The three basic types of web host are:\n\n\nShared - space for your website is shared on a server with other website owners.\nDedicated - an entire server is committed and maintained solely by you for your website needs.\nCollocated - you own and maintain a server that is kept in facilities owned by a web host.[12]",
                "Imagine the final product in detail. You'll need to know what color scheme your website will use, along with its basic layout and content.[13] After all, you'll need to build your site around features like a weekly blog or monthly specials. Try to use the structure of your site to draw attention to these special features and offers.\n\n\nThink about ways you might tie in existing designs your business uses, like a logo, emblem, or watermark.",
                "Purchase your domain name and enlist with your provider. This is a fairly simple process that involves first checking to see if your domain name is available. Usually, this is done through the domain provider you have decided on purchasing your domain through. Once your domain name is verified as available, you'll have to pay the agreed upon cost for your domain, usually for a specified length of time.\n\n\n24/7 technical support can save your business money in the event of a failure on the provider side of things.",
                "Implement your design decisions. If you are working with a web designer, you should set up weekly or bi-weekly meetings where you can give feedback on the website and hear your designer's opinions as well. You might well find, after beginning the design process, that you need to:\n\n\nLimit flashy graphics and distracting features, like flash animation.\nRestructure your site to guide users through it more organically.\nReduce the words in your copy to make it more concise and to the point.",
                "Include information about executive members and management.[14] People oftentimes feel at a disadvantage when dealing with faceless, inhuman companies. You can put your customers at ease while giving a face to your brand by including a blurb about your management team or executive members.[15]",
                "Keep the next step in mind. While building your website, always think of what customers will be looking for next and how you might help them find that.[16] For example, if you own a physical store, you'll likely want your hours of operation clearly visible on your homepage. You also might:\n\n\nHave clear links on your homepage to the purpose of your website (store, product information, map, etc.).",
                "Test your website before you launch it.[17] Failure to launch a site properly can result in a negative kind of publicity that turns customers off because your web service was poorly functioning. This can hurt your image as a competent, reliable business person, but can be avoided by:\n\n\nHaving associates and colleagues look at the pre-release version.\nAllowing a small group, like a pool of employees or family members, to stress test the website.",
                "Add your site to search engine directories. Online search engines, like Google and Yahoo, are essentially directories of websites on the Internet.[18] If your website is not registered with these search engines, you might be missed in a general web search and lose customers. Add your website at:\n\n\nwww.google.com/addurl/\nwww.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url\nsearch.yahoo.com/info/submit.html",
                "Update your content regularly.[19] Information that is quite obviously years out of date will not inspire confidence in your clientele. Have a plan of attack for the development of your site's content, including ways you can keep your site engaging and fresh to site users. You should regularly:\n\n\nUpdate personal information.\nUpdate product information.\nList specials and sales.\nInclude related content, like market advances or new technology.",
                "Hire a copywriter, if suitable for your situation. If you find writing reliable, informative, and grammatically correct content (often referred to as \"copy\") for your website difficult, you may want to hire a writer to assist.[20] You'll need to decide on either hiring a freelance writer or a contract writer. Some common sites you might investigate en route to finding the right writer:\n\n\nBlogging Pro Job Board\nCopywriter Jobs Central\nElance\noDesk",
                "Manage your site content with a content management system.[21] The right system will make it a cinch for you or your employees to post new content to your website without having to use HTML code. Some providers, like GoDaddy, include this service, but you might want to look into:\n\n\nDrupal\nExpression engine\nRubedo[22]",
                "Incorporate social media in your site.[23] Today's user is likely to also be a consumer of social media, like Twitter and Facebook, and by incorporating these features in your site, you can improve your connection with your clients. You can also use social media to post specials and site updates, potentially earning you clicks and better traction.",
                "Email your business contacts with specials and new information.[24] Strategic timing of emails, like right before your busy season, can gain you business that might have otherwise been missed.[25] You should also think about:\n\n\nA monthly newsletter, informing clients of updates and news.\nMonthly messages about deals and sales."

            "intro": "Spiders and scorpions are pesky intruders that belong outside. They make houses dirtier by building webs and nests, and some can even be dangerous with poisonous bites and painful stings. Needless to say, you probably don’t consider them welcome guests in your home. With a little effort and regular cleaning, you can keep spiders and scorpions out of your house by spraying natural repellents and using other natural remedies.",
            "steps": [
                "Purchase essential oils. Essential oils, while quite pleasant smelling to humans, have been proven very useful in repelling spiders and scorpions. The smells can be overwhelming to their sensitive senses and keep them from infiltrating the area.[1]\n\nSome of the most effective essential oils in combating spiders and scorpions include peppermint, tea tree, neem, and citrus.\nSome recommend lavender for use in repelling spiders and scorpions, but results are mixed. It’s probably best to focus your essential oil purchases on peppermint, citrus, neem, or tea tree.",
                "Make a spray. Create your own spider and scorpion repellant by making a spray to use around your home. In a clean spray bottle, combine 5-7 drops of essential oils (you can use peppermint, lavender, tea tree, or citrus) with some warm water.[2]\n\nSpray the mixture around your home, focusing specifically on areas that spiders and scorpions prefer like under furniture, in corners, around mounted light fixtures, and other out-of-the-way spaces.\nYou can also add a teaspoon of white vinegar or eco-friendly dish soap to make the mixture additionally effective.",
                "Use diatomaceous earth. Diatomaceous earth is an inexpensive powder composed of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a kind of algae. It works as a repellant for spiders and scorpions (and other bugs) by absorbing all of the moisture out of its surroundings, including the unwanted pests infesting your home. This causes the spiders and scorpions to dehydrate and die.[3]\n\nSimply sprinkle the diatomaceous earth around areas where you notice the pests – under furniture, in the cellar, and around windowsills.\nMake sure you purchase the food-grade diatomaceous earth to ensure that it is safe for use in your home.",
                "Wipe down surfaces. Place a few drops of eco-friendly dish soap on a paper towel or sponge and wipe down some of the surfaces in your home. Pay special attention to difficult to reach places like the tops of cabinets, ceiling fans, and the backs of mantles or shelves.[4]\n\nAlternatively, you can use a few drops of vinegar or essential oils to wipe down the surfaces in your home to repel spiders and scorpions.",
                "Invest in some eco-friendly dish soap. Dish soap has long been used in the fight against scorpion and spider home invasions. Keeping your counters wiped down with eco-friendly dish soap will go a long way in protecting your home from spider and scorpion invaders.[5]\n\nWhile regular dish soap may include some unsavory chemicals that you don’t want to go smearing all over your house, most eco-friendly versions are readily available and contain more natural ingredients.\nWhen choosing eco-friendly dish soaps, make sure you steer clear of harsh, potentially toxic preservatives. Instead check the label for paraben-free preservatives like methylisothiazolinone, benzisothiazolinone, or phenoxyethanol.",
                "Clean with vinegar. The strong smell of vinegar works very effectively at repelling scorpions and spiders. The acidic makeup of the vinegar makes these pests want to avoid coming anywhere near it. Pour a few drops of vinegar on a paper towel or sponge and wipe down your counters and other surfaces in your home.[6]\n\nYou should use white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or malt vinegar for best results.",
                "Focus on barriers to the outdoors. When using the spray or wipe down method, be sure to focus on any regions that could provide access to your home from the outdoors. Spray or wipe down baseboards, windowsills, and the casings of all doors that lead outside.[7]\n\nThese areas are the places where spiders and scorpions enter your home. So if you make them unappealing to the pests, they may retreat and stay away from your house.",
                "Dust your home regularly. Scorpions and spiders thrive in dusty corners and unused spaces that accumulate dirt. One of the easiest ways to keep your home free of these invaders is to dust the surfaces of your home regularly. Try to thoroughly dust your home once every week or so, with extra in-depth dusting once per month.[8]\n\nYou can use one of those long-handled feather dusters for the hard-to-reach areas of your home.\nMake sure to get the tops of cabinets, ceiling fan blades, baseboards, and remove any cobwebs that might have appeared around the ceiling and air vents.",
                "Vacuum. Use your vacuum once every week or so to vacuum your entire house. This will help eliminate the creation of dirty floor areas for spiders and scorpions to hide in. Vacuum the floors thoroughly, making sure to cover the entire space – even the corners of rooms and on the stairs.[9]\n\nIf you don’t have carpet, you can consider sweeping or mopping to clean the floors instead.\nRemember to move furniture so that you can vacuum under it. Spiders and scorpions love the dusty areas under couches and coffee tables.",
                "Organize your storage spaces. Spiders and scorpions love to hide in undisturbed, out-of-the-way parts of your home. Some of the most common places to find these little pests are in spaces that you use for storage – like the top shelf of your bathroom cabinet, the bottom of your closet, or that drawer in the kitchen you use for all of your miscellaneous junk. Try organizing these spaces so that there is less clutter, giving spiders and scorpions fewer hidey holes to get comfy in.[10]\n\nUse plastic storage bins with sealable lids to store and organize various items in your closet.\nThrow away things you don’t use – such as old bottles of perfume and lotion in the bathroom, old makeup supplies, or old kitchen utensils – to minimize the clutter and create more usable, open space.",
                "Seal cracks. In order to keep spiders and scorpions out of your home, you’ll need to minimize their access to the interior of your house. This means sealing up any exposed cracks that could offer them entry to your home. Use caulk and a caulk gun to fill in any cracks you see in your walls – inside or outside.[11]\n\nYou can purchase caulk at any home improvement store.\nMake sure you get the caulking material fully inside the entire crack.\nLet it dry completely before touching it. This usually takes about 24 hours.",
                "Use cedar chips. Scorpions are naturally repelled by the scent of cedar oil. So a great way to keep them out of your yard and away from your home is by spreading cedar chips around your yard.[12]\n\nYou should be able to purchase cedar chips at any home improvement or garden store.\nSimply sprinkle the cedar chips around your yard – in flowerbeds, around the base of your house, along sidewalks, around the perimeter of your fence, etc.",
                "Remove debris from around your home. Another major thing that attracts spiders and scorpions is a messy yard with lots of places to hide. Once the pests are in your yard, it won’t be long before they start infiltrating your home. Maintaining your outdoor space will help prevent spiders and scorpions from getting inside your house.[13]\n\nRake up leaves quickly, remove tall grasses and weeds, and keep necessary outdoor storage (sheds, stacks of firewood, etc.) as far from your actual house as possible."

        "wikiHow to Recycle Envelopes With Plastic Windows": {
            "intro": "Recycling is available in most communities throughout the industrial world. However, the guidelines for recycling differ greatly based on the material and the location. As recycling plants develop new ways to sift and render plastic, paper, glass, cardboard and more, there are more things that can be recycled. One of the most common items used in personal and business mail is an envelope. Many envelopes are made of paper that can be recycled with other mixed or white paper. Other envelopes have plastic windows to show recipient addresses, which can be recycled, reused and reduced. This article will tell you how to recycle envelopes with plastic windows.",
            "steps": [
                "Call your recycling service to ask if they recycle envelopes with plastic windows. If you have a service that picks up your recycling every week or month, you can call their number. If you take your recycling to a location, then check with the people inside the building the next time you take other recycling.\n\n\nIf you are in an office, ask your office manager how the company handles recycling. Some companies view envelopes as confidential materials and would prefer envelopes with plastic windows to be shredded.\nYou can offer to do research about local recycling agencies, if your office does not currently recycle. Some cities and states offer incentives to offices that are looking to become more \"green.\"",
                "Research local recycling options, if you do not currently recycle. You can usually look in the local yellow pages to find recycling centers or call your local chamber of commerce. They may offer a booklet with trash and recycling information to residents.\n\n\nSmall towns usually have limited recycling options. You can drive to a local recycle drop off or call a larger city nearby that may recycle more. Medium-sized towns may have private services that offer monthly fee-based roadside pickups. Large towns and suburbs may have trash and recycling services as part of the city services. If that is the case, there is probably a list on the city website that will tell you what is recyclable.",
                "Place your envelopes with plastic windows with the other paper recycling, if your recycling agency suggests. Most recycling centers have a way to filter out the plastic window from the envelope and paper.",
                "Remove the plastic window from the inside, if your recycling agency cannot separate the plastic and glue from the envelope. You will need to throw away the plastic and glue, and place the envelope with the other paper recycling.",
                "Update your accounts to use online statements. Many of the documents that arrive in the window envelopes are from banks, utility companies and junk mail distributors. It is faster for large companies to print out your address on the letter and avoid using mailing labels.",
                "Contact an opt-out organization in your country to remove your address from receiving junk mail. Although this may not stop all direct mail cards and envelopes, it can greatly reduce the number. You can also call the company directly to stop correspondence.\n\n\nIf you live in the UK, go to the Mail Preference System, MPSonline.org.uk in order to stop unsolicited direct mail.\nIf you live in the US, you can go to the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference System, DMAchoice.org. You can pay a $1 processing fee, in order to stop mail solicitations from a number of national companies for 5 years. You may need to contact some credit card and catalog companies directly to stop solicitations.\nIf you live in Canada, go to Red Dot Campaign's site, www.RedDotCampaign.ca to stop junk mail. It will give you directions on how to contact the Canada Post in your area. Stopping junk mail may differ depending upon your province.",

            "intro": "Getting a new dog, especially a dog as wonderful as a Lhasa apso, can be tremendously exciting. Whether you are getting an energetic puppy or a wonderful older dog, your life will be enhanced by having it around.[1] However, you will need to figure a lot of things out in order raise a dog that is healthy and happy. Take the time to figure out how to take care of your dog, so that it can more easily become an important and loved part of your family. As a dog owner, you will need to feed, groom, train, and take care of the health of your dog, at the very least.",
            "steps": [
                "Feed your dog quality food. Lhasa apsos, like other dogs, usually eat 1-2 times a day, depending on how you want to space out their meals. Choose a dog food that is low in grains and high in protein, as a dog is naturally carnivorous.[2]\n\nFollow the suggestions on the food packaging when determining how much food to feed your Lhasa. This suggestion is usually based on the dog's weight and how old they are.\nConsult with your veterinarian if you have questions about your dog's diet. They should have good suggestions about appropriate amounts to feed your dog and what brands might fit your dog's particular dietary needs best.",
                "Don't overfeed your pet. It can be hard to resist a cute Lhasa face when it is begging for a little treat. However, for the health of the dog, resist giving it too many calories.\n\n\nIf you do want to give your dog treats, reserve the treats for training sessions. That way your dog will get the satisfaction of a treat and a new skill at the same time.",
                "Give access to water at all times.[3] No matter what type of dog you have, you should make sure that it always has access to water. Dehydration can occur quickly and it is inhumane to put a dog through that due to negligence.",
                "Brush your dog. Try using a double sided brush, one with separated pins on one side and the other with nice smooth bristles. This will give you several options for different areas of the coat. Also, remember to brush with the direction of hair growth, so that you don't tangle the coat further.\n\n\nRemember to brush your Lhasa at least weekly or its coat can get terribly tangled.",
                "Get your Lhasa's coat cut. Lhasa apsos are naturally long haired, but can have short hair, often called a \"puppy cut.\"[4] Either way, they will need to get a cut on a regular basis, unlike short-haired dogs whose fur falls out. Decide which cut you like best and take your Lhasa to a groomer to get the cut.\n\n\nIf you like a challenge, you can groom your dog yourself. However, this takes quite a bit of skill so you may want to do some research and have some practice before you decide to do a full grooming yourself.\nA \"puppy cut\" is easier to care for and cooler for the dog. Consider getting your dog a \"puppy cut\" if you are having a hard time keeping up with brushing or your dog is getting overheated.",
                "Trim your dog's nails and check its ears. These things do not need to be done as often as brushing your dog's coat, but they should be done on a regular basis.[5] Taking the time to assess your dog's feet and ears is a good way to bond with the dog and keep track of its general physical health.\n\n\nTrim your Lhasa's nails down but do not cut the quick of the nail, where the nail is alive, or this will be painful for the dog and it may bleed.\nBegin cleaning your dog's ears by looking in them for dirt and debris. If you see it, clean it out with a dry, soft cloth. Also look for infections or mites, which should be treated by a veterinarian.",
                "Brush your Lhasa's teeth regularly. Like other dogs, a Lhasa apso's teeth should be brushed with dog toothpaste on a regular basis to avoid tooth decay. In fact, brushing your dog's teeth can be a good training exercise and it will help freshen its breath as well.[6]\n\nTo get your dog used to a tooth brushing, you need to introduce the process gradually. Start with some dog toothpaste and let the dog lick it off your finger. Then, the next day, try sticking the toothpaste on your finger in its mouth. Gradually work up to the toothpaste on a doggie toothbrush and putting it onto the dog's teeth.\nIt can take some time to get a dog acclimated to tooth brushing. So, don't worry if your dog has a hard time with it. Just keep trying.\nDo not use toothpaste made for humans. It can be toxic for dogs. Instead, you should get toothpaste for dogs, which is available online or at your local pet store.",
                "Socialize your dog early. Lhasa apsos can be suspicious of strangers, so it's good to get them used to a variety of people and places early in life. This includes other dogs. Socializing a Lhasa apso well can minimize that instinct.[7]\n\nLhasa apsos that are not socialized very well can get very jealous with other dogs. Keep your dog away from other dogs until you are sure that it can interact with other dogs without getting aggressive.",
                "Train your Lhasa to follow basic commands. All dogs should be trained to sit, stay, come, lay down, and heel. A well trained dog is a joy to have in your home and your bond with the dog will be stronger if you have a clear understanding about the expectations you have for your dog.\n\n\nThis training can take some time but it is worth the effort.",
                "Train your dog to go to the bathroom outside. This is an important training process so that the dog knows where and when to go to the bathroom and so that it does not have accidents in the house. Potty training can take some time, especially with a stubborn dog like a Lhasa apso, so take your time and try to be patient.[8] With enough work and consistency, your dog will get the hang of it.\n\n\nSome pet owners use \"pee pads\" so that a dog can go to the bathroom inside. If you want to do this, you will still need to train the dog to go on the pad and not other places in your home.",
                "Be vigilant and consistent about training. Some Lhasa's are stubborn and difficult to train. However, if you are consistent and unwilling to give up, your dog will be more likely to learn to follow your commands.\n\n\nLhasas often are not motivated to listen to humans or follow their directions. Because of this, make sure you have a small treat to use for training, as this will make the dog more likely to pay attention to you.",
                "Take the dog for regular veterinary checkups. This is very important in order to keep your Lhasa in tip top shape. Your veterinarian will make sure that the dog is up to date on its vaccinations and that its general health is fine.\n\n\nLhasa apsos do not really suffer from many hereditary diseases, however they can have problems with their kidneys.[9] Have your Lhasa screened for renal dysplasia so that you can start treatment before an issue becomes serious.",
                "Give your dog regular exercise. Even though a Lhasa apso does not require as much exercise as a working dog, for instance, that does not mean that it doesn't require any exercise. Walk and play with him or her often. In fact, Lhasa apsos enjoy daily walks and regular play times.[10]\n\nMake sure your dog is on a leash for walks. Lhasas can be very interested in strangers and new areas, so if off leash it may wonder off.",
                "Be affectionate to your dog. As a dog, the thing it needs most is love. This love can be shown by playing with your dog, going to the dog park, playing inside, or just snuggling on the couch. However you like to spend time with your dog, do it.\n\n\nJust be sure to give it enough attention so that it doesn't get depressed due to loneliness.\nHowever, Lhasa apso are usually ok if you leave them at home while you go to work. They do not usually get separation anxiety like some other breeds do.[11]"

        "How to Look After a Sprained Wrist": {
            "intro": "A sprained wrist is an injury to the ligaments that connect the small bones of the wrist (called carpal bones) together. The most common ligament injured in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone.[1] Wrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch or tearing to the ligament. The severity of your wrist sprain will dictate how you look after it at home or whether you need to see a health professional.",
            "steps": [
                "Rest your wrist and be patient. Minor wrist sprains are often caused by repetitive tasks or hyperextending the joint by falling on an outstretched hand.[2] Take a break from repetitive tasks if that's what you think led to your wrist injury. Talk to your boss about switching to a different activity for a week or so. If the sprain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.\n\n\nA mild wrist strain is often categorized as a Grade I sprain, which implies that ligaments are stretched a little too far, but not significantly.[3]\n\nTolerable pain, mild inflammation or swelling, and some loss of movement and/or strength in the wrist are common symptoms of Grade I wrist sprains.",
                "Ice your sprained wrist. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including wrist sprains.[4] Apply the ice to the most tender part of your wrist in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every 2-3 hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.\n\n\nCompressing the ice against your wrist with an elastic wrap will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your hand and wrist.\nAlways wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.",
                "Use a basic wrist support. Wrapping your wrist in an Ace or tensor bandage, surgical tape, or a simple neoprene wrist support will offer a small degree of joint support and allow you to compress ice to your wrist easier, but the biggest benefit is likely psychological — essentially it's a visual reminder to take it easy with your wrist for a short period of time.[5]\n\nWrap your wrist from your knuckles all the way up to the middle of your forearm, overlapping the elastic wrap as you go.[6]\n\nThe wrist wrap, tape or neoprene wrist support should be snug, but not cutting off your circulation — make sure your hand doesn't turn blue, get cold or start to tingle.",
                "Do some light wrist stretches. After the pain and inflammation have subsided, do some light stretches if your wrist feels stiff. Mild strains and sprains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves tension, promotes blood flow and increases flexibility.[7] In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and do them 3-5x daily until the mobility returns to your wrist.\n\n\nYou can stretch both wrists at the same time by forming the \"prayer pose\" with your hands (the palms of both hands together in front of your face with your elbows bent). Put pressure against your hands by raising the level of your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your injured wrist. Check with your doctor, trainer, or physical therapist for more wrist stretches if needed.\nConsider applying some moist heat to your wrist prior to stretching it — it will make the tendons and ligaments more pliable.",
                "Take an over-the-counter medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with significant pain or inflammation in your wrist.[8] Keep in mind that these drugs can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. Do not give aspirin to children under 18\n\n\nTalk to your doctor before starting new medications if you have medical problems, take medications, or have allergies to medications.\nAlternatively, you can rub a pain relieving cream or gel directly into your sore wrist.\nKeeping your wrist elevated can also help reduce swelling.\nModerate wrist sprains, usually called Grade II sprains, involve significant pain, inflammation and often bruising due to ligament tearing.\nGrade II wrist sprains may feel more unstable and lead to more hand weakness than Grade I wrist sprains.",
                "Be more diligent with icing. A moderate or Grade II wrist sprain involves greater swelling because ligament fibers are torn, although it's not completely severed.[9] As such, you'll need to be more diligent with your icing routine in addition to taking some anti-inflammatory medication. The sooner you can apply cold therapy to a Grade II sprain the better, because blood vessels will contract in diameter and restrict blood flow and subsequent swelling. For a more serious sprain, ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every hour for the initial day or two, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.\n\n\nIf you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer — peas or corn works great.",
                "Wear a wrist splint or brace. Since instability and weakness is more of a concern with a Grade II wrist sprain, a more supportive wrist splint or brace should be worn.[10] A splint or brace is not primarily psychological, as it will restrict movement (immobilize) and offer substantial support if you need to use your hand for something.\n\n\nCheck with your doctor on which type of splint or brace is recommended.\nMake sure you position your wrist in a neutral position when your tighten the wrist splint or brace.\nGrade II sprains may need to be immobilized with a brace or splint for 1-2 weeks, which can result in stiffness and reduced range of motion when you take it off.[11]",
                "Plan on some rehabilitation. Once your Grade II wrist sprain starts to heal after a few weeks, you may need some rehabilitation to gain back your strength and mobility. You can do this at home or you can see a physical therapist, who will show you specific and tailored strengthening exercises for your wrist and hand.[12]\n\nTo build strength once your wrist feels better, try squeezing a ball: with your arm outstretched and your palm facing up, squeeze a rubber ball (a racquetball works well) with your fingers for 30 seconds at a time and repeat 10-20x per day.[13]\n\nOther activities that will help build strength in your wrist include lifting light weights, bowling, playing racket sports and working in your yard (pulling weeds etc.). Don't start these types of activities until your doctor or therapist tells you to do so.",
                "See your doctor. In instances of significant wrist trauma that leads to severe pain, swelling, bruising, and/or loss of hand function, it's best to see your family physician or emergency department immediately so that the correct diagnosis can be made. Grade III wrist sprains involve completely severed ligaments, which will need surgery to repair.[14] Other serious wrist conditions that your doctor should consider are fractures, dislocations, inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout), carpal tunnel syndrome, infection and severe tendonitis.\n\n\nX-rays, bone scans, MRI and nerve conductance studies are modalities that your doctor may use to help diagnose your wrist issue. Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or gout.\nYou should also see your doctor if you still have symptoms after treating a sprain at home for more than 2 weeks or if the symptoms are getting worse.\nOther symptoms that many be signs of a fracture include significant swelling, bruising, tenderness, deformity, and causes of the injury like falling onto your wrist and sports injuries.\nChildren tend to have more fractures than sprains of the wrist.",
                "See a chiropractor or osteopath. Chiropractors and osteopaths are joint specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the spinal and peripheral joints, including the wrist. If your wrist sprain primarily involves a jammed or slightly dislocated carpal bone, then the chiropractor / osteopath will use manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, to unjam or reposition the affected joint. You can often hear a \"popping\" or \"cracking\" sound with an adjustment.\n\n\nAlthough a single adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your wrist pain and restore full range of motion, more than likely it will take a few treatments to notice significant results.\nWrist adjustments are not appropriate for wrist fractures, infections or inflammatory arthritis.",
                "Talk to your doctor about a wrist injection. An injection of steroid medication near or into a ligament, tendon or joint can quickly reduce inflammation and allow normal, pain-free movement of your wrist again.[15] Cortisone injections are only indicated for serious or chronic wrist sprains. The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.\n\n\nPotential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage.\nIf corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution for your wrist, then surgery should be considered.",
                "Talk to your doctor about wrist surgery. Surgery for chronic wrist pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other noninvasive therapies are proven ineffective, although if you experience a traumatic Grade III sprain, then surgery will be your first option to repair the severed ligaments.[16] Wrist surgery involves reconnecting the severed ligament to the associated carpal bone, sometimes with pins or plates for stabilization.\n\n\nWrist ligament surgery takes from 6-8 weeks to heal, although several months of rehabilitation may be needed to regain normal strength and range of motion[17]\n\nPossible complications from wrist surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis and chronic swelling / pain."

        "wikiHow to Grow Turnips": {
            "intro": "Turnips are a relatively low maintenance crop that can usually be harvested after five to ten weeks, and you can harvest both the root of the vegetable and its greens. Start from seed and plan on growing your turnips in the spring or fall.",
            "steps": [
                "Plant in the spring or fall. Turnips thrive in cooler temperatures, so you should plant them when soil temperatures are still somewhat cool. For spring turnips, sow the seeds outdoors three weeks before the last expected frost. For fall turnips, sow the seeds in midsummer, roughly two months before the first expected frost of winter.[1]\n\nThe soil temperature needs to be an average of at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) for the seeds to germinate, but temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees (10 and 21 degrees Celsius) Fahrenheit encourage the most rapid growth.\nFall turnips are typically sweeter than spring turnips, and they are also less likely to attract root maggots.",
                "Choose a good location. Turnips thrive in full sun, so the area you choose should receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily, if not a little more.\n\n\nIdeally, you should also choose a spot with naturally loose, well-draining soil. You can improve the soil conditions if necessary, but starting out with good soil conditions will make your job easier.\nAlso keep in mind that turnips prefer soils with a pH of 6.5. Most soils will not be too acidic or too alkaline, so testing is not always necessary. If you have difficulty with your turnip crop, though, consider testing the soil pH by taking a sample to your nearest university or by purchasing a home pH testing kit from a garden nursery or home improvement store.",
                "Improve the soil conditions. Loosen the soil with a rake or shovel to a depth of 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm), then mix in a 2-inch to 4-inch (5-cm to 10-cm) layer of compost.[2]\n\nFor added benefit, consider mixing in a few handfuls of well rotted manure along with the compost.",
                "Scatter the seeds. Spread the seed across the prepared soil as evenly as possible. Cover the seed gently with 1/4 inch (6 mm) of soil for spring turnips or 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of soil for fall turnips.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can plant the seeds in rows spaced 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart.\nNote that germination usually takes anywhere from 7 to 14 days.\nAfter planting the seeds, make sure that they are evenly watered. You do not want to drench the seeds since doing so can wash them out of the soil, but the surface of the soil should be somewhat moist to the touch.",
                "Thin out the seedlings. When the seedlings reach a height of 4 inches (10 cm), pull the weakest ones so that the strongest have more room and resources. \"Early\" varieties should be thinned out so that they are 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart, while standard or “maincrop” varieties should be 6 inches (15 cm) apart.\n\n\nIf you only want to grow turnips for their greens, however, you should not thin them out.\nUsually, the greens of the removed plants are large enough to use.",
                "Water as needed. Turnips need 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. Any less will cause the roots to become tough and bitter, but too much more can cause the turnips to rot.\n\n\nMonitor the rainfall in your area. During seasons of average rainfall, you may not need to do any additional watering. If the season is a dry one, though, you should water the turnips by hand.",
                "Add plenty of mulch. When the plants reach a height of 5 inches (12.7 cm), add a 2-inch (5-cm) layer of mulch around the greens.\n\n\nMulch holds in moisture, and even moisture can encourage better growth and flavor.\nAdditionally, mulch can help control and limit the number of weeds in your garden.",
                "Consider fertilizing the turnips. While not strictly necessary, a monthly application of mild, organic fertilizer can help strengthen the turnip root. Choose a fertilizer high in potassium and phosphorus rather than one high in nitrogen.[3]\n\nNitrogen fertilizers will cause the turnip greens to get very bushy, but the roots will suffer as a result.\nLook for fertilizers that also contain boron or apply a separate boron spray four to six weeks after sowing the seeds.\nMake sure that any fertilizer you use is food-safe.\nInstead of a fertilizer, you could apply a dose of compost tea once a month or so.",
                "Remove any weeds. Any weeds that poke their way up through the mulch should be pulled by hand. Avoid using herbicides since the chemicals can get on the turnip plant, damaging it and making it unfit for human consumption.",
                "Watch out for pests and fungi. Root maggots and flea beetles are among the most common pests you'll need to worry about, while powdery mildew and downy mildew tend to be the most common forms of fungi.\n\n\nRoot maggots are most often a problem when you grow turnips in soil that nurtured radishes, turnips, or rutabagas the previous year. To prevent root maggot infestations, rotate your crops and treat the soil with a food-safe insecticide labeled for use against root maggots.\nKeeping the soil pH above 6.0 can prevent most problems with mildew and other fungi, like club root. Periodically test the soil pH with a pH testing kit or by taking it to a local university extension office.[4]\n\nTypically speaking, once turnip roots become infested by pests or fungi, there is not much you can do to save them. Your best option is to remove the infected plant and treat the soil as needed to destroy as much of the pest or fungi as possible. You may or may not be able to recover the rest of your turnip crop.",
                "Harvest the greens early on. As a general rule, you can harvest greens as soon as they are large enough to pick. Generally, this is when the green reach a height between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).[5]\n\nAs long as the growing points or nodes are not removed, the greens should regrow after harvesting them.\nIf you want to harvest leaves and roots from the same plant, only remove two or three leaves per plant. If you remove all of the leaves, the root will die.",
                "Pull turnips roots once they mature. You should be able to harvest mature, ripe turnips after five to ten weeks. \"Early\" varieties only require five weeks, while main crop varieties need six to ten.\n\n\nYou can harvest small turnips simply by hand pulling them. To harvest large turnip roots, use a spading fork to loosen the soil around the root before pulling it out.\nYou can harvest turnips at virtually any size. Small turnips are tender and tend to be somewhat sweeter than large turnips, though, so most prefer to harvest turnips when the roots are between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 and 7.5 cm) in diameter).\nYou can check the root size by lightly brushing away soil on top of one plant to reveal the root below. If that one plant appears ready for harvest, most of the others will likely be ready, as well.\nMake sure that all of your turnips are harvested before the first frost. Do not allow them to grow too large, since overripe turnips have a woody taste and texture.",
                "Store in cool temperatures. When packed and stored in a cool place, harvested turnips will usually last for three to four months. Consider keeping them in a basement, root cellar, or shed and covering them with straw.\n\n\nTwist off the tops, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of stem before storing the turnips. Do not rinse off any soil since it can actually help protect the roots wile they remain in storage.\nYou might be able to leave your fall crop in the ground until early winter by covering them with a thick mulch, but pull them out before the soil freezes and hardens.\nTurnips can also be stored in the refrigerator."

        "How to Have Perfect and Gorgeous Skin in Less Than 15 Minutes": {
            "intro": "Skin is the largest organ in your body, and has many important functions. Not only is it important to keep it healthy, but you also want to keep it looking great! The best way to get gorgeous skin is to spend time maintaining it and nurturing it. But sometimes you need a quick fix to remedy a particular problem. Maybe you have a big date or an important meeting. Clearly, you want to look your best, but your skin does not always cooperate. Common issues are pimples, redness, and dry, flaky skin. Luckily, there are several ways you can improve the look (and feel) of your skin in just minutes.",
            "steps": [
                "Use a primer. Using a primer is one of the most important steps in creating great looking skin. It is also one that is commonly skipped. Primer is a product that goes on first when applying your make-up. Think of it as the best foundation for your foundation! Primers create a palette that is bright and smooth, which will make the rest of your make-up look flawless. Ask your dermatologist to recommend a primer that is right for you. When used correctly, this product can have a great impact on skin issues such as discoloration and increasing the overall health of your face.[1]",
                "Apply foundation. The young and fresh look is definitely a trend in fashion right now. But looking natural does not mean that you shouldn't take care to make your skin look smooth and even. Foundation is necessary to create a clear, even-looking skin tone. Make sure to choose your color carefully. The idea is to make your skin look pretty, not painted on. Blend carefully to make sure that there are no lines at the edges of your face--check your jawline especially for noticeable problems.[2]\n\nThere are many different types of foundation, so don't be afraid to try a few before finding your perfect match. Some common types are liquids, sticks, and powders.\nUse tools. Proper application can really make all of the difference when using foundation. Try using a make-up sponge or a cosmetics brush to blend.",
                "Focus on the eyes. The skin around your eyes can be one of the biggest trouble areas. Dark circles can tell the world that you are stressed, while puffiness can indicate that you didn't sleep well. Those are personal problems, and you don't need your skin to telegraph that information. That is why it is important to give your eyes plenty of attention when trying to make your skin look great in a flash.Try using a sheer concealer to cover dark circles. This goes on before your foundation, and is only used for spot treatments. To battle puffiness, try using an eye cream--many have immediate results![3]",
                "Get in a routine. You should get in the habit of following a nightly skin care routine. The 10 minutes you spend on your skin each evening can immediately help you achieve the gorgeous skin you want. Typically, your skin care routine will involve 5 steps: cleansing, toner, serum, repair cream, and moisturizer. Make sure that you use products that are right for your skin.[4]\n\nIf your skin is sensitive, meaning that you are prone to breakouts or redness, look for skin-care products that have the words \"gentle\" or \"calming\" in the name or product description. If you suffer from extreme dryness, try something with the words \"extra\" or \"super\" next to \"moisturizing\" or \"hydrating\".\nWhen searching for the skin-care regimen that is right for you, do your research. Don't be afraid to search out a consultant at one of the department store cosmetics counters. They will be be happy to explain products like toners and serums. Plus, they'll likely give you some free samples!",
                "Read the ingredients. Make sure that you know what goes into your skin care products and make-up. There are definitely some ingredients that you want to avoid, so be certain to read labels. Just like you would not knowingly eat something that could harm you, you also do not want to put something on your face that could have dangerous side effects.\n\n\nSome ingredients to avoid are: BHA (can increase sensitivity to sun) and triclosan (which can affect hormone regulation). Consider finding products that tout natural ingredients.[5]",
                "Moisturize. Your skin takes a beating every day. Moisturizing is the most important thing you can do to repair the damage caused by things such as weather and pollutants. If dry skin is your problem, you probably aren't moisturizing enough. Or you could be using the wrong product. Make sure to apply moisturizer in the morning and at night, and anytime you wash your face. Rub the cream into your skin, gently but firmly. Take care to use less pressure on the sensitive skin around your eyes.[6]\n\nFor extra hydration, try applying a special mask once a week. Hydrating masks come in many forms (think gels and creams) and are very effective. Try using a hydrating mask before a big night out. You'll definitely see fast results!",
                "Relax and rest. It's best to make sure that you are getting enough sleep (6-8 hours) each night. But sometimes you don't have an entire night to try to improve your skin. Still, resting can have immediate almost immediate effects. Try a quick cat nap. Odds are, if you feel refreshed, you'll look more refreshed.[7][8]",
                "Raid your refrigerator. You don't have to purchase pricey skin-care products--just head to your kitchen! It is likely that you have several items in your refrigerator or pantry that can help you achieve gorgeous skin quickly. Try different ingredients and different combinations to see what works best. Some common foods that have major benefits for skin include fruits, vegetables, and oils.[9]\n\nTry a sugar scrub. Sugar is an excellent natural exfoliant, and can make your skin appear immediately brighter.Use both brown and white sugars mixed with water for best results.\nGrab a potato. Spuds can have amazing--and fast--benefits for your skin. Rub your face with the juice of a raw potato to help combat pigmentation issues.\nMake a mask. Try making a paste out of natural ingredients to leave on your skin for 10-15 minutes. Some great choices are honey and oatmeal. Homemade masks can make your skin glow!",
                "Search your medicine cabinet. If a pimple is your problem, you can use a simple home remedy to decrease redness and puffiness in the area. Grab an aspirin and dissolve it in water. Put the resulting paste on your spot for a few minutes. After you rinse, you'll see that the redness has decreased. [10]\n\nTry an essential oil. These common oils are great to keep in your bathroom for quick skin fixes. Rub a little sandalwood oil on your face to help reduce redness and irritation.[11]",
                "Leave it alone. A breakout before a big event can definitely put a damper on your plans. If you have some angry-looking pimples, sometimes your best remedy is to do nothing. Avoid picking at spots before leaving the house. Sometimes touching (or popping, or squeezing) can irritate your skin so much that the area will look worse.[12]",
                "Steam it up. Try giving yourself an at home facial. Simply boil some water and then put it in a bowl. Lean your face over the bowl for a few minutes (2-3). The steam can remove dirt and open up your pores. Your skin will look fresh, clean, and glowing! If you have access to a sauna (maybe at your gym, or if you are on vacation) you can use that to achieve the same effects. Just make sure not to stay in too long![13]",
                "Use caution in the sun. We all love to have fun in the sun, but it is important to be careful. Sun damage is responsible for many of the most common skin problems: wrinkles, dryness, and discoloration. Of course, the greatest damage is from skin cancer, which is increasingly common. Make sure to take proper precautions.[14]\n\nMake SPF your friend. It's not enough to apply sunscreen before heading for a day at the beach. It should be part of your every day routine. Look for moisturizers that contain at least 15 SPF. It won't hurt to use make-up that contains SPF, for added protection!\nDress appropriately. Wear light loose clothing to protect your skin. Also, wearing sunglasses is about more than fashion--they are very important in protecting your eyes from the sun!",
                "Take the pressure off. Literally ease up on your skin. A lot of damage to the facial skin is caused by physical pressure. This is the result of simple things such as holding your cell phone to tightly to your face and leaning your chin on your hand while thinking. The pressure can expose your skin to a lot of bacteria, which can result in breakouts and infections. So make sure to touch your face to other objects as little as possible.[15]",
                "Calm down. Next to sun, stress might have the biggest negative impact on your skin. If you are feeling a lot of anxiety, the effects can wreak havoc on your face. There are many ways that stress can manifest itself on your skin, including rashes and increased breakouts. Find a method or tricks to help you relaxed when you are feeling a lot of stress. Your skin will thank you![16]",
                "Keep it clean. The surfaces that come into contact with your skin can be responsible for causing blemishes and irritation. Pay careful attention to your laundry schedule--it is important to rest your face on clean pillow cases. Also, make sure that your make-up brushes are clean. Wash them regularly with warm water and a mild soap.[17]",
                "Watch your diet. Food has a significant impact on your skin. Fruits and vegetables are full of healthy antioxidants that make your skin look firmer and younger, so make them a staple. You'll also want to make sure to get plenty of healthy fats, which will give your skin a hydrated and fresh glow. Try salmon, avocado, and olive oil to get the nutrients your skin needs.[18]\n\nDon't be afraid to have a glass of red wine! It contains properties that can help combat sun damage. Just be aware that drinking too much alcohol can cause dehydration.[19]\n\nThere are also many foods that you want to avoid in order to clear up your skin. If you are prone to breakouts, avoid foods with excess amounts of salt, fat, and sugar. You'll see a positive impact not just in your skin, but in your overall physical health.",
                "Put in some effort. There are many quick fixes for skin problems. Just make sure not to rely on these too heavily. If you develop a skin care routine and stick to it, you'll love the impact. Take care of your skin and soon those flare-ups and breakouts will become much less frequent![20]"

            "intro": "Avocado oil is made by extracting the oil from ripe avocados, and has a number of uses, ranging from cooking and frying to use in hair and skin treatments. Because store-bought avocado oil is often quite expensive, it’s often more economical to prepare the oil at home. Extracting the oil is quite easy, and depending on the method of extraction, you may be left with mashed avocado, perfect for use in baking or in making fresh guacamole!",
            "steps": [
                "Peel twelve avocados. Wash twelve avocados and cut each one in half around the pit. Use the knife to cut in a scooping motion around the pit until the two halves come apart. Use a spoon to scoop out the fruit of the avocado and deposit it in a food processor or blender. Dispose of the skin and the pit.[1]",
                "Puree the avocados. Turn the food processor or blender onto the puree setting. Mix the avocado fruit until it forms a smooth paste. Then scoop out the blended avocado and put it in a medium-sized pot.[2]",
                "Cook the avocados on medium heat. Turn the oven on to medium heat and heat the avocados in the pot, stirring every five minutes. When the mixture starts to boil, it will start bubbling and you should notice the avocado oil rising to the top.[3]",
                "Cook until the mixture gets dark. Keep cooking and stirring the mixture until the avocado changes from a light green to a dark green or brown, and the water has evaporated.[4]",
                "Scoop the avocado mixture into a bowl. When the avocado mixture has stopped cooking, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Place a clean, thin cloth such as cheesecloth on top of the bowl, then holding the cloth in place around the rim of the bowl, turn the bowl upside-down and pinch the corners of the cloth together so that you’re left with a sack of avocado.[5]",
                "Squeeze to strain the avocado. Squeeze the sack of avocado over a bowl to strain out the oil. The oil should come out drop by drop into the bowl. Keep changing your grip and squeezing for a minute or so until no more oil is coming out.[6]",
                "Pour the oil into a container. Once you have squeezed out all the oil, pour the oil from the bowl into a small bottle or into a container with a lid. Your avocado oil is now ready for use!",
                "Remove the fruit from the skins of twelve avocados. Slice the avocados in half around the pit, then do a scooping motion with the knife to separate the two halves of the avocados. Use a spoon to scoop out the fruit of the avocados and set it aside. Dispose of the pit.[7]\n\nYou can use the fruit of the avocados in guacamole or other recipes!",
                "Place the avocado skins in an orange press. Take the avocado skins that you just separated and stack them on top of each other. Then place the stack of avocado skins in an orange press.[8]\n\nAn orange press is designed to juice oranges and other citrus fruits, but it also does a good job of pressing the oil out of avocado skins.",
                "Press the avocado skins. Pull down the lever of the orange press until the mallet of the press touches the avocado skins. Then pull down on the lever with as much force as you can. The mallet will press the avocado skins together and squeeze out the oil.[9]\n\nThe avocado oil should fall into the reservoir under the press.\nConsult the instructions on your orange press if you aren’t sure how it works.",
                "Press until the oil stops dripping. Press the avocado skins several times to extract all the oil. If not all the surface of the skins is being pressed, reposition the skins so that you can press the un-pressed areas.[10]",
                "Strain the oil. Take the reservoir out from the bottom of the press. You may see bits of avocado fruit or skin floating in the oil. If you see anything aside from the oil in the reservoir, strain the oil by placing a coffee filter inside a fine strainer, then resting the strainer inside a bowl pouring the oil through the strainer into the bowl.[11]\n\nThe coffee filter will catch any chunks of avocado that may have gotten into the reservoir.",
                "Let the oil filter, then bottle it. Keep the strainer over the bowl overnight. This allows the oil that may be sticking to the avocado pieces to slowly filter into the bowl. After it has finished filtering, pour the avocado oil into a small bottle and seal it.[12]",
                "Take out the fruit of twelve avocados. Slice the avocados in half around the pit, then use the knife to scoop around the pit and separate the avocado halves. Spoon out the fruit of the twelve avocados and place it in a food processor.[13]",
                "Puree the avocado in a food processor. Once you have scooped out the fruit of the twelve avocados into the food processor, puree the avocados until you are left with a thick paste.[14]\n\nYou can also hand mash the avocados if you don’t have a food processor.",
                "Spread the avocado on a baking tray. Spoon out the mashed avocado onto a baking tray, then use a spatula to spread the avocado out into as thin a layer as you can. Try to make the layer about half an inch (1.3 centimeters) thick.",
                "Put the tray of avocado into the oven. After you have spread the avocado out into a thin layer, place the tray into the oven. You don’t need to preheat it, but be sure not to set the temperature to more than 155 degrees F (50 degrees C). You are trying to dry the avocado out, not bake it.[15]\n\nYou can also put the tray of avocado outside to dry in the sun for about two days.",
                "Keep the avocado in the oven for five hours. Let the avocado dry out in the oven for around five hours. Check every hour or so to make sure the avocado isn’t burning. It should be a dark-brownish green; if is turning black, take it out of the oven.[16]",
                "Remove the avocado from the tray. After five hours are up, take the baking pan out of the oven. Use a spatula to work against the avocado layer and scratch it off of the pan. Place the avocado scraps into a thin cotton cloth or a square of gauze.[17]",
                "Squeeze the sack of avocado into a bowl. Lift up the cloth with the avocado and pinch the corners together so you make a sack of sorts. With as much force as you can, squeeze the dried avocado into a bowl. Readjust your grip as you are squeezing to make sure that you have squeezed all of the avocado. Stop when the avocado stops yielding oil.[18]",
                "Pour the avocado oil into a bottle. When you have squeezed all of the avocado oil into the bowl, dispose of the cloth and the dried avocado. Then pour the avocado oil into a bottle and seal it.[19]"

        "How to Save a Marriage": {
            "intro": "Sometimes, letting go seems like the easiest thing to do. But think about this: you've invested so much of your time and energy into another person (and possibly little ones); you've made a solemn promise; and you still know there's love, even if it's hiding underneath the surface. This article will show you how to save a marriage and avoid divorce, even if you're the only one trying. If you want to resurrect the happy times in your marriage and put the rough ones on the back burner, read on for a discussion of how to do just that.",
            "steps": [
                "Make an effort to figure out what went wrong. You can't move forward if you don't know what's keeping you back. Most relationships — and people — suffer from a few flaws, and perhaps those flaws are getting in the way of a healthy relationship. Your job is to take a long, hard look at what you think went wrong. Here are just a few:\n\n\n\nGrowing incompatibility. Work, family, stress, finance and everything else our modern world throws at you can cause people to reveal their true colors. Are the real-world husband and wife very different from the fairy-tale version?\n\nInfidelity. Is the guilt of an affair weighing on you or your spouse? Did confession cause everything to suddenly blow up?\n\nLack of communication. What you say doesn't get processed by your spouse, and what your spouse says doesn't get processed by you. Maybe neither of you says anything at all.\n\nDeath of a loved one. You or your spouse's world changed irrevocably after someone close to you died, and you can't go back to the life you had before.\n\nMoney. Someone is a spendthrift and the other is a penny-pincher, and the twain never meet. Or maybe growing financial insecurity is making home life bitingly negative.\n\nSex. If sex is a physical symbol of your love for one another, the wilting of that symbol can be both emotionally and physically saddening.",
                "Figure out if what went wrong is something fixable. It's a perfectly natural response to try to save your sinking ship, but what if the ship is so tattered that it isn't worth saving? No one can make this decision for you, but know that certain flaws in people or relationships might not be worth trying to save.\n\n\nKnow that people rarely change. People often say they'll change, but they rarely do. After they're comfortable, they usually revert back to the people they were before. It's not impossible for someone to change wholesale, but it's unlikely.",
                "Open communication with your spouse. Get information from them about how they think the relationship can be improved. When bringing up this difficult conversation with your spouse, remember a few things:\n\n\nDon't be accusatory. Accusing them of something will only burn bridges. Instead of \"I thought you were going to take care of that, which is why I'm angry it didn't happen,\" you can say \"We all know that no one's perfect. I just thought you were going to take care of that, so I was surprised when it didn't happen.\"\n\nCount to three before you answer. A lot of the time, our impulse is to fight back instead of hear what the person is actually saying. Count to three before you answer, thinking about what your spouse has said. Calm and composure on your end will produce similar results on their end.",
                "Seek out a marriage counselor (optional). A marriage counselor, while expensive, offers highly nuanced insight into the clockwork of your marriage. A counselor might be able to identify what went wrong from an informed, but emotionally distant, place. Because the counselor has no skin in the game, so to speak, s/he is less likely to lie, to cut corners, or forget inconvenient facts. A marriage counselor might very well save your marriage.",
                "Test the waters for change. Is your spouse absolutely unwilling to bend? If so, it might be hard to create the change you want to see in your relationship. If you're unsure, test the waters to see if your spouse seems willing to make the necessary changes to save the relationship. Again, it's hard to help somebody who doesn't want to be helped. You can test the waters by:\n\n\nAsking your spouse if they're willing to see a marriage counselor\nAsking your spouse if they love you as much, if not more, than they did on your wedding day.\nAsking your spouse if they're willing to sacrifice — along with you — in order to make the relationship work.",
                "Create a safe space for this communication. A lot of the time, a marriage begins to fall apart because both parties forget to communicate, feel unsafe or embarrassed communicating, or think they're communicating when they're actually not. In order to encourage the right sort of communication, think about:\n\n\nSetting aside a time of the day for you and your spouse to come together and just talk. No sex, no children, no TV, no work. Just talk. If you want to talk about your issues, talk about that. If you want to talk about your day, talk about that. Setting aside time to talk will grease the wheels and encourage deeper communication.\nLet your spouse vent. Sometimes, your spouse just wants to get something off their chest: they don't want an analysis, they don't want direction, they just want a pair of ears and a shoulder to lean on.",
                "Don't use threats as a bargaining chip. Often, threats are bandied about a failing marriage like horseshoes on the 4th of July. Threats don't mean you're a bad person, they just mean that you've learned a bad habit, one you should unlearn. The problem with threats is that they encourage people to do the right things for the wrong reasons: your spouse shouldn't want to save the marriage because you're threatening to leave them — your spouse should want to save the marriage because they absolutely, deeply love you.",
                "Learn how to argue effectively, with humility. Arguments in marriage are bound to happen. The couples that survive and build on their love are able to overcome personal hangups, put themselves in their partner's shoes, and learn from their mistakes. If you want to save your marriage, both you and your spouse are going to have to learn how to argue the right way.\n\n\nDon't dig up the past. It's really tempting to bring up what happened 14 years ago as a piece of evidence about why your spouse is undeserving or wrong. This misses the point: the point isn't to \"win\" the argument, it's to get your spouse to hear your point and possibly change their behavior. If you constantly dredge up old dirt on your spouse, they'll feel attacked instead of involved in a discussion. That's when the argument starts to go astray.\nDon't use ad-hominem attacks. An ad-hominem attack is when you attack a person (their physical, emotional, psychological traits) instead of their ideas. Sometimes, a trait needs to be criticized and dealt with. But too often, it feels like a serious low-blow and causes more mudslinging than than coming together.",
                "Say what you do and do what you say (and expect the same from your spouse). A relationship is all about trust. Trust is gained when expectations are met, and when actions are followed through on. If you say you're going to do something, do it. A failure to follow through on your words causes your spouse to believe that your words aren't what you say they are. This leads to a breakdown in trust.",
                "Learn how to celebrate the successes and commiserate the failures. Every life is filled with ups and downs, just as every person is filled with strengths and weaknesses. In a failing marriage, we too often use our partner's failures as a chance to secretly gloat and pass over our partner's success like we take them for granted. What more does a husband or wife want than to have their loved one be with them in times of despair and share happiness with them in times of joy?\n\n\nIf the idea of celebrating your spouse's successes and ruing your spouse's failures sounds horribly weird, take a step back and think about what you want to get out of your marriage. Most happily married couples admit feeling joy for their spouse when they're happy and feeling sadness for them when they're not.",
                "Leave time for some time apart. Falling back into love all over again is great, but sometimes that personal independence that we all yearn for gets lost along the way. Often, what we need is an hour or two of alone-time to engage ourselves in something that we absolutely love, whether it's gardening, fixing cars, or reading books. If one person in the marriage feels smothered, they're going to take that displease out on their spouse, and it's unlikely to lead to happiness. During your time of reconciliation, set aside time to do things you both love, to recharge, and most important, to reflect.",
                "Admit to your spouse that neither one of you is responsible for this lull in your marriage. It's tempting to blame everything wrong that's happened on your spouse without admitting that you were somehow also complicit. There's also space for admitting that you both shoulder blame and responsibility. The process of saying that to your spouse can mean a lot, helping you to reform your bond.\n\n\nFor example, it's unfair to say that your spouse never made dinner with the family a priority if you didn't try to work with them to fix that. You can say something like: \"You didn't make dinner as much of a priority as I would have liked, but I was guilty of holding that against you and not trying to work with your busy schedule to accommodate you when you were free.\"",
                "Rededicate your commitment by making it tangible. A marriage is also about commitment, a commitment that puts other people ahead of oneself. If you feel like rededicating your commitment to your marriage, consider making it physical or tangible to that your spouse can see that commitment. Gift your spouse a:\n\n\nRing\nPicture\nFlower or plant (something growing)\nMeal\nWork of art (made by you)",
                "Switch up the environment. Couples whose marriages are in danger often take trips, both faraway and close, because the monotony of life back home has them taking each other for granted. When the obligations of work, kids, and family go away, couples rediscover why they fell in love in the first place.\n\n\n\nNote: a vacation can be a pretty poor litmus test of whether the relationship is going to succeed. A vacation is all play and no work. Going back to the familiar routine of work, family upkeep, and chores can cause the fairy tale ending to end very quickly.",
                "Try to go on a date. A loving marriage is one in which both partners still enjoy the thought of being with one another all alone. Some couples try to engineer a date night every week, others every couple of weeks. At the very least, try to plan a date night with just you and your spouse once a month. This should help reignite your passion for one another, as well as eliminating some of the more tedious responsibilities of everyday life."

            "intro": "If your car is having difficulty starting, or you find that it starts fine sometimes but intermittently won’t turn over, you may have an issue with your battery cables. Battery cables carry electrical current from your car’s battery to the starter and then into the car’s electrical system. This allows your car to run electrical devices like your radio with the car off, and provides your car’s starter with the energy it needs to get your engine to turn over. Compromised battery cables can reduce the current traveling into the starter or may not allow electricity to pass through them at all, making it so your car won’t start or won’t continue running once it has. Replacing your car’s battery cables is an inexpensive first step to troubleshooting an electrical issue with your car, and may even solve your problems.",

                "Ensure the car is turned off. It’s important that you make sure the car is in park and turned off before beginning the process of replacing your battery cables. You will be working with the car’s electrical system, so leaving it running could increase the likelihood of you receiving an electrical shock and could possibly do damage to the vehicle.[2]\n\nRemove the keys from the ignition to make sure no one can accidentally try to start it while you’re working under the hood.\nIf your car is a standard, make sure the parking break is engaged instead of having the car in park.",
                "Locate the battery. Different automakers place the batteries in their cars in different locations for a number of reasons. Most car batteries can be located near the front or nose of the car on the left or right. It looks like a large, usually black box with two metal terminals sticking out of the top, each with cables attached. Make sure the hood struts can support the weight of the hood before you release it, otherwise it could fall and hurt you. If you cannot locate the battery under the hood of the car, it may be in the trunk.[3]\n\nSome automakers place the battery in the trunk to improve weight distribution or save space.\nIf you cannot locate your battery, refer to your owner’s manual. It will show you how to locate and access your battery.",
                "Determine which is the positive and which is the negative terminal. Once you have located the battery, you will need to differentiate between the positive and negative terminals. Car battery cables are usually colored to match their use: red cables are positive, black cables are negative. In some cases, the wires may both be black, but they will have red and black boxes or accents at the ends of the cable.[4]\n\nIf there are no discernible colors visible, you can easily determine which is the negative cable by following them from the battery to the other end. Negative cables bolt directly to the body of the car or engine block, positive cables attach to the starter.\nThe battery will have labels marked with a + and a – sign. The plus is the positive cable terminal, the – is the negative.",
                "Remove boxes or tape covering the end of the cable. You will often find other wires attached to a battery cable using electric tape (particularly on the positive side). Sometimes these wires are held in place more securely using metal or plastic retainers. Do not remove these wires, but cut off any tape that prevents you from reaching the bolt that keeps the cable secured to the terminal.[5]\n\nIf the end of the cable is housed in a plastic box indicating if it is positive or negative, you can open the box by squeezing the two clips on either side of it.\nBe careful not to cut any wires when trying to access the bolts.",
                "Disconnect the negative cable. The negative cable, also called the ground cable, should be the first you disconnect. Once you disconnect this cable, the car will no longer have a completed electrical circuit, and you may notice any dashboard, interior or engine bay lights that were on will instantly shut off. This indicates that the battery is no longer connected to the car in a manner that can power it.[6]\n\nYou will need to loosen the bolt that holds the cable in place, but you will not need to remove it.\nIf the bolt is seized or will not turn, try spraying some WD-40 on it. It will eat away some of the rust and oxidization and allow the bolt to turn more freely.\nDo not allow the negative cable to come into contact with the positive terminal at any time.",
                "Disconnect the positive cable. Because the negative cable is the one most often disconnected while working under the hood of a car, the positive one may by slightly more difficult to remove. Once the positive cable is disconnected from the battery, the battery will be completely disconnected and may be removed.[7]\n\nSet the end of the cable aside so that it can’t fall back into place and make contact with either battery terminal.\nIf your battery is in the trunk, the positive cable will attach to another connector near the body of the car. Simply disconnect it from there.",
                "Remove the battery. Some cars will not require the removal of the battery while replacing battery cables, but even if it is not necessary, it may make the process easier. Removing the battery can free up room to work and removes any possibility of the cables coming back into contact with their terminals and shocking you.[8]\n\nMany cars have a bracket that holds the battery in place. Removing this bracket usually requires unscrewing two bolts.\nMake sure to set the battery upright after removing it from the car.",
                "Remove the negative cable, then the positive. Start by following the negative cable from the now loose end back to where it is bolted to the engine block or body of the car. Take note of how it is routed so you can follow the same path with the new cable. Once you locate the other end, use a wrench to remove the bolt that holds the negative cable in place. Then repeat the process for the positive cable, which will be attached to the starter on the other end.[9]\n\nBe sure the car is not hot while doing this or you may burn yourself.\nIt’s important you remember the way the cables are routed through the engine bay to ensure they don’t interfere with any moving parts when you replace them.",
                "Compare the new and old cables. With both the positive and negative cables removed, compare them to your replacement cables. If you purchased cables specific to your car, they should match in length and have the same terminal connectors at each end. If they don’t you will need to return them for the proper cables. If you are using universal cables that you cut to length, use the old cables as your guide.[10]\n\nIf the new cables are slightly longer than the old, that likely won’t be an issue, but shorter cables will not work.\nMake sure the connecting ends at either side of the new cables match the old ones for easy installation.",
                "Prepare the new cables for installation. If there were plastic protective boxes on the old cable’s ends, remove them from the old cables and place them on the new ones. You will also need to ensure that there is no paint or dirt stuck on the new cable ends before you install them.[11]\n\nThe connections on either end of the cable should be bare metal to allow electricity to pass through them.\nYou can use a steel toothed brush to clean off the connector ends of the cables in order to ensure a good electrical connection.",
                "Attach the positive cable to the starter. Use the same bolt you removed to disconnect the old cable to attach the new one in its place. If the bolt is rusted, you may want to use a steel wire brush to remove the rust from the bolt and ensure a proper connection. If it is too rusted, you may need to replace it.[12]\n\nMake sure the bolt is good and tight so it can’t vibrate loose as the car runs.\nRun the new positive cable back through the engine bay in the same way the old one was.",
                "Attach the negative cable to the body or block. Locate the hole the old negative cable was attached to and use the same bolt to connect the new cable. Once again, ensure the bolt is in good enough condition to hold the cable in place and allow electricity to pass through the cable.[13]\n\nRun the new negative cable back through the engine bay in the same route the old one took.\nUse a flashlight to ensure neither cable is coming into contact with any belts. Belts spin at high speeds under the engine bay and can damage battery cables.",
                "Place the battery back in the car. With both new cables in place, it’s time to place the battery back into the car. Make sure not to let the new cables come into contact with the battery terminals as you return it, as that could result in you receiving a shock. If the terminals on the battery appear to be oxidized or rusted, use a steel tooth brush to clean off the connection area before you place the battery back into the car.[14]\n\nBolt the bracket that holds the battery back into place to secure the battery.\nBe sure you placed the battery back in the same way it was before you took it out, so the positive terminal is closer to the positive cable, and the negative terminal is closer to the negative cable.",
                "Connect the positive battery cable to the battery. You may want to purchase a corrosion inhibitor that you can put on the battery terminal prior to connecting the new cable. This can help ensure the connection from the battery is strong and doesn’t become limited as corrosion builds up in your engine bay. Squeeze the inhibitor onto the terminal, then slide the new positive cable connection over it.[15]\n\nTighten the cable by turning the bolt you loosened to remove the old one.\nMake sure the cable is connected firmly. It if jostles loose while you are driving the car will turn off.",
                "Connect the negative cable. Remember that connecting the negative battery cable will complete the car’s circuit and reestablish power to the vehicle. Be sure all other connections are tight before completing this step. You may also want to use the corrosion inhibitor on the negative terminal. Once the negative cable is connected, the car can be started again.[16]\n\nBe careful when touching the negative cable to the terminal and it may produce some sparks.\nTighten the cable down securely so you can be sure it won’t jiggle loose.",
                "Start the car. Make sure you attached the cable properly by starting the car. If the car fails to turn over, one of the cables may not be properly fastened and the electricity is not reaching the starter. If the car attempts to turn over but can’t quite start, your battery may not have enough charge. If the car fails to start, recheck where the cables are connected on both ends.[17]\n\nIf the cables are installed properly and secured, remove the battery again and take it to your local auto parts store. They can test and charge the battery to ensure it’s still good.\nIf the cables were loose at all, tighten them and try again.\nIf the car starts fine, you’re all done!"

        "How to Become a Lender": {
            "intro": "Some consumers or individuals with spare capital tend to follow the old axiom \"neither a borrower nor a lender be,\" but others are looking at how to cash in on lending. Seeing how much income banks and major lenders make from their loans is enough to get some individual cash or asset holders interested in lending out some of their money, hoping to make good gains in interest payments over time. A combination of economic incentives and new technology allows more people to effectively become a lender and get some good returns on money that they currently have parked in low interest bank accounts.",
            "steps": [
                "Collect your capital. For the best results, you'll want all of your lendable money to be collected in one central account or \"pot.\" This will also help you to figure out how much you can lend without negatively impacting your own household budget.\n\n\nIt's best to plan for a worst-case scenario where you only lend money that you can live without, in case a loan does not get repaid.",
                "Understand your loan goals. Before you get into actually lending out money, you'll want to look at several factors including how long you want that money to be tied up, and how much you plan to make with it. This will help you narrow down lending choices further on in the process.",
                "Look at the tax burden. The plain fact that experienced money handlers understand is that every investment has a tax burden, and lending is no exception. As a personal taxpayer, you will have to pay taxes on income from interest payments, which will be taken out of your gross gains, or yield. It's incumbent on you as the lender to figure out how this will affect your future tax bills.",
                "Research micro lending. For almost all individual would-be lenders, the best way to effective lending is through Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) that help small lenders find interested borrowers. Take a look at these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.[1]\n\nPopular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.\nSome of the reasons people are looking to borrow through micro loans include:[2]\nPay off credit cards at a lower interest rate\nStart a small business or expand an existing one\nFinance a creative project such as a film, music or artwork\nFinance a wedding, car repair or consolidate other loans",
                "Evaluate how micro lending sites rate borrowers. In a similar method as the ones used by big lenders, micro-lending sites often \"rate\" borrowers according to answers they give on a questionnaire. This way lenders can match borrowers that meet their desired level of risk. Generally, you'll be picking a \"basket\" of loans and betting that the majority of them will not default, or in other words, be unable to repay.\n\n\nRiskier borrowers will be charged a higher interest rate.",
                "Make the deal. When you have your desired loan recipients picked out, you should be able to seal the deal on micro lending sites using their proprietary tools and paperwork. When these are all finished, you will actually be a lender, able to collect income payments to boost your total investment portfolio.",
                "Consider a lending club. Rather than loaning money to a single borrower, in a lending club you invest in notes, or $25 portions. This way your investment is spread across hundreds of loans, while the borrowers' loans are funded by many different investors.[3]",
                "Evaluate the benefits of micro lending. The main benefit of micro lending is returns on your investments ranging from 5-9%. This is much higher than you would get on a savings or money market account. These returns take into consideration a 4-5% default rate and 1% in fees from the micro lending company.\n\n[4]\nMicro loans are not tied into the stock market, so even if the market plunges you should still get a good return on your investment.[5]",
                "Evaluate the risks of micro lending. Borrowers may default on the loans. This type of loan is not secured by a house or other collateral that a bank would normally require. Borrowers can also file for bankruptcy and you would lose your investment.[6]",
                "Consider an automated investing tool. Rather than choosing individual borrowers that can become very time consuming, you can arrange for automated investing. You select a mix of loan grades according to borrower risk and set the amount for each loan. Then the tool will automatically invest in loans for you and send a daily report online.[7]"

        "How to Get Rid of Heel Spurs": {
            "intro": "Heel spurs are tiny protruding calcium deposits that can develop near the base of your heel bone. They can be caused by repetitive activities, such as dancing or running, or they can form in association with plantar fasciitis, which is an inflammation of the ligament (plantar fascia) on the bottom of your foot. When the plantar fascia is tight and pulls on your heel bone, the bone releases calcium to try to heal itself. The excess deposits of calcium can sometimes form heel spurs.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Go to your hardware shop. Purchase a 150mm length of dowel by 20mm in diameter, or perhaps find a ready-made a rod in the same dimension.",
                "Stand supported against a bench with the painful area pressed heavily down on the rod. Roll it backward and forward on the area. The pain is severe at first but it becomes less as you continue.",
                "Repeat this several times a day or if you are at a desk, slip off your shoes and continue throughout the day. You will experience no pain after several days or so but the soreness is the bruise which occurred.",
                "Continue until the heel is no longer painful to walk on.\n\n\nYou may have to repeat the procedure some point in time should it become uncomfortable.",
                "Ask your doctor about injections to relieve heel pain. Your doctor may inject a corticosteroid along with a local anesthetic like Xylocaine. Some doctors may inject Botox into your foot to relax the plantar fascia.",
                "Try Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT). ESWT uses sound waves to slightly injure the tissues surrounding the heel, which could cause the parts that are causing pain to heal.",
                "Have surgery if no other treatments work. Before performing surgery, doctors usually give home treatments and improved footwear about a year to work. When nothing else eases the pain, here's what you need to know about surgical options:\n\n\n\nInstep plantar fasciotomy: Doctors remove part of the plantar fascia to ease pressure on the nerves in your foot.\n\nEndoscopy: This surgery performs the same function as an instep plantar fasciotomy but uses smaller incisions so that you'll heal faster. However, endoscopy has a higher rate of nerve damage, so consider this before you opt for this option.[3]\n\nBe prepared to wear a below-the-knee walking cast to ease the pain of surgery and to speed the healing process. These casts, or \"boots,\" usually work better than crutches to speed up your recovery time.[4]",
                "Apply an icepack. Place your icepack on your heel for 10 to 15 minutes at least twice a day. You can also try rolling your foot over an iced can or bottle if your heel spurs are accompanied by plantar fasciitis.",
                "Take over-the-counter medicine to ease the pain. Try acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",
                "Get some rest. You need to stay off of your aching foot as much as possible for at least a week.\n\n\nThink about possible causes of the problem while you're resting and figure out how you can make some changes. Some actions that can contribute to heel spurs include:\n\nRunning too often or running on hard surfaces such as concrete\nTight calf muscles\nShoes with poor shock absorption[5]\n\n\n\nEase back into your activities. In many cases, you'll be in too much pain to go ahead with a strenuous exercise routine that puts pressure or impact on your heel. Listen to your body and switch to different activities such as swimming or riding a bike until your heel spurs improve.",
                "Wear night splints. Splints stretch your plantar fascia while you're sleeping. For example, you can wear a device that consists of an L-shaped fiberglass splint and wrap a bandage around it to keep it in place while you're asleep.[6]",
                "Perform some exercises. Exercises that strengthen and lengthen your plantar fascia can also be very helpful for heel spurs. Try some of the following activities:\n\n\n\nCalf stretch: Place your hands on a wall. Extend 1 foot (0.3 m) behind you with your knee straight and place the other foot in front of you with the knee bent. Push your hips toward the wall and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. You should feel a pull in your calf muscles. Repeat the stretch 20 times for each foot.\n\nPlantar fascia stretch: Perform this exercise in the morning before you've done any standing or walking. Cross your injured foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp your toes and gently pull them toward you. If you can't reach your toes, then wrap a towel around them and pull on the towel. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 20 times for each foot.[7]",
                "Choose new shoes that are the right size. Have your foot measured when you go to the shoe store instead of taking a guess about the size. Also, try on shoes at the end of the day or after a workout, when your feet are at their largest. To ensure a good fit, wear the same type of socks or nylons that you would normally wear with the type of shoe that you are trying on.",
                "Walk around before you buy shoes. Before you purchase your shoes, do the following:\n\n\nRe-lace the shoes if you're trying on athletic shoes. Start at the farthest eyelets and apply even pressure to the laces as you come closer to the tongue of the shoe.\nMake sure that you can wiggle your toes freely inside of the shoe. Also, make sure that you have at enough space between your tallest toe and the end of the shoe. You should have room equal to about the width of your thumb in the tip of your shoe.\nWalk around to make sure that the shoe has a firm grip on your heel without sliding up and down.\nWalk or run a few steps to make sure your shoes are comfortable. Shoes that fit properly require no break-in period.[8]",
                "Use orthotic inserts. You can purchase orthotics over the counter, or you can have orthotics specially fitted by your podiatrist. Try 1 of these options:\n\n\n\nHeel cups: These inserts will help to align the bones in your foot and to cushion your heel. Check your skin for blisters when you first start using heel cups. Also, your feet may sweat more with a heel cup, so change your socks and shoes often.\n\nInsoles: While you can pick up generic insoles at a drugstore, you may have more luck if you go to a store that sells athletic shoes. Push on the arch to make sure that it doesn't collapse. If your insoles help but could use a little work, you can take them to a podiatrist to get them customized.\n\nCustom orthotics: A podiatrist can make a cast of your foot and provide you with custom-made orthotics. These may be more expensive, but they are made of materials specifically designed for your needs, and they can last up to 5 years if your podiatrist refurbishes them every 1 or 2 years. To find a podiatrist near you, look at the Web page for the American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine.[9]\n\n\nDynamic Insoles: Lack of elasticity in plantar fascia in the foot is for most people the real problem. If there is poor elasticity in the lengthwise tendons in the foot (plantar fascia) in relation to a person's general condition, only a small additional strain is required for the pull on the tendons to cause damage to the tissues connecting the tendons to the heel bone. This will generate an inflamed condition called Plantar Fasciitis.\n\nThe pain associated with Plantar Fasciitis is typically noticeable from the heel bone and forward towards the front of the foot. It is, however, also possible for the pain to show in the heel cushion, alongside the foot, on top of the foot and up into the Achilles tendon. The water wave therapy is the only therapy that works actively to solve the heel problem. This is achieved by exercising the tendons in the foot towards the necessary elasticity and at the same time providing pain relief for the heel by employing very special water-based shock absorbing and dynamic pressure relief system."

        "wikiHow to Collect Small Business Debt": {
            "intro": "Small businesses rely on a healthy flow of income to remain in business—especially since over 50% of new businesses fail within the first five years.[1] For small businesses, a bad debt can mean the difference between profitability and net losses. For a small business, collecting debts can be a difficult and, occasionally, litigious process. There are a number of things you can do to increase your chances of being paid. Read on to find out how to avoid bad debts, manage overdue payments and collect debts.",
            "steps": [
                "Develop a payment policy. Before you provide any services or goods, contract with your customer so they understand what they are responsible for paying and when. Make sure all document language is clear. Discuss the account with the customer so you can be sure they are familiar with any charged amounts and due dates. Payment terms need to be agreed on by both parties.\n\n\nConsider adopting a late payment fee to encourage on-time payments. You may choose to charge a percentage of the total bill when payments become delinquent—2% is typical. Make sure all late fee policies are included in your contract or payment policy.\nYou may prefer to ask for at least 50% of payment upfront. This ensures you at least receive something in exchange for your time and efforts.\nDo research about collecting interest. Federal and state laws regulate the collection of interest on debts. Always make sure that any interest you charge is lawful and included in your payment policy to avoid debt forfeiture or a fine. You can check usa.gov for your state's usury laws.\nYou can also check your state's attorney general website for information on legal interest rates and legal practices in your state.",
                "List the due date on every bill you send. Some invoices state, \"payment due upon receipt.\" You may also use \"net 15 days,\" \"net 30 days\" or any other period of time in which you expect someone to remit payment.\n\n\nPlacing a due date on a bill encourages your customer to include it in a current or upcoming billing cycle. If you do not place a due date on the bill, the business or individual may wait a month or two before paying, especially if bills are tight.\nDon't wait 30 days from the date of service or delivery of the product to send out a bill. Bill every 15 to 30 days. The sooner you send out the bill, the more likely you will get paid sooner.",
                "Send reminder bills. When a payment becomes past due, immediately send a reminder noting the amount owed as well as the fact that payment is now past due. Many customers are so busy that they simply forget a bill hasn’t been paid. They will often pay it as soon as they realize payment is past due.\n\n\nKeep a record of all contact with the debtor. You will need the dates and times of your calls, letters and any other communication about the late payment, in case of legal action. You may also need to address this information when you contact the debtor.",
                "Keep a contact with each company or customer. Make sure you have relevant contact information, such as address, telephone number and extension number, if available.It is also good to check in with your business contacts regularly. Engaged business relationships promote a mutual desire to fulfill transactions.\n\n\nAddress each bill directly to the person who makes financial decisions in a business or the person responsible for the account.\nIf you don’t have a contact for a business transaction, you can usually call the front desk and be connected to Accounts Payable.",
                "Create a procedure for dealing with debts. You will need to decide what happens when payments are late. Generally, you first send out a reminder, then call the customer or business that is late with a payment, follow up, try to negotiate and then take it to collections or pursue legal action if the debt remains unpaid. Everyone in your company should understand the process so they know where to direct those who owe debts when they reach out to you.",
                "Understand your debtor. Try to figure out why the payment is late. Most debtors fall into 1 of 3 categories—either they want to pay but can’t do it on time because of difficulties with finances, they habitually delay payments as long as possible due to priorities for the month or they have decided not to pay you at all.[2]\n\nWhen you speak to the person or department that owes you money, try to uncover what type of debtor they are. Once you understand if non-payment has to do with finances, priorities or actual avoidance, you can come up with a solution for both parties that is, hopefully, mutually beneficial.\nKeep in mind that negotiating with a debtor is a process. Take time to listen to the customer and offer solutions that you think will be appealing to them. This will increase your chances of achieving a win-win situation.\nKnow that a business with financial trouble may not want to discuss their possible failure. If the business is in financial trouble, then you may consider offering them a settlement amount instead of trying to obtain the full payment.",
                "Call the debtor about the account. The first step after mailing a bill and reminder is to contact them by phone. Identify yourself and your reason for calling.\n\n\nDo not harass the debtor, just be straightforward. Always use a civil tone and try to convey a desire to keep a positive relationship. You can address consequences further down the line.\nAsk the person how they are and if they received your invoice. To discuss the late payment, try: \"I am concerned because your payment is now (insert how many days) late. What can I do to help you make this payment and minimize consequences, such as (insert consequence)?\" You can also ask if there is a reason they want to discuss on why the payment has been late.\nTry to get a verbal agreement that the invoice will be paid and when.\nFollow up the conversation in a week by phone, email or mail.\nNever apologize for asking about a debt that is owed to you. Remember that the money rightfully belongs to you.",
                "Call back in 15 to 30 days. If the debtor has not yet paid the debt, then you will want to remind them that the debt is still outstanding. At this point, the debt is probably around 60 days late. The longer payment is delayed, the less likely you will be paid.\n\n\nYou will want to be polite and ask how the person is doing before talking about the debt. At this point, you need to be clear that consequences are forthcoming. You can say: \"As we agreed when you signed the contract/payment policy, when payment becomes (insert the amount of days) late, (insert consequences).\"\nRemind them all the times you have sent out notices, called, etc. See if they are willing to make a payment toward what they owe before you get off the phone with them.\nInquire about reasons for which payment is delayed. Be understanding. Ask if the debtor desires to pay by payment plan in order to avoid interest.",
                "Discontinue all services or goods that the debtor receives. The amount of time that needs to pass before this happens should be detailed in your payment and company policies. Call them and send them a written letter of warning before discontinuing service for non-payment.",
                "Write demand letters. These letters should address the account and include past invoices and references to past communication. Although they should not be directly threatening, the language should increasingly reference harsher legal action if they ignore their bill. Make sure you include a date that they must take action by to avoid further consequences.\n\n\nFor a small fee, you can work with an attorney or collection agency (without turning the debt over to them) at this step to make your letters more persuasive. Sometimes a customer will decide to pay when they see the collection agency or attorney information on the demand letter.\nSome companies offer services such as writing a series of letters, making telephone collection calls on your behalf, and more.[3][4][5]",
                "Negotiate with the debtor. Negotiation may be your only chance to receive some payment for your services or goods. Ask what they can pay or offer them a discount, depending upon the situation. Pursuing payment after this step can be expensive, so it may be worth it to accept whatever the debtor can pay.\n\n\nIf you know the business or customer is avoiding payment, it may be less expensive to give a discount and never deal with them again than to hire a collections agency or lawyer.",
                "Send a \"pre-collect notice\" to the debtor. The letter is usually sent by a collection agency letting your debtor know you are seriously considering turning the debt over. This should state what options that the debtor has at this point and the date by which they have to respond. Sometimes debtors may respond when they realize this may be their last chance to deal with you before the debt affects their credit.",
                "Be aware of bankruptcy. If you suspect your debtor may go bankrupt, then you will need legal advice from an attorney. You will also need to file a proof of claim to help your case. Once the debtor files bankruptcy, you can no longer take action to collect the debt unless the court decides otherwise.\n\n\nSigns that someone who owes you money may be considering bankruptcy include: delayed payment, no communication with you and adverse economic conditions.",
                "Choose how to collect the debt. To collect a debt, you can give the debt to a collection agency, go to small claims court or go to civil court if the amount is more substantial. A collection agency specializes in collecting debts and usually works for a percentage of the debt payments they receive—usually 50%. Small claims court does not require attorney fees and may be a good option with smaller debts. Civil court is really only feasible when amounts owed exceed $40,000.[6]",
                "Select a debt collection service. If you decide to move forward by giving the debt to a collection agency, then you need to know how to make the best agency choice. Always research your options. Call collection agencies and talk to them about your situation and find out whether they think they can collect the money owed.\n\n\nKnow that some individuals and businesses will not be concerned when you hand the debt over to a collection agency. They don’t care about their credit scores or reputation. In these cases, the legal system may be a better option.\nBe sure that the agency you choose is licensed and bonded for business. Also, make sure they follow state and federal laws for debt collection, such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It can make your business look bad if you do business with an agency that is not compliant.\nThe Consumer Protection Agency in your state or the regional Federal Trade Commission (FTC) office keeps records of grievances filed against an agency. Check with them first before selecting a particular agency.[7] Try checking your state's attorney general website to see if there have been any consumer complaints, investigations, or rulings filed against a specific business in your state.",
                "Turn the debt over. You’ve decided the money you’re owed is large enough to pursue. You have determined that the cost of an agency is lower than just ignoring the debt or writing it off as bad debt when you do your taxes. You’ve picked an agency and have now “sold” the debt to them to manage.\n\n\nBe sure to give copies of all previous correspondence to the agency. Understand that you will not receive the full debt and will likely receive about 50% of what the agency can get from the debtor or whatever percentage you and the agency agree on.",
                "Take the debtor to small claims court. If you are owed a modest sum, such as $5,000 or less, then this is a viable option. Small claims court was developed to avoid excessive legal fees for relatively small, contested amounts. It ensures you can receive some of the funds owed without having to pay high court and attorney fees. However, be aware that even if you are awarded a judgment in small claims court, the defendant can still refuse to comply. You do have some options for enforcing the ruling, but these will take up more of your time and money. Also, keep in mind that after a case has been filed in small claims court it cannot be appealed.\n\n\nYou will need to do paperwork in order to file a small claims action, and you will need to make sure the debtor is served. You will have a court date where your case will be decided, and you will likely have small fees to pay for paperwork.\nTry a mediation. This is often done as part of small claims court. It is useful in the case of a dispute about payment amounts, and it can help you reach a settlement. You will need to split the cost of a professional mediator with your debtor.\nSeek arbitration. An arbitrator is an impartial party that rules on a case. If both sides agree to arbitration, the decision is final.\nReport the debtor to the state's credit bureau. You may choose to bring in an attorney to make sure all paperwork is done right. The aim of this is to place the debt as a bad mark on the debtor's credit record."

        "How to Flip Houses With No Money": {
            "intro": "Flipping a house involves purchasing a relatively low-cost home (often a foreclosure), fixing it up, and selling it at a profit.[1] It is an endeavor that carries with it a number of risks as well as some potentially lucrative rewards. There is also a lot of hard work involved in getting a house ready for the market. If you are interested in flipping a home but do not have a lot of money for a down payment, there are other options that will allow you to enter the house-flipping market.",
            "steps": [
                "Evaluate your tolerance for risk. Flipping a house for profit involves a number of costs, including the home down payment, mortgage, interest payments, property taxes, real estate closing costs, inspections, permits, and contractors' fees.[2] These costs add up quickly, and the flipped house might not sell at a profit. Before you decide whether to go ahead with flipping a house, you should ask yourself:\n\n\nWhat will you do if the house does not sell right away? Would it be possible to use the house as a rental property, for example?[3] If you do not have a reasonable back-up plan if something goes wrong with the sale of the flipped house, you might want to reevaluate your plans.\nAre the potential profits worth the risk of a considerable loss? In 2015, houses priced below $50,000, saw negative returns. On the other hand, homes priced at $100,000 – $200,000, yielded an average gross return of 44%.[4] Keep in mind that selling a house in which you have never lived might also involve heavy tax payments, which can lower your profit margin considerably.[5]\n\nCan your investment partners weather the risk of a potential loss?\nHave you done your research on local real estate markets, remodeling costs, and permits? In order to have a successful house-flipping experience, you have to educate yourself on local home prices, school districts, responsible contractors, and real estate regulations.[6]",
                "Consider your ability to provide \"sweat equity,\" and the value of that work. Sweat equity refers to the amount of value you might add to your home due to your own labor.[7] For example, if you are a skilled roofer or licensed plumber, perhaps you can undertake some of the home repairs yourself. This will cut down on your overhead and reduce the amount of money you have to borrow.\n\n\nBe sure that you take into account the amount of time you'll spend working on the flipped house. Your time also has value, and flipping a house can sometimes take months of work.[8] Consider whether other ways of spending your time might be more lucrative or more enjoyable.\nMore importantly, will the partners putting up the financial stake consider that your sweat equity has any value? If so, how much value compared to their hard cash?\nBe sure to adhere to all local regulations when you undertake home repairs yourself. Discuss your plans with a real estate attorney or local regulations board if you require approval for any construction or repairs.",
                "Know your credit score. If you do not have money for a flipped house yourself, you will need to take out a loan to cover your initial costs. No matter who your lender is — a partner, a bank, or a private lender — you will have to demonstrate that you have the capability of repaying your loan. Your credit score reflects your credit history, your ability to pay off your loans, and your overall debt load. The better your credit score, the better the chances that you will be able to secure a loan at an affordable interest rate.\n\n\nThere are a few different credit rating systems, but in general your credit score will be a number somewhere between 300-850.[9] The higher your score, the better your credit is.\nYou can get a free report with your credit score every 12 months by visiting https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action .",
                "Improve your credit score. If your credit score is too low for you to be able to secure loans for a house-flipping venture, you might want to take some time to improve your credit score. This can take some time, but it might be worthwhile in the long run. Moreover, the better your credit score is, the more likely it is that you will be able to weather a potential loss from house-flipping. To improve your credit score you can:\n\n\nPay off your debts in a timely way. If you do not have a good history of paying off your debt, you will not be able to secure a decent loan for a flipped house.[10]\n\nKeep your overall debt load to a minimum. Avoid maintaining a credit card balance if you can.[11]\n\nOnly have credit lines when absolutely necessary. Do not have more credit cards than you require for your day-to-day life.[12]\n\nProtect your identity. Monitor your credit card transactions and your credit rating to make sure that your identity has not been stolen by a thief or a hacker. Take reasonable security precautions to protect your information. For example, do not log into your online banking system unless you are on a secure, password-protected network.[13]",
                "Talk to a financial advisor. A financial advisor will be able to look at your current financial situation and help you determine how much risk you can afford to take on as part of a house-flipping investment. A financial advisor might also be able to help you come up with a plan for meeting your expenses even if your flipped house takes a long time to sell or requires extra repairs.",
                "Make a business plan. In order to flip a house successfully, you will have to make your decisions based on logic and research, not on your emotions. Before you begin the process of finding a lender and purchasing a house, it is wise for you to have a solid business plan in place. This plan should keep you on the right track for making a wise investment as well as provide confidence to your potential lenders and partners that you can make a profit. Your business plan should include:\n\n\nA maximum purchase price of the home that you will flip.\nA list of in-demand neighborhoods where you will target your search. Pay particular attention to school districts, neighborhood safety, and proximity to amenities such as shops and public transit.[14]\n\nA maximum cost of repairs and remodels that you can afford.\nA list of dependable, affordable, licensed contractors who can undertake repairs successfully.\nA reasonable estimate for the After Repair Value (ARV) of the flipped home. Ideally, the initial sales price will be no more than 70% of the home's ARV.[15]\n\nA sense of who your buyer is and what they want. Will your buyer likely be a retired couple? A young businessperson? A couple with children? Depending on the neighborhood, your potential buyers might want very different things out of a home. Consider who your likely buyer will be and what they might need out of their house. For example, if you are looking at flipping a home in a neighborhood with a great school district, you might consider a remodel that has young children in mind.[16]\n\nA specific buyer. In some cases, you might be able to line up a buyer before you flip the house. In this case, your risks are much lower as are your overhead costs.[17]\n\nA plan for how to repay your loan if something goes wrong. Do not flip a house unless you can meet your expenses, even if something were to go wrong with your sale. For example, you might have a buyer fall through, or you might discover a problem with the foundation of the home. Build in a margin for error in your business plan, and brainstorm possible ways to weather a delay in the sale of the home or unexpected expenses.",
                "Locate an investment partner. The most common way for inexperienced house-flippers to enter the market is to find an investment partner. This is especially important for those who do not have the money for the down payment or initial repairs.[18] An investment partner will supply some or all of the start-up cash in exchange for a share of the profits.[19]\n\nYou might consider finding a partner who has a great deal of liquid cash but no interest in doing the legwork for purchasing or refinishing a home. While your partner will supply the cash, you will supply the know-how and labor.[20]",
                "Network actively. In order to find an investment partner, you should develop a number of personal and professional contacts in your community. Spread the word that you are interested in undertaking an investment opportunity with a partner. Some ways that you can locate potential partners include:\n\n\nResearching active real estate investors. Get in touch with successful, experienced real estate investors who might consider taking a chance on you.\nJoining a Real Estate Investment Club. Many local communities have local chapters of real estate investment clubs. Once you join, you will have access to locals who might share your interests and enthusiasms.[21]\n\nJoining a meetup group. Meetup groups are social clubs that sometimes have specific themes, including real estate. Use a meetup group to extend your social network.\nSpreading the word among family and friends. Discuss your dream of flipping houses with those who are already in your social network, such as family, friends, and coworkers. They might be able to put you in touch with others who share your interests or who are looking to invest in real estate.\nCreating your own real estate investment club. If your neighborhood does not yet have a real estate investors' club, you can form your own chapter.[22] Advertise on Craigslist and through meetup websites in order to find like-minded individuals.",
                "Consult an attorney. When you enter into an investment partnership, it is important that you do not simply rely on verbal agreements. Make sure all transactions are reflected in a signed contract. Consult a business or real estate attorney to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the arrangement. Make sure you work out in advance:\n\n\nWho covers which costs\nHow the profits will be split\nWho will cover potential debts and liabilities\nWho will undertake particular tasks (such as hiring contractors)\nNote security laws that regulate promotion of investments as well as the possibility of investor lawsuits if events don't occur as planned",
                "Take it one deal at a time. Some real estate partnerships work spectacularly; others completely fail. Do not lock yourself into a partnership over the long term before you know how well you work with your partner. Instead, take it one house at a time, and evaluate whether your partnership has the potential to be a strong and lasting one.[23] Take into account whether or not the financial return worked as expected.",
                "Research hard money lenders. A hard money lender is a company who borrows money from individuals at one interest rate and loans that money to other private individuals at a much higher interest rate.[24] There are many companies that specialize in funding real estate investments such as flipped houses.[25] Use your social network or internet directories to locate a hard money lender in your area.",
                "Recognize the added costs of hard money loans. A hard money loan is likely the easiest kind of loan to secure for a first-time home-flipper who does not have a lot of liquid cash. However, it is also one of the riskier options.[26] The interest rates from hard money loans tend to be much higher than typical bank mortgages at 8-15%. This can seriously cut into your potential profits from a flipped house.[27]",
                "Collect your financial documents. Before a hard money lender will loan you the cash, you will have to provide them with key information about your financial stability as well as your plans for flipping the house.[28] They will likely want to examine your tax records, credit rating, and pay stubs. Have your documents at hand to demonstrate to your lender that you are a worthwhile investment opportunity for them.",
                "Pay an initial 2-10% fee. Another added cost of hard money loans is the initial fee, often referred to as \"points.\" Most fees are between 2-10% of the mortgage cost of the house you will flip. This money provides your lender with some security and serves as a demonstration of your financial viability.[29]",
                "Flip the house quickly. Most hard money loans are limited to purchase and rehabilitation of property or construction, and might last from six to 24 months. Hard money loans are not suitable for longer-term investments because of the high fees involved. It is best to use hard money loans on properties that you will be able to turn around quickly to ensure that you are not paying sky-high interest rates.[30]",
                "Consider a private lender. A private lender is an individual with liquid money to spare who is willing to lend you money at a predetermined interest rate.[31] Unlike a real estate partner who splits the profits with you, a private lender will simply charge you an interest rate before providing you with the cash. In many cases, the interest rates for a private lender are lower than a hard money lender. However, a private lender might be more difficult to find.[32]",
                "Tap your social network for lenders. In many cases you can find a private lender through your own social network. If you know of a relative, friend, or coworker who has liquid cash just sitting around, you might be able to borrow this money and pay them interest. In an ideal scenario, everybody wins: your lender will be able to earn some extra interest, and you will be able to make a profit from your flipped house.[33]",
                "Be aware of potential risks. If you are going to secure a private lender, be sure that both you and your lender are aware of the potential risks of this transaction. Consider what might happen if you do not profit from the flipped house. Will you still be able to make your interest payments? Think through your options before seeking a private lender. In order to preserve your relationship with that person, you will have to pay them back in a timely way.",
                "Remember that trust is key. Do not take advantage of a private lender if you want to continue working with them.[34] Trust is the key ingredient of private loans, and you have to demonstrate that you can hold up your end of the bargain. If you are successful, your private lender might be willing to help you finance future real estate investments.",
                "Ask your bank for a loan. This option is less likely to occur during your first house-flipping experience, but it is worth a shot. If you have good credit and a solid business plan, your bank might be able to provide you with a loan to purchase a house to flip. These interest rates will likely be higher than a typical mortgage with a 20% down payment, but they will likely be lower than many hard money loans.[35]\n\nA bank is more likely to lend construction funds if you can provide a clear lien on the property.",
                "Discuss your business plan with your bank. If you have any hope of securing a bank loan, you will require a rock-solid business plan. Be sure to discuss your research with your bank to see if they consider you a worthwhile investment.",
                "Evaluate your current assets. Even if you do not have a lot of liquid cash to flip a house, you might still have assets that can help you get lines of credit to purchase a low-cost home to flip.[36] Examine your own home, your retirement accounts, and your credit lines to see if any of these can be tapped for a down payment.",
                "Tap your IRA. An IRA (Independent Retirement Account) is a retirement vehicle. There are serious tax penalties for withdrawing money before the age of 59.5. However, there are exceptions for first-time homebuyers. You can use up to $10,000 of your IRA to purchase a home. Discuss this option with your financial advisor to make sure that you are using the money properly and that you will not incur penalties.[37]\n\nKeep in mind that withdrawing money from your IRA might hurt the long-term growth potential of this retirement account. Beware of the risks involved in diminishing your retirement accounts too early.",
                "Consider a Home Equity Line of Credit. A home equity line of credit (or HELOC) is a potential option for you if you already own a piece of property. A HELOC provides you with a fast source of cash, and you only have to pay interest on the money that you borrow from the HELOC.[38] For example, you might have a HELOC that is worth $75,000. But if you borrow $10,000 of that amount, you only pay interest on the $10,000 amount.[39]\n\nBe very careful with your HELOC: if you do not repay your loan in a timely way, you are in danger of losing your home.[40]\n\nBe aware that HELOC interest rates might be higher than loans from private lenders.",
                "Consider using credit cards. Credit cards are another source of quick cash, as long as you plan on paying them off very quickly. The interest rates on credit cards can be very high at 18-20%. However, you are not placing any of your other assets at risk, as you would with a HELOC. You might consider using credit cards for lower-stake purchases during the flipping of a home, such as to purchase building materials from a home goods store.[41]"

        "wikiHow to Accept Honest Criticism from Your Partner": {
            "intro": "Criticism is hard to hear at any time. But it’s especially tough when it comes from your partner, someone that you love and respect. To accept honest criticism from your partner, remember that the aim is not to tear you down but to build up your relationship together. To do this you’ll need to lower your defenses, seriously listen to the criticism, and try to empathize.",
            "steps": [
                "Remind yourself it’s not a zero-sum game. No one likes to be criticized. It can be very hard to hear how you’ve failed to meet your partner’s expectations – you might feel unfairly blamed, misunderstood, or attacked. However, think about the reason you and your partner are communicating in the first place.[1]\n\nKeep in mind that your relationship shouldn’t be a power-struggle. The fact that your partner has an honest criticism doesn’t mean that you are “losing.”\nTell yourself, in the same way, that criticism isn’t a zero-sum game. The point is to establish some give and take and hopefully improve your relationship.",
                "Don’t interrupt. You’ll never be able to accept honest criticism from a partner unless you start to lower your defenses, listen, and empathize. Give your partner the floor, for one thing. Don’t interrupt to deny, refute, or turn back the criticism. This is a huge sign that you’re being defensive.[2]\n\nTry this trick: count to ten every time that you are tempted to interrupt. There’s a fair chance that once you’re done the moment will have passed and your point won’t matter anymore. Count higher if you still feel the urge, to twenty or thirty.\nStop yourself deliberately and apologize if you do interrupt. Cut yourself off, express regret for your rudeness, and let your partner resume.",
                "Disarm other defensive tactics. People have a whole arsenal of defensive tactics that they use to ignore or deflect criticism. Learn to recognize what these are, how you use them, and how to disarm them. Once you’ve done so, you’ll be better able to listen and create an open dialogue for honest criticism.[3]\n\nDo you placate or outright deny, saying “Sure honey, whatever you say” or “No, I don’t do anything of the sort”? Or do you ignore the criticism or stonewall: “Well, that’s just how I am. Deal with it.” None of these tactics allow for an exchange of honest criticism.\nSome defensive tactics are less obvious and rely on manipulation. They can include invalidation – “Why are you making such a big deal out of this? – as well as guilting, for instance, “Why are you being so cruel? What about how I feel?” Other tactics shift responsibility to the criticizer: “Maybe I wouldn’t have to be this way if you were nicer.”\nNotice any other tactics you might use, like excuses or neutralizing the criticism – “I didn’t mean to upset you. You’ve taken it the wrong way.”",
                "Pay attention to your non-verbal signals. One big way that people communicate how they feel is through non-verbal signals like body language. Note how you’re carrying yourself, not just what you’re saying to your partner – this means body language, tone of voice, facial expression, eye contact, and how far away you’re sitting.[4]\n\nMaintain eye contact with your partner. Looking away will make you seem standoffish, disinterested, or ashamed.\nTry not to fold your arms, either, or to face away from your partner. This gives the impression that you’re defensive and closed off.\nBe aware of your facial expression and try to remain neutral. A raised eyebrow or pursed lips can signal judgement or disagreement to your partner.\nUse a normal, steady, conversational tone of voice. Raising your voice signals that you are emotional and seeking to escalate the conversation.",
                "Ask to postpone the conversation. You may find that you can’t lower your defenses to give your partner a fair hearing. If you’re in a heightened emotional state, you might ask to excuse yourself and resume later. After all, neither of you will get much out of a defensive back and forth.\n\n\nSay something politely to excuse yourself. For instance, “I’m really sorry Terry. I want to have this talk, but I’m not feeling up to it just now. Can we continue in an hour or two?”\nBe sure to affirm the importance of the conversation, too, e.g. “I know this is important and something you want to say. I just don’t feel so calm right now. Let’s try later, OK?”\nTake responsibility for initiating the conversation again once you’ve calmed down and approach your partner to let them know you are ready to continue.\nPostponing the conversation does not mean avoiding it. In fact, chronic postponing can be another defensive tactic: “You’re going to bring that up again? I’m too busy to talk about it now.”[5]",
                "Try not to take it personally. Yes, this is a big challenge. How can you avoid taking your partner’s criticisms personally, especially when they are about you and your behavior? Think of it this way: your partner isn’t criticizing to attack or belittle you but speaking out with love to improve your relationship. Give your partner the benefit of the doubt.[6]\n\nTry to understand why you feel personally attacked. Is it because you feel like your partner is being unfair or exaggerating? Maybe you feel insecure or ashamed?\nTry also to think about why your partner would raise criticisms. Your romantic partner is probably not trying to make you look bad or shame you, but just wants to reach you. Honest criticism is about communication, love, and growth.",
                "Hold your tongue and listen. There are oftentimes when you’re being criticized that you want to snap back and explain yourself. Try to use self-control. Listen and, as said, don’t interrupt. Interjecting every few seconds with “but…but” only makes it seem like you don’t care and don’t want to listen to what your partner says.[7]\n\nHold your tongue if you have the urge to say “but…” If it helps, try actually biting down gently on your tongue or on your lower lip.\nIf you must say something, ask questions that make you express what your partner is saying instead, like “I just want to get this straight, you don’t think that I help around the house enough?” or “Do I understand correctly, you think we spend too much time with my parents?”",
                "Ask for concrete examples. You’ll understand and digest your partner’s honest criticism better if, instead of getting angry, you ask questions. Ask your partner to be more specific, to give examples, and to elaborate. This will help you to actually listen to the criticism and to show that you are interested in your partner’s views.[8]\n\nTry saying something like, “What is it exactly that makes you feel I’m too emotionally distant, Alex?” or “Can you give me a specific example of when you felt I was being selfish?”\nKeep in mind that you’re asking questions to understand your partner’s criticism. You’re not asking so that you can turn the criticism around or nitpick. This is another defensive tactic you should try to disarm.",
                "Resist the urge to counter-attack. Accepting your partner’s criticism will take honesty and openness. You won’t get anywhere if your immediate reaction is to lash out and criticize back. This, too, is a defensive tactic and will only escalate the situation, leading to frustration.[9]\n\nTry not to give in to the temptation to attack your partner, e.g. “You don’t think I help out enough around here? I never see you cleaning the garage and yard!” or “You’re being unreasonable. You do lots of things that annoy me, too!”\nDon’t deflect the criticism by trying to justify or normalize it, either. For example: “I don’t see what the problem is. My friend Jen goes out drinking every night of the week.”",
                "Listen to your partner’s words. Being able to accept honest criticism requires you to show empathy for your partner. This means to stand in your partner’s shoes and try to see and feel things as he or she does, if only partially. To do this, try using the techniques of active listening as an aid.[10]\n\nFirst of all, focus your attention on what your partner is saying. You don’t need to say or do anything. Just listen and allow your partner to talk.\nListening means just that – no talking for a while. You shouldn’t try to interject your opinion. Instead, send verbal and non-verbal signals that you’re listening by things like nodding, acknowledging important points, or by saying things like, “Mmmhmmm,” “Yes,” and “I see.”",
                "Suspend judgement. Empathy requires you to temporarily leave your own mental space and try to enter your partner’s and suspend your own perspective and opinions. This is definitely a challenge. But, by doing it you’ll be better able to focus on your partner’s feelings and appreciate the honest criticism.[11]\n\nSuspending your judgement doesn’t mean you have to accept your partner’s viewpoint. You can decide to disagree. But, for now, it means you need to push away your own views, opinions, and reactions.\nEmpathizing with your partner involves affirmation, too. Don’t disregard your partner’s criticisms by insisting that they are wrong or not important, like by saying “Well, that just isn’t a big deal” or “Oh, get over it!”\nKeep in mind that the point of listening isn’t always to offer a solution, either. Your partner has an honest criticism. There may be a solution in the future, but the key thing now is to hear your partner out.",
                "Repeat your partner’s meaning. Repeating what your partner says to you, in your own words, will help you to engage with the criticism actively. Stay respectful, for one. Then, restate and reformulate your partner’s points to be sure that you’ve understood correctly.[12]\n\nSay that your partner makes a point in your discussion. Try to repeat back what you’ve heard in different words. For instance, “OK, what I hear is that you think I’m being a bit selfish. Is that correct?” or “What I think you to mean is that you’re frustrated by my emotional distance.”\nYou can add questions to expand the discussion, as well. For example, you might say, “What is it about my relationship with my mom that you find so frustrating?” This will help you both communicate further.",
                "Affirm your partner. Lastly, try to let your partner know that you have heard by signaling this verbally. Say that you’ve listened and understood the criticism and will give it serious thought. Even if you don’t agree with what your partner has said, at least affirm that it is important. This way, you leave the door open for future discussions.[13]\n\nFor example, you can say something along the lines of “I don’t necessarily agree, Tasha, but I respect your point of view.” Or, “Thank you for being honest with me, Juan. I’ll consider what you’ve said.”\nTry to summarize your partner's viewpoint, along with your own so that you are on the same page. For example, “I see, so when I don’t change the toilet paper roll you feel like I’m being lazy and taking advantage, and to me it’s just something I don’t think about doing and don’t see why it’s important. Does that sum it up?”\nIf you both agree on your positions, try to come up with a workable solution you can both stick to. For example, “Ok, I could see how my actions could come off as being lazy, how about I put up a reminder in the bathroom to put on a new roll when it gets low?”"

        "wikiHow to Make a Balloon Arch": {
            "intro": "Balloon arches are a great addition to just about any party or event. They look impressive and complex, but they are actually quite simple to make. You can make a basic balloon arch with regular balloons or a floating one with helium balloons. You can even mount an arch onto your wall using chicken wire. Whichever arch you choose, you are bound to impress your guests!",
            "steps": [
                "Find or create a wire base. Use wire cutters to cut a long piece of sturdy wire to the length and height you want the arch to be. You can also purchase a balloon arch kit from the store, and use the wire frame from there.\n\n\nBecause wire gets flimsier the longer you cut it, this method is best used for smaller arches.",
                "Anchor the arch. Stick the ends of the arch into a bucket filled with gravel, pebbles, or sand. If you bought a pre-made arch from the store, it may already have a flat, base or platform. In this case, place something heavy, such as a brick or cinderblock on the base to weigh it down.\n\n\nAdd a thin layer of colored sand or pebbles to your bucket. This will hide the plain sand or pebbles.\nWrap bricks or cinderblocks in paper that matches your balloons. You can also paint them to match the base of your balloon arch.",
                "Blow up four balloons with a balloon pump. They can all be the same color, or they can be different ones. Tie the tail end of each balloon into a knot as soon as you finish blowing it up. Try to make each balloon the same size.[1]\n\nUse a regular pump for this method, not a helium tank.\nYou don't have to use a balloon pump for this, but your lungs may get tired after a while.",
                "Tie two balloons together by the tails in a double-knot. If you are having trouble with this, you can tie the balloons together using string instead. Repeat this step for the remaining two balloons. You should now have two balloon pairs.[2]",
                "Twist the balloon pairs together to make a clover shape. Place your first set of balloons over the second one in a cross shape. Pull the bottom two balloons upward. Pull the left one to the right, and the right one to the left. You will have something that looks like a four-leaf clover.[3]\n\nAlternatively, you can tie the balloons together in a cross shape with some string.",
                "Tie or twist the balloons to your wire. Pull the balloon clover against the wire. Make sure that the wire is resting against the knot in the middle of the clover. Twist the two adjacent balloons together so that they close in front of the wire.[4]\n\nYou can also secure the balloons to the wire with string or colorful ribbon.",
                "Repeat the process to make more rows. Blow four balloons at a time. Twist them into sets, then twist the sets together to make a clover. Slide the clover onto the wire, just above the bottom row of balloons, and secure it. Keep doing this until the wire is filled.[5]\n\nYou can use all the same color or you can alternate colors.\nStagger the balloons. Let the balloons in row two rest in the cracks between the balloons in row one.[6]",
                "Tie a long piece of fishing line to a balloon weight. Choose a balloon weight that matches your color scheme. Wrap the end of the fishing line a few times around the handle, then tie it into a secure knot.[7] Don't tie down the other end yet.\n\n\nIf you can't find any fishing line, use white string instead. You can also use balloon ribbon that matches your color scheme.\nIf you are making a large balloon arch, tie the string to a bucket handle instead. Fill the bucket with sand, gravel or pebbles.\nYou can also tie string to a cinderblock if you are making a large balloon arch.",
                "Inflate a balloon using a helium tank. Unlike other arches, this arch relies on floating balloons for structure. Blow up your first balloon using the tank, then tie off the tail end.[8]\n\nYou can buy a helium tank from a party supply store or an arts and crafts store. Some places will also allow you to rent them instead.",
                "Tie the fishing line to the balloon. Measure up abut 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) from your weight. Wrap the string around the tail end of the balloon, just above the knot, then tie it in a secure, double-knot.[9]",
                "Continue inflating and tying the balloons to the string. Place the balloons close enough so that they bump against each other on the sides.[10] Work from one end of the string to the other. Leave about 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) of space at the end of the string empty.\n\n\nIf you used a cinderblock as your anchor, you will need to leave enough string to feed it through the holes on the block and tie it off.",
                "Anchor the other end of the string. Measure 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) from the last balloon. Wrap the string a few times around the handle of your balloon anchor, then tie it into a secure knot.",
                "Add ribbon to the bottom of each balloon, if desired. This is a cute touch that will make it look like the balloons are floating in an orderly fashion. Cut a length of balloon curling ribbon in a contrasting color, then tie it to the bottom of each balloon. For extra flair, use a pair of scissors to curl the ribbon.[11]",
                "Decorate heavier balloon anchors, if desired. Small balloon anchors often look like little gift boxes and are pretty enough on their own. If you used a bucket or cinderblock to anchor a large arch, however, you may want to decorate it. Here are some ideas:\n\n\nCover cinderblocks with wrapping paper.\nPaint the bucket with spray paint or acrylic paint.\nFill the top layer of your bucket with colored sand or gravel.\nTuck flowers into the bucket or cinderblock.",
                "Use wire cutters to cut chicken wire for your arch. How long you cut the chicken wire depends on how wide and how tall you want your arch to be. If the chicken wire is very wide, you may want to cut it narrower. This will make it easier to bend and curve it into an arch shape.",
                "Bend the chicken wire into the shape you want it to be. It can be a perfect arch or a warped one. If you need to, loosely crumple or fold the wire in half lengthwise to make it thinner.[12]",
                "Secure the arch to your wall. You can do this with nails, thumb tacks, or pushpins. Start at one end of the chicken wire and work your way upwards to the peak, then work your way back down to the other end.[13]\n\nThe arch does not have to be perfectly symmetrical. Try a warped arch for a more organic design.",
                "Blow up your balloons using a balloon pump. For a more interesting design, blow up balloons in different sizes and colors. Try some water balloons, regular balloons, and jumbo balloons. You can also blow up regular balloons with varying amounts of air.[14]\n\nDo not use a helium tank for this.\nYou can blow the balloons up with your mouth, but your lungs may get tired.",
                "Secure the first balloon to the base of the arch. Place a glue dot to the tail end of the balloon, just below the knot. Wrap the tail behind the wire, then press it against the knot. Hold the tail and knot together for about 10 seconds before letting go. This ensures a secure bond.[15]\n\nYou can find glue dots in the scrapbooking section or an arts and crafts store. They are dots of glue that come on a strip. Peel them off one at a time as you use them.",
                "Attach the next balloon in a similar fashion. Make sure that you place it close enough to the first balloon so that they are touching. Find the spot where the two balloons touch, then place another glue dot between them.[16]",
                "Work your way around the arch. Create clusters of balloons. Start with the larger ones first, then work your way towards the smaller ones. You can even place smaller balloons over larger ones using glue dots.[17]",
                "Consider adding fillers. Dried or fresh flowers work especially well for this, but you can use fake ones too. You can also tuck some colorful ribbon in between the balloons instead. This is also a great way to hide any gaps and give your balloon arch a more organic feel.\n\n\nSecure the flowers to the chicken wire with glue dots or string.[18]\n\nMake sure that the flowers don't have any thorns. If they do, cut them off with a crafting blade."

        "How to Deal With Stress": {
            "intro": "Life can be stressful; sometimes you'll have to deal with ongoing stress positively. Stress can have a variety of causes such as family problems, job problems, financial difficulties, poor health, or even the death of someone close to you. It is important to recognize the causes (some stress is natural), take steps to deal with the root of the problem, and tackle the symptoms. Most importantly, don't battle stress alone — ask for help from a friend and, if necessary, a professional.",
            "steps": [
                "Exercise regularly. Targeted exercise goes a long way toward freeing your body of stress hormones and increasing your endorphin levels - responsible for feelings of happiness. Carve out time during your busy day to exercise to both keep your body healthy and as a natural outlet for your stress. You should notice the difference.[1]\n\nTry to raise your heartbeat to 120-180 beats per minute for about 30 minutes per day. If you don't have time to do all thirty minutes in one sitting, don't worry; you can break up the exercise time however you need to fit your schedule.\nWalking for even 20-30 minutes each day is sufficient if that's all that you can afford. Walking isn't just good for stress-reduction: Adults over 40 who walked briskly for at least 150 minutes a week saw their life expectancy increase by 3.4 – 4.5 years.[2]\n\nSwimming, hiking, and biking have been shown to reduce stress as well. A benefit of swimming and biking is that, opposed to jogging, they create far less joint strain, which makes them perfect for people with joint problems or those wanting to prevent them.[3]",
                "Get enough sleep. Give your body the sleep it wants, and your stress levels will take a nosedive. Sleep is a mechanism by which your body recuperates and restores its energy reserves. If you're not getting enough sleep, your body will use stress to keep you active and alert in the absence of stored energy.\n\n\nMost adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.[4] Young children and older adults need more, about 9-10 hours of sleep per night.\nGet into regular sleeping habits. If you can, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each night and morning. Routinizing your sleep cycle will teach your body when it's supposed to go to be tired, aiding in better sleep and less sleep deprivation.\n49% of Americans who don’t get enough sleep blame stress as the culprit.[5] If you believe that you're stuck in a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation/stress creation, see your doctor for more targeted advice.",
                "Eat properly. Your body needs to be healthy, strong, happy and properly fueled to help you tackle stress. Like it or not, stress is a bodily reaction to anything that disturbs its natural state, meaning that your body can have a profound effect on producing and relieving stress.\n\n\n\nWater has been shown to relieve stress.[6] That's because a dehydrated body creates cortisol, a stress hormone. An under-hydrated body creates stress to motivate the owner of the body to properly care for him/herself.\n\nStart decreasing caffeine and alcohol intake. In some cases, alcohol intake increases stress response in humans while being linked to substance dependency, a stressful condition itself.[7]Caffeine is also responsible for raising stress levels, especially at work[8], so try to stick to water as a general rule.\nEat a healthy breakfast and healthy snacks during the day. It is better to eat several smaller meals throughout the day than to consume three large meals.[9]\n\nFor a healthy stress-free diet, consume more complex carbohydrates such as whole-grain breads and pasta, foods high in vitamin A such as oranges, foods high in magnesium like spinach, soybeans or salmon, and black and green tea, which contain antioxidants.",
                "Learn to relax. Relaxing your body, by whatever natural means, is a great way to reduce stress. Don't expect your stress to immediately dissipate; it can take time. In most cases, try not to fixate on the stress itself while you're relaxing. Think of something placid and tranquil, or think of nothing in particular. Let your body tell your mind that everything is okay.\n\n\nListen to calm and soft music. Music really gets you relaxed and happy. Try listening to music with no vocals and pick music with instruments like the flute, piano, or violin. Classical, jazz, or folk tunes generally work well, but if that's not your cup of tea, choose music that puts you in a good place.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Stress Step 4Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8e/Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/aid31290-v4-728px-Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\n\nTake a bath. Add Epsom salts or other fragrant bath salts for a luxurious touch. Indulge in your private time and relax the body.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Stress Step 4Bullet2\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1f/Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet2-Version-2.jpg/aid31290-v4-728px-Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet2-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nGet a massage. Either having a professional massage or con a loved one into giving you a stress-relieving massage. Use lotions or oils and dim ambient light for the most relaxing atmosphere.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Deal With Stress Step 4Bullet3\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet3-Version-2.jpg/aid31290-v4-728px-Deal-With-Stress-Step-4Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nStart a diary or journal. You don't have to write in it every day.

                "Practice yoga and meditation. Although you could technically consider yoga your daily exercise, practicing the deep stretches and slow body movements will help you to clear your mind. Meditating - clearing your mind - while practicing gentle yoga will give double the relaxation effect to ease your stress.\n\n\nUse guided imagery to imagine a place that makes you feel at peace. Imagine somewhere that you feel happy; focus on the details to fully remove your mind from the present.\nDo yoga alone or in a group setting to help you learn new poses. As you advance in your yoga, you will be able to form complex stretches that force you to focus and take your mind off your stress.\n\nPractice deep relaxation by doing progressive muscle relaxation. This is when you work through your body by tensing your muscles, holding the tension for ten seconds, and then releasing it. This will soften and relieve all the muscles in your body.",
                "Do things you love. Often when you're stressed, you can look at your schedule and see that you are lacking time for doing your favorite activities. Whether that be drawing, writing, reading, playing sports, or cooking, set aside time on a daily basis to do those things you enjoy.\n\n\nTry picking up a new hobby to help you relieve your stress. If you've always wanted to learn how to ride horses or build model airplanes, then do it! Learning something new will take your mind off of whatever is bothering you, and give you a new hobby to enjoy.\nIf you have a very busy schedule, set aside at least just ten minutes per day to do what you enjoy. Although ideally you should spend thirty minutes to an hour, allowing just a small break from your hectic schedule will be enough to lower your stress levels.[10]",
                "Avoid negative thinking. Acknowledge the positive in your life and begin to re-establish some balance in your emotional register. Avoid focusing on only the bad things that happened during your day, but consider the good as well.\n\n\nStop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things.\nSay something positive to yourself as soon as you wake up every morning. This will keep your energy and mind focused on positive thinking. Be thankful for each day that you have; you never know which one could be your last!\nUse positive self-talk. Reinforce your resolve through positive statements such as, \"I can handle this, one step at a time,\" or \"Since I've been successful with this before, there's no reason why I can't do it again.\"\nVisualize positive things; this does not take long but can help you regain focus. Think about success, read about successful people. Don't admit defeat before you've been defeated. You don't deserve to beat yourself down so that you can punish yourself.",
                "Organize your life. Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a \"to do list\". Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel.\n\n\nKnow your limits. Be realistic about what you can and can't accomplish in a day. It's not helpful if you bite off more than you can chew and then castigate yourself for not getting it done.\n\nPrioritize your tasks. Work on finishing the highest priority (most urgent/important) items first. Put low priority items on the bottom of your list.\nDo your most unpleasant or most difficult task at the beginning of the day when you are fresh, thereby avoiding the stress of last minute preparation. Procrastination feeds stress!\nEmphasize quality in your work, rather than sheer quantity. Take pride in having done something well as opposed to having done a lot of something.\n\nSchedule your day, if possible, so that stressful scenarios don't overlap, reducing the number of stressors you must juggle at any one time. Stagger deadlines for large projects.\nReview your goals at the end of the day and think about everything you have achieved. This is cathartic and will help you sleep better. Check off the things that you accomplished on the to do list.",
                "Identify the things that put you under stress. Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful.\n\n\nIf you notice, for example, that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress. If the person is someone you love and trust, tell them how they make you feel in a non-threatening way. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your misgivings, remind yourself that the occasion is momentary, the feeling will pass, and you'll be in complete control soon.\nRehearse. When you know that you are going to face a stressful situation, rehearse how you are going to handle it. Picture yourself overcoming it successfully. Create a mental videotape that you can play over and over in your mind.",
                "Stop worrying about the things you cannot change. This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds.\n\n\nIs the problem a real problem you’re currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is your concern realistic? Can you do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of your control[11]\n\nAdmitting to yourself that there's nothing you can do about a particular issue will go a long way in helping you adjust. Acknowledge that maybe you feed off of stress, like an adrenaline junkie feeds off adrenaline, but that in your case, it's becoming unmanageable.",
                "Take responsibility for making your life what you want it to be. It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it!\n\n\n\nLearn to say no on occasion. You cannot do everything you are asked, and even if you could, you probably wouldn't want to.\nResist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego.\nDon't get down on yourself for failing if you tried your hardest. You gave it your all, and nobody would ask you for more. Hold yourself accountable, but don't make being accountable impossible.\nBe one of your own best friends. It may sound cheesy, like something out of a Leave it to Beaver commercial, but it's true: Love yourself, depend (mostly) on yourself, and celebrate the things you do well. Loving yourself will ease the anxious question \"Am I good enough?\" and replace it with \"I know I'm good enough.\"",
                "Develop a sense of humor. One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress.\n\n\nLearn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time. How are you expected to laugh at other things if you can't even laugh at yourself?",
                "Learn to lean on friends and loved ones. This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible.\n\n\nAsk your friends for help. If you want something done but can't find the strength or the time to do it, it's okay to ask your friends or loved ones for help. Express your gratitude and extend the offer of help as a kind of reciprocity.\nLook for people's respect, not approval — your friends included. Your friends will respect you because they love you, even if they don't always agree with you. Your enemies (if you have any) will respect you because your motivations come from a sincere, heartfelt place. Resist the urge to be loved and accepted by everyone; it's literally a Herculean task. You'll find yourself a lot less stressed and a lot more satisfied if you do.\nSeek out positive people rather than negative ones. It sounds like a truism because it is: Surrounding yourself with people who are fun-loving, excited, and kind will help you avoid the stress you'd be feeling with pessimistic, cynical, mean people.",
                "Have more positive self talk. Nothing else helps intensify stress more than negative thoughts. When you start to having the feeling of defeat is the perfect time for a little reminder.\n\n\nYou know yourself better than anyone else, and you are the perfect person to give you the reminder that it will get better.\nRemind yourself of all of the things you have accomplished in the past. All of those small accomplishments add up to very big ones over time.\nChange the words you use. Instead of saying, \"I can't do this,\" say something like, \"I've been able to get through this before, and I will get through it this time too.\"",
                "If someone is threatening you and you have stress and anxiety, stand up to them and tell them how you feel.",
                "Tell someone you trust about your stress and tell them everything that is bothering you. Revealing yourself is a good way to express how you are feeling and how to deal with it.",
                "Get something like a stress relief ball or if you having a punching bag, go there everyday and yell at it or punch it. That can help you express your stress and then relax your body. Holding in emotions is not good for your body."

            "intro": "If you're planning a trip to Europe, you may want to buy Euros well in advance to take advantage of a more favorable exchange rate than you might find during your trip. Buying Euros online saves you from having to wait in line at the airport or the bank and usually saves in transaction fees.",
            "steps": [
                "Watch the exchange rate between the Euro and the currency used in your country. You want to be able to buy as many Euros as you can. Look up the current exchange rate and find out whether the rate is falling or rising. It may be helpful to look at a graph for the last few months to see how the Euro is performing against your currency.[1]\n\nDetermine which currency is being used to calculate the exchange rate; this is called the base currency. For instance, if you see this exchange rate: 1 EUR = 1.36 USD, that means it costs $1.36 American dollars to buy one Euro. The base rate is the first figure listed. Each country's currency has its own code.\nIf the base currency is American dollars and the exchange rate is 1 USD = .772 EUR, then it will cost you 100 American dollars to buy about 77 Euros. In this situation, the exchange rate is being calculated with the U.S. dollar as the base.",
                "Find a bank or foreign exchange firm that sells foreign currency. You can buy Euros with either an e-check (you enter the check information) or a credit card. The exchange rates will differ depending on your payment method. Be sure to check what the transaction and shipping fees are. You may want to browse several web sites to find one whose fees are acceptable.[2]\n\nSome sellers give you the current exchange rate but charge a fee for the transaction. Others offer an exchange rate that's less than the current rate to make money on the transaction.\nFor example, if the exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.29 EUR but the seller is offering an exchange rate of 1 USD = 1.22 EUR, then you will spend 100 U.S. dollars to buy 122 Euros from that seller. This is the same as if the seller charged seven Euros (or the dollar equivalent) for the transaction.",
                "Enter the shipping address. You must use the address that's associated with your bank or credit card account. Generally, the seller will not ship to post office boxes, and you will need to be available at the address to accept the package. If you can't be available, you may choose to pick up your Euros at a local bank branch.[3]",
                "Learn the symbols. You want to make sure you order the correct currency, so you’ll need to learn what symbols equate to euros. Sometimes euros are referred to by the abbreviation EUR. Other times they are represented by the symbol €.[4]",
                "Figure out what places use euros as their currency. In general, you’ll only be able to use euros in countries that use the euro as their national currency. Most countries in the European Union use the euro as currency. There are, however, some exceptions. Here is a list of countries that use euros as their currency[5]:\n\n\nAustria\nBelgium\nCyprus\nEstonia\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIreland\nItaly\nLatvia\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMalta\nthe Netherlands\nPortugal\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain",

There are coins and paper currency in the euro.\n\n\nYou might only want big bills so it’s easier to transport. Or you might want to get a collection of smaller bills so that they are easier to use for day-to-day expenses.\nYou might also consider whether or not you’ll need to order any euro coins. Many exchanges do not deal in coins. Luckily, it is quite easy to convert a paper Euro note into coins in the destination country.\nEuro bills come in the following denominations: €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, and €500.[6]",

Just notify your bank (in person or over the phone) that you’ll need to order some euros and tell them how much and what denomination of bills you want. Banks can usually get the foreign currency for you within a few business days.[7]\n\nSome banks will charge you a nominal fee for this service.[8]",

            "intro": "The word sea monkey is a brand name for a breed of brine shrimp, whose eggs are sold through the mail along with the materials necessary to hatch them. Since using the wrong amount of food can kill the entire tank relatively quickly, it's important to learn the correct feeding schedule, along with the signs of underfed or overfed brine shrimp.",
            "steps": [
                "Don't feed a new tank until 5 days after hatching. Sea monkeys begin life by feeding off the nutrients in their egg sac. Check on the eggs daily to see if they've begun to hatch. Once they have, wait five days before you start to feed them.[1]\n\nNewly hatched sea monkeys can be extremely small. Move your tank to a well-lit area and examine the water closely for tiny, pale, moving dots. Use a magnifying glass if necessary.\nIf the sea monkey eggs do not hatch within 48 hours, move the tank to an area with stronger light. Keep the tank away from direct sunlight, however, as this can cause it to overheat",
                "Feed the sea monkeys a tiny amount of Growth Food. Use the smaller end of the feeding spoon to pick up the food, and move one of these small spoonfuls into the tank.[2] If you do not have a feeding spoon, try using a clean plastic straw as a scoop. It's better to give them too little food than too much.",
                "Repeat the feeding once every five to seven days. Different handbooks vary in their instructions, but most sea monkey tanks will thrive when fed at intervals of five to seven days.[3] Only increase the feeding rate or amount if your sea monkey population grows much larger than the initial packet's population, and if there is no sediment on the base of the tank.",
                "Skip feedings if the water gets cloudy. If the water becomes cloudy or dirty-looking, stop feeding the shrimp. Wait until the water becomes clear again before adding food.[4] This cloudy appearance is usually the result of too much algae, bacteria, or other organisms that can suffocate the sea monkeys if they continue to grow.[5]",
                "Watch for a dark streak on the sea monkeys as a sign of health. Adult brine shrimp digestive tracks become dark when full. If you see this dark line running across a sea monkey's body, it is probably eating well.[6] If you do not, consider feeding them more often, but only as described below.",
                "Increase feedings cautiously. If you acquire more sea monkeys, or if the population grows, you may need to increase the amount of food or the frequency of feeding. Adjust slowly to avoid killing the tank's population through overfeeding. Reduce the interval between feeding sessions by one day at a time, returning to the old feeding schedule if the water becomes cloudy or the sea monkeys start acting sluggish or uninterested in food. Alternatively, keep the same feeding schedule but switch to the large end of the feeding spoon.",
                "To encourage growth, replace Growth Food with Super Food occasionally. Optionally, you may use Super Food instead of Growth food, but only once every few feeding sessions.[7] This is supposed to cause your sea monkeys to grow larger and more quickly.",
                "For more extreme growth, also feed Gro-Kwickly once a week. Gro-Kwickly is meant to be added with the small scoop no more than once per week, in addition to the ordinary food.[8] This may result in more rapid growth, although the company that makes these products does not explain the difference between this and Super Food.",
                "Use Red Magic instead of normal food, to turn your sea monkeys red. This packet claims to contain vitamins that make your sea monkeys healthier or more energetic. The most noticeable effect, however, may be the pink or red color that the sea monkeys develop. You may need to feed them Red Magic for several feeding sessions before this becomes visible.",
                "Use Banana Treat food instead of normal food occasionally (optional). The back of the Banana Treat packet claims that this food has extra nutrients, so it may not be as unhealthy as some human \"treats.\"[9] However, it appears that this product is only intended as an occasional treat to excite your sea monkeys, instead of regular food. If your sea monkeys are not excited by this food, there is probably no point in using it.",
                "Use Sea Medic if bacteria start growing in your tank. The Sea Medic packet is not a replacement for food. If you see white balls floating in your tank, fight this bacterial infection by adding Sea Medic daily with the small end of the feeding spoon, until the balls are gone.[10]"

Budget accordingly and only purchase your Rolex when you can comfortably afford such an expensive item.[1] Also note that:\n\n\nRolexes are often perceived as a status symbol, indicating a certain level of achievement in one’s life. So if you wish to impress people by suggesting that you have personally achieved this level (whether or not you actually have), Rolexes are certainly an option.\nHowever, be aware that there is also a stigma attached to flashing a Rolex as a sign of success.[2] Expect true enthusiasts to have a much more intimate knowledge of their timepieces beyond the pricetag.[3]",
                "Commemorate a milestone. Buy a Rolex to honor a special occasion. Mark a significant turning point in your personal life, or treat yourself after a major achievement in your career. Give yourself a carrot to follow so you have more time to save more money, rather than limiting yourself to the cheapest models as soon as you can afford one. Such occasions could include:[4]\n\nWeddings\nBirthdays\nAnniversaries\nPromotions\nRetirement",
                "Invest in a valuable commodity. Trust the resale value of a Rolex to remain relatively consistent over time.[5] Buy a timepiece with an eye toward the future, should you ever need an easy way to get hold of a significant sum of money fairly quickly. However:\n\n\nBe aware that, as with most investments, there are no guarantees. Although there is a heavy trade in used Rolexes, play it safe and assume that you won’t get all your money back if you buy a brand-new one.[6]",
                "Determine what you want out of a Rolex. First, ask yourself how often you plan to wear it: every day, in certain situations, or only very special occasions? Then review your style of dress in those circumstances. Lastly, consider whether this Rolex will be your only one, or the beginning of a collection.[7]\n\nIf this is to be your only Rolex, stick to classic designs. Avoid trendy elements that may grow out of date or would be hard to match with multiple outfits, such as irregular-sized cases or colored dials.",
                "Browse at a brick-and-mortar store. Visit dealers in person so you can try on different models. Deal directly with staff so they can answer any questions that you might have. Then take time to think about your options and preferences. With such a hefty price-tag, make sure you are buying the watch you want.[8]\n\nQuestions to ask include: What materials are the components made of? Where do I locate serial numbers? What other markers show that it is a genuine Rolex?\nTo find official Rolex dealers near you, visit https://www.rolex.com/rolex-dealers/dealer-locator/unitedstates#north=49.38&south=25.82&east=-66.94&west=-124.38999999999999",
                "Choose a model. Based on your intended use, choose a Rolex that will complement your fashion sense. Decide between models in three different categories of watches: sport, dress, and “showy.”[9]\n\nSport watches are ideal for everyday wear with casual attire. Models include the Daytona, Explorer I and II, GMT-Master II, Sea-Dweller Deepsea, Submariner, and Yachtmaster.\nDress watches are for more formal/business attire. These include the Air King, Datejust II, Day-Date II, and Oyster Perpetual.\n“Showy” watches incorporate more flashy design elements to standard models, such as precious metals and gems. These are best reserved for very special occasions or as collectibles.",
                "Decide between new and used. If you are first time buyer, think about these two primary considerations. Shop a new Rolex to ensure a working watch.[10] Or, purchase a used Rolex to (possibly) save money.[11] Other considerations include:\n\n\nWith new watches, you are able to buy directly from Rolex dealers, minimizing the risk of fakes. Also, contemporary designs are guaranteed.\nWith vintage watches, prices may actually rise due to scarcity of a particular model. There is also an increased chance that some elements have been replaced with other parts, which lowers its value.[12]",
                "Research your watch(es). Once you have decided on a watch (or narrowed your list down to a couple choices), learn as much as you can about the product. Especially make a point of this if you plan on purchasing it from a source other than an official dealer. Use resources like internet forums, trade publications, and books to find out identifying marks like:[13]\n\nLogos, fonts, and sizes.[14]\n\nReference numbers and where to find them.\nWhat engravings it should have, and where.\nMaterials used for luminescence.",
                "Decide where to shop. Now that you know more about what you want, choose where to make your purchase. For the easiest stress-free experience, buy directly from an official dealer for peace of mind.[15] If you shop elsewhere:\n\n\nResearch dealers through customer reviews and similar sources to eliminate iffy sellers.\nBeware dealers that offer no warranties, return policies, or other forms of buyer protection.[16]\n\nFor “showy” watches, prioritize official dealers, since the design elements of used watches may have been added after the fact by sources other than Rolex.[17]"

            "intro": "Hardwood board is sold in random widths and lengths, so you will need to calculate the board footage of any hardwood you plan to purchase. Board footage is actually a measurement of volume; as such, you'll need to know the length, width, and depth/thickness of the board to calculate it. The length can be in either inches or feet.",
            "steps": [
                "Measure the length, width, and depth in inches. Use a stiff tape measure to measure the length, width, and depth of the board. Each measurement should be taken separately and recorded in inches.\n\n\nUsing this method of calculation, you must know the length, width, and depth of each board in inches. Round fractional sizes to the nearest quarter-inch.\nNote that board thickness is always expressed in quarter-inches, even when you have a whole number. In other words, 1-inch thick board would be expressed as four-quarter (4/4) board. When calculating board feet, however, you should still use the actual measured number of inches for the sake of simplicity.\nIf you are buying pre-measured, marked hardwood from a reliable source, you can skip this step and begin your calculations. Measuring the hardwood board yourself is always recommended when possible, though.\n\nExample: Calculate board feet for five-quarter (5/4) hardwood measuring 26 inches long and 4.5 inches wide.\n\nNote that “five-quarter” hardwood is 1.25 inches thick.",
                "Multiply these three measurements together. Multiply the measured length, width, and depth of the board. Write down the product of all three measurements.\n\n\nDuring this part of the calculation, you are actually determining the volume of the board. As such, your answer will need to be in cubic inches.\n\nExample: length * width * depth = 26 inches * 4.5 inches * 1.25 inches = 146.25 cubic inches",
                "Divide the product by 144. Divide the product you just calculated by 144 cubic inches. Write down the quotient you calculate.[1]\n\nNote that 1 board foot equals 144 cubic inches. That is the reason you must divide the board volume—the number of cubic inches—by 144.[2]\n\n\nExample: 146.25 cubic inches / 144 cubic inches = 1.02 board feet",
                "Double check the result. You should now know the board feet of the hardwood you're looking at. Run through the calculations one more time to verify your answer.\n\n\n\nExample: Board feet = [length * width * depth] / 144 = [26 * 4.5 * 1.25] / 144 = 146.25 / 144 = 1.02 board feet",
                "Measure the length in feet. Use a stiff tape measure to measure the length of the board. Record this measurement in feet.\n\n\nWhen using this method of calculation, you need to know the length of the hardwood board in feet and not in inches. Fractional feet should be written as x / 12, with x equaling the number of inches.\nIt is always a good idea to measure the hardwood boards yourself before purchasing them. If you intend to buy pre-measured, marked hardwood boards from a trusted source, however, you can technically skip the measuring steps and jump directly into the calculations.\n\nExample: Calculate board feet for a piece of hardwood measuring 2-2/12 feet long.\n\nThe fraction here can be simplified, giving you a measurement of 2-1/6 feet.\nAlternatively, you can divide the fraction into a decimal, giving you a measurement of 2.17 feet.",
                "Measure the width and depth in inches. Use the same stiff tape measure to measure the width and depth of the same board. Take each measurement separately and record them both in inches.\n\n\nWidth and depth are both measured in inches, not in feet. Round fractional sizes to the nearest quarter-inch.\nBoard depth/thickness is referred to by the quarter-inch, so 1-inch thick board would be described as four-quarter board. You will still use the actual number of inches in your board feet calculation, though.\n\nExample: Calculate board feet for 2.17 feet of five-quarter (5/4) hardwood measuring 4.5 inches wide.\n\nNote that \"five-quarter\" hardwood is 1.25 inches thick.",
                "Multiply the three measurements together. Multiply the length measurement with the width and depth measurements. Write down the product of all three measurements.\n\n\nYou're actually calculating the volume of the board during this step. Since one of the measurements is not in inches, however, the product will not be in cubic inches. Instead, it will be in feet by squared inch (ft*in2).\n\nExample: length * width * depth = 2.17 feet * 4.5 inches * 1.25 inches = 12.21 ft/in2",
                "Divide the product by 12. Divide the product you just calculated by the number 12. Save the quotient you calculate during this step.[3]\n\nSince the calculated board volume is in ft*in2 instead of cubic inches, you cannot divide the volume by the amount of cubic inches per board foot (144 cubic inches).\nInstead, you must divide the volume by a measurement taken in ft*in2. There are 12 ft*in2 per board foot.\n\nExample: 12.21 ft/in2 / 12 ft/in2 = 1.02 board feet",
                "Double check the result. At this point, you've already calculated the board feet of the hardwood board in front of you. It is still a good idea to work through the same calculations one more time to verify the accuracy of your answer, though.\n\n\n\nExample: Board feet = [length * width * depth] / 12 = [2.17 * 4.5 * 1.25] / 12 = 12.21 / 12 = 1.02 board feet",
                "Calculate board feet for each piece of wood. Use either method of calculation to find the board feet of each piece of wood you plan to purchase.\n\n\nNote that this will only work if there is one consistent cost per board foot for each piece of wood included in your total board footage. Do not include boards priced at a different rate in your cost calculation.\n\nExample: Calculate the cost of three separate pieces of hardwood available at a price of $5.45 per board foot. The first piece is 4.3 board feet, the second is 6.8 board feet, and the third is an even 2 board feet.",

These won't leave your hair as dry or coarse as other dye types, even after bleaching.",
                "Use a flat iron to seal your hair color. Once the hair is freshly dyed, make sure you or your stylist goes over it with a flat iron after it's dried. This helps lock the color into the hair shaft.",

These hair care products are also dye-sucking vampires.\n\n\nIf your hair is particularly vibrant and unnatural (bright reds, purples, blues, greens, pinks, etc.), try to keep away from spending extended periods of exposure to sunlight and water. Sunlight has been known to work somewhat as a natural bleach, so be careful if you have any long beach trips or life guarding stints planned.",

A full school day, an afterschool club, practice for a sport, and homework can add up to a 12–14 hour day, at the very least. A planner will help you keep your schedule organized.[1]\n\nBefore the start of each week, write down everything that you plan on or need to do.\nGet to know yourself and how long it takes you to complete various tasks, and set your weekly plan accordingly.

Get in the habit of accomplishing a task on time, and if you say that you’re going to do something, then do it.[4]\n\nUse your weekly planner, daily to-do list, and long-term calendar to help you stay on top of your tasks and projects.\nAsk your friends to help motivate you to get things done instead of tempting you to put something off, and do the same for them.\nBeing proactive and learning early about how to get things done in a timely manner will help you stay in control later on in life, too.",
                "Understand the physical and emotional changes you’re going through. Your body and mind are transforming themselves. You’re full of hormones that make your emotions intense and difficult to regulate. You’re constantly in social situations at school and at home that exacerbate those emotions. Taking control of your life also means recognizing what’s out of your control: this is an awkward, rocky time in your life. It’s important to accept that.[5]\n\nThe neurological and hormonal changes and developments in your body can make it difficult to control and cope with your emotions. You may feel overwhelmed, confused, and out of control. Know that this is normal, and there are things you can do to help you stay healthy and cope.\nUnderstand that adolescence is something everyone goes through, so don’t be too critical of yourself.\nDon’t be too concerned about judgment from your peers or from adults. At some point, you will look silly, say something awkward, trip and fall, and so on: it's part of the deal.",
                "Eat right. Growing and developing take lots of energy, and getting through a packed schedule demands even more. It’s essential to eat a well-balanced diet to fuel your growth and productivity. Never skip any meals, and always make sure to eat breakfast to get your day going on a full tank.[6]\n\nHalf of what you eat should be fruits and veggies. Balance the rest of your diet out with whole grains, like whole grain bread, brown rice, or oatmeal, and lean proteins, like turkey, chicken, seafood, and eggs.\nTalk to your doctor to learn more about your specific dietary needs.\nThere’s no “right” number of calories to eat, and no universal portion size for everyone. If you’re a very active boy, you’ll need to eat more than a less active girl. Get to know your body’s needs and take this time while you’re young to establish long-lasting healthy habits.[7]\n\nTeens should not go on weight-loss diets or try to lose weight by eating less unless recommended by your doctor.[8]",
                "Learn to cope with stress and manage your emotions. Your teenage years are a tumultuous time, and there will be times when you feel stressed and overwhelmed. Learning healthy, productive ways to deal with your emotions will not only help you take control of your life as a teenager, it will also set you up for success as an adult.[9]\n\nWhen you find yourself getting upset, try asking yourself the following questions: \"What am I reacting to?\"; \"What about this is making me so upset?\"; \"Is this a fact or just an opinion?\"; \"Am I jumping to conclusions?\"; \"Am I putting more importance on this than it actually deserves?\"; \"Will this be important in six months?\"\nCommunicate assertively. Many people wrongly think \"assertive\" means \"aggressive.\" Being assertive means you clearly and respectfully express your wants and needs and that you listen and honor the opinions of others as well. Don't expect anyone to know what you want or need — if you need some space, simply ask for it. Say something like, \"I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed right now. I need to just go to my room and be alone for a little while.\"\nLearn to breathe deeply. Feeling overwhelmed may trigger your sympathetic nervous system, known as your fight or flight response. You can counteract this with diaphragmatic breathing, in which you breathe deeply into your belly. Place your hand on your stomach and feel your belly rise as you inhale for a count of five. Hold for a moment, then exhale for another five seconds. Do this until you begin to feel calm.\nJournaling is a great way to work through your emotions and vent. Try free-writing three pages in a notebook every day. Don't worry about spelling, grammar, making sense, or even being fair. Just let loose with whatever is going through your mind at that moment (just be sure to keep this journal private).\nFind ways to reduce your stress. Running, meditation, doing something creative, going for a bike ride, playing video games, shopping — whatever positive activity makes you feel better and less stressed, give yourself permission to enjoy it.",
                "Get plenty of sleep. Most teens do not get the recommended amount of sleep, which is at least nine to 10 hours a night. Remember, those changes your body is going through take a lot of energy, and you need to rest to recover. It’s okay for teens to sleep late on the weekends, so remind your parents that your oversleeping is not a sign of laziness, but something that’s necessary for your body.[10]\n\nTry to go to bed and wake up at regular times. Develop a sleeping routine.\nDon't stare at your phone or computer right before going to bed, and try to listen to relaxing music or read a book to create a good sleep environment.",
                "Exercise and stay in shape. Being active every day can help you gain control over your changing body, keep a positive mindset, and helps you to simply have fun. It’s recommended that teens be active for at least 60 combined minutes a day, whether through physical education or gym class, participating in a sport, or riding a bike.[11]\n\nGet active outside to help cut down on your “screen time,” or the time you spend on your phone, computer, or watching television.\nTry to make exercise a social activity, or a way of having fun with friends.",
                "Decide what your priorities and values are. You have to set priorities in terms of the tasks you accomplish, but you also have to prioritize your values in order to take control over your life. Decide what kind of person you want to be, and make good, conscious choices that’ll keep you in control of your life now and well into the future. Ask yourself questions such as:[12]\n\nWhat are positive personal qualities (like loyalty, generosity, honesty, being funny, kindness, and so on) that are most important to me?\nWhat kind of an attitude do I want to have? Do I want to be a positive person who loves life? How can I make that attitude a real thing through my daily choices?\nIf I drink, smoke, or take drugs, what will the consequences be for my health, wellbeing, and personal character?\nHow do I want to express myself through the clothes I wear, the words I say, how I treat people, the activities I do, and the quality of my work?",
                "Don’t overburden yourself. Don’t be afraid to say no. You might be faced with pressure to pack your free time with extracurricular activities to good on college applications, but understand that school and homework will give you a full eight-hour day on their own. Know yourself and know what’s too much for you to maintain your productivity and sanity.[13]\n\nFor example, you might really like to sing and love playing soccer. If you try to do choir and play soccer at the same time, you could burn yourself out or perform poorly in both. Play soccer, then when the season's over, see if you can join the choir.\nAsk yourself if taking the time for any after school activity or job will hurt your performance in the classroom. Your schoolwork should always be your top priority!",
                "Ask for help. There will be many times in your teenage years when you feel overwhelmed or need advice. Ask your parents, other trusted adults, and friends to help you. Ask them to remind you of important events and to keep track of your responsibilities.[14]\n\nDon’t put all your faith into other people, and don’t shirk your responsibilities, but never be afraid to ask for help or advice.\nKeep your parents up to date about what you have due. Say: \"Hey, I have this big test coming up in three weeks. Could you help me make sure I study for it? Maybe you could quiz me leading up to the test date?\"",
                "Become independent. Sometimes it's tough for your parents to accept that you're growing up, and they end up taking away your sense of having control over your life. Try to understand that they mainly act out of love and a need to protect you. It's important, however, to communicate to them that you are becoming responsible and independent. The key is to let them get to know you as a young adult.[15]\n\nTry spending more time out and about with your parents, like going to the mall or to stores together, out to eat, and other activities you'd normally do with friends. Show to them firsthand how you act in the outside world, that you can take care of yourself in a mature way.\nDon't tell them that a friend's parents let them do something that you're not allowed to do. You won't get anywhere with that argument, and you'll just end up insulting their parenting style. Instead, tell them in a calm, clear way how their overprotective nature makes you feel and try to compromise with them.\nTry writing a letter: sometimes we can express ourselves more clearly by writing. Jot your feelings down, let your parents give the note a read, and then have a mature discussion with them.\nWhen you do go out with friends, stay in communication with your parents. Keep them in the loop so they worry less when you're out and about, and they'll be more likely to give you more breathing room with time.",
                "Balance being a young adult with being a kid. Being a teenager involves gaining independence and freedom, and it's a strange in-between time for both you and your parents. You have to respect your parents' authority, but you can also remind them that you're growing and developing your own values and opinions. It's important for everyone to be patient and use respectful language.[16]\n\nRespect your household's rules and family's traditions. Your parents still lay down the law, and it's important to show them you care about the way they've decided to raise you.\nBe clear and calm when you're talking to your parents if you want them to respect your point of view. \"Mom, lemme go out with my friends!\" is less likely to get a positive response than saying, \"Mom, can I go to the mall with Stacy and Jill? Jill's mom would drive us there and bring us back home at eight. That will leave me enough time to finish my homework before bed.\" Negotiation, clarity, and specifics are key."

            "intro": "Pitting olives can be a difficult experience because the seed (also called \"pit\") is usually attached so firmly inside the olive. Many people try to pit olives by trying to peel away the exterior edible portion (known as the fruit), however since this causes damage to the fruit, the correct way to pit an olive is to push out the pit through the side of the olive. This can be done using basic kitchen utensils or specialized tools, depending on the amount of time you want to spend on pitting each olive.",

                "Find a large chef knife. If you don't have a chef knife you can use any other object with a hard flat surface.",

                "Continue to press down on the olive and gently pull the knife towards you. This will cause the olive to roll and help in squeezing the pit out.",
                "Maneuver the pit out of the olive with your fingers if it still hasn't popped out. Try to take out the pit in 1 piece while causing the least damage to the fruit.",
                "Purchase an olive pitter if you find pitting with a chef knife too difficult or time-consuming. This kitchen tool can pit olives using the following procedure.\n\n\nPlace the olive securely inside the small bowl at the end of the olive pitter.\nSqueeze on the handles at the other end. This punches a small hole at the end of the olive.\nContinue to squeeze the handles until the pit is forced out of the punched hole and drops to the bottom of the bowl.\nRelease the handle to drop the loose fruit into a separate bowl and discard the pit that is left behind.",
                "Consider using an olive-pitting machine if you need to pit olives quickly and frequently. These machines can be bulky and expensive and are usually only used by restaurants and food suppliers. Some machines used for olive pitting can pit over 2,000 olives per minute."

        "How to Get Rid of MRSA": {
            "intro": "MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a bacterial infection that doesn't respond well to the antibiotics usually used to fight infection. As such, it can be hard to treat and contain. The infection spreads easily, especially in crowded conditions, and can rapidly become a threat to public health. The early symptoms are sometimes confused for a harmless spider bite, so it's important to recognize MRSA immediately before it's allowed to spread.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for an abscess or boil.[1] The first symptom of MRSA is a raised, pus-filled abscess or boil that's firm to the touch and feels warm. This red blemish may have a “head” like a pimple, and can range in size from 2 to 6 centimeter (0.79 to 2.4 in) or larger. It can appear anywhere on the body, and will be extremely tender. For example, if it's on the buttocks, you likely won't be able to sit from the pain.\n\n\nA skin infection without a boil is less likely to be MRSA, but should still be checked by a doctor. More likely, you need to be treated for a Streptococcus infection or susceptible staph aureus.[2][3]",
                "Distinguish between MRSA boils and bug bites.[4] The early abscess or boil can look incredibly similar to a simple spider bite. One study showed that 30% of Americans who reported a spider bite were found to actually have MRSA.[5] Especially if you're aware of a MRSA outbreak in your area, err on the side of caution and get tested by a medical professional.\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, MRSA outbreaks were so high the public health department raised billboards showing a picture of a MRSA abscess with the text “This is not a spider bite.”\nPatients didn’t take their antibiotics, believing their doctors were wrong and had misdiagnosed spider bites.\nBe vigilant for MRSA, and always follow medical advice.",
                "Watch for fever.[6] Though not all patients get a fever, you may get one greater than 100.4°F (38°C). This can be accompanied by chills and nausea.",
                "Be alert for symptoms of sepsis. \"Systemic toxicity\" is rare, but possible if the MRSA infection is in the skin and soft tissue. While in most cases, patients can bide their time and wait for test results to confirm MRSA, sepsis is life threatening and needs immediate treatment. Symptoms include:[7]\n\nBody temperature over 101.3°F (38.5°C) or below 95°F (35°C)\nHeart rate faster than 90 beats per minute\nRapid breathing\nSwelling (edema) anywhere on the body\nAltered mental state (disorientation or unconsciousness, for example)",
                "Do not ignore symptoms. In some cases, MRSA might resolve on its own without treatment.[8] The boil may burst on its own, and your immune system may fight off the infection; however, MRSA can be more serious in people with weak immune systems.[9] If the infection worsens, bacteria could make their way into the bloodstream, causing potentially fatal septic shock. Furthermore, the infection is highly contagious, and you could get a lot of other people sick if you neglect your own treatment.",
                "See a doctor for proper diagnosis.[10] Most healthcare providers see many cases each week and should easily be able to diagnose MRSA. The most obvious diagnostic tool is the characteristic boils or abscesses. But for confirmation, the doctor will swab the site of the lesion and a lab will test it for the presence of the MRSA bacteria.\n\n\nHowever, it takes about 48 hours for the bacteria to grow, rendering immediate testing inaccurate.[11][12]\n\nNew molecular tests that can detect MRSA’s DNA in a matter of hours are becoming more widely available.[13]",
                "Use a warm compress.[14] Hopefully, you saw a doctor as soon as you suspected MRSA and caught the infection before it became dangerous. The first, early treatment for MRSA is to press a warm compress against the boil to draw the pus to the surface of the skin. This way, when the doctor cuts the abscess to drain it, she'll be more successful in removing all the pus. Antibiotics may help speed up the process. In some cases, the combination of antibiotics and warm compresses may cause spontaneous draining without actually having to cut the lesion.\n\n\nSoak a clean washcloth in water.\nMicrowave it for about two minutes, or until it's as warm as you can stand without burning your skin.\nLeave it on the lesion until the cloth cools down. Repeat the process three times per session.\nRepeat the entire warm compress session four times each day.\nWhen the boil has softened up and you can clearly see pus in the center of it, it is ready to be surgically drained by your doctor.\nSometimes though, this can make the area worse. The heat pack may be quite painful and your wound may get bigger, redder, and much worse. Discontinue the heat packs and call your doctor if that happens.",
                "Allow a doctor to drain MRSA lesions. Once you've brought the bacteria-filled pus to the surface of the lesion, the doctor will cut it open and drain the pus out safely. First, she will anesthetize the area with Lidocaine and cleanse it with Betadine. Then, using a scalpel, she will make an incision in the \"head\" of the lesion and drain it of infectious pus. She will apply pressure all around the lesion, like pushing pus out of a popped zit, to make sure all infectious material is squeezed out. The doctor will send the extracted fluid to a lab to test it for responsiveness to antibiotics.\n\n\nSometimes, there are honeycomb-like pockets of infections under the skin. These need to be broken up by using a Kelly clamp to hold the skin open while the doctor addresses the infection under the surface.\nBecause MRSA is largely resistant to antibiotics, draining is the most effective way to treat it.[15]",
                "Keep the wound clean.[16] After draining, the doctor will wash out the wound with a needle-less syringe, then pack it tightly with strips of gauze. He'll leave a \"wick\" out so you can pull the gauze out at home to clean the wound in the same manner every day. Over time (usually about two weeks), the wound will get smaller and smaller until you can't fit gauze in it anymore. Until that happens, though, you should wash out the wound every day.",
                "Take any prescribed antibiotics. Don't pressure your doctor to prescribe antibiotics against her recommendation, as MRSA does not respond well to them.[17] Over-prescribing antibiotics only helps infections become more resistant to treatment; however, there are two approaches to antibiotic treatments in general — for mild and for severe infections. Your doctor may suggest the following:[18]\n\nMild to moderate infection: take one Bactrim DS tablet every 12 hours for two weeks. If you're allergic to it, take 100mg of Doxycycline on the same schedule.\nSevere infection (IV delivery): Receive 1 gm of Vancomycin through an IV for at least an hour; 600 mg of Linezolid every 12 hours; or 600 mg of Ceftaroline for at least an hour every 12 hours.\nThe infectious disease consultant will determine the length of your IV therapy.",
                "Educate yourself on MRSA-preventing hygiene.[19] Because MRSA is so infectious, it's important that everyone in the community take be careful about hygiene and prevention, especially when there's a local outbreak.\n\n\nUse lotions and soaps from pump-bottles. Dipping your fingers into a jar of lotion or sharing a bar of soap with others can spread MRSA.\nDon't share personal items like razors, towels, or hairbrushes.\nWash all bed linens at least once a week, and wash towels and washcloths after each use.",
                "Take extra care in shared or crowded spaces.[20][21] Because MRSA spreads so easily, you must be especially aware of risks in crowded situations. These might include shared areas of a home or crowded public spaces like nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and gyms. Though many common areas are regularly disinfected, you never know when the last cleaning was or who may have been in the area before you. It's wise to place a barrier down if you're concerned.\n\n\nFor example, bring your own towel to the gym and place it between yourself and the equipment. Wash the towel immediately after use.\nMake good use of antibacterial wipes and solutions provided by the gym. Disinfect all equipment before and after use.\nIf showering in a shared space, wear flip-flops or plastic shower shoes.\nYou are at increased risk of infection if you have any cuts or have a compromised immune system (like with diabetes).",
                "Use hand sanitizer.[22]Throughout the day, you come into contact with all sorts of shared bacteria. It may be that the person who touched a doorknob before you had MRSA, and touched his nose just before opening the door. It's a good idea to use hand sanitizer throughout the day, especially when in public. Ideally, the sanitizer will contain at least 60% alcohol.\n\n\nUse it at the supermarket, when receiving change from cashiers.\nChildren should use hand sanitizer or wash their hands after playing with other children. Teachers who interact with children should follow the same standard.\nWhenever you feel you may be exposed to potential infection, use hand sanitizer just to be safe.",
                "Wash household surfaces with bleach.[23] A diluted bleach solution is effective at fighting the MRSA bug in your home. Incorporate it into your housekeeping routine during community outbreaks to decrease your risk of infection.\n\n\nAlways dilute bleach before cleaning with it, as it could discolor your surfaces.[24]\n\nUse a 1:4 ratio of bleach to water. For example, add 1 cup of bleach to 4 cups of water to clean your household surfaces.",
                "Don't rely on vitamins or natural therapies. Studies have not been able to show that vitamins and natural therapies can improve our immune systems enough to ward off MRSA. The only study that seemed promising, in which subjects were given \"mega-doses\" of vitamin B3, had to be disavowed because the dosage itself was unsafe.[25]",
                "Learn the difference between the types of MRSA. When patients come into the hospital with MRSA, it is \"community-acquired.\" \"Hospital-acquired\" MRSA is when a patient comes in the hospital for treatment of an unrelated condition, then gets MRSA while there. Hospital-acquired MRSA does not usually affect the skin and soft tissues, so you don't often see community-acquired boils and abscesses. These patients progress quickly to more serious complications.\n\n\nMRSA is a major cause of preventable death and is an epidemic in hospitals across the globe.\nThe infection spreads quickly from patient to patient via unaware hospital staff who don't follow proper infection control procedures.",
                "Protect yourself with gloves.[26] If you work in a medical setting, you absolutely must wear gloves when interacting with patients. But just as important as wearing gloves in the first place is changing gloves in between patients and washing your hands thoroughly each time you change gloves. If you don't change gloves, you may protect yourself from infection while spreading infection from one patient to the next.\n\n\nInfection control protocols vary from ward to ward, even within the same hospital. For example, infection is more prevalent in the intensive care unit (ICU), so contact and isolation precautions are usually stricter. Staff may be required to wear protective gowns and facemasks in addition to gloves.[27]",
                "Wash your hands regularly.[28] This is perhaps the most important practice for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Gloves can't be worn at all times, so hand washing is the first line of defense against spreading bacteria.",
                "Pre-screen all new patients for MRSA.[29][30] When you're dealing with patients' body fluids — whether through sneezing or through surgery — it's best to pre-screen for MRSA. Everyone in a crowded hospital setting is both a potential risk and potentially at risk. The test for MRSA is a simple nasal swab that can be analyzed within 15 hours. Screening all new admissions — even those who don’t show symptoms of MRSA — can cut down on the spread of infection. For example, one study showed that about 1/4 of preoperative patients who did not have any symptoms of MRSA were still carrying the bacteria.[31]\n\nScreening all patients may not be reasonable within your hospital’s time and budget limits. You might consider screening all surgery patients or those whose fluids staff have to come into contact with.\nIf the patient is found to have MRSA, the staff can decide on a “decolonization” strategy to prevent contamination during the surgery/procedure and transmission to other people in the health care setting.[32]",
                "Isolate patients suspected to have MRSA.[33] The last thing you want in a crowded hospital setting is for an infected patient to come into contact with uninfected patients there for other reasons. If single bed rooms are available, suspected MRSA patients should be isolated there. If that's not possible, MRSA patients should, at the very least, be quarantined into the same area, separate from the uninfected population.",
                "Make sure the hospital is well-staffed. When shifts are understaffed, overworked staff can \"burn out\" and lose focus.[34][35] A well-rested nurse is more likely to follow infection control protocols carefully, thus reducing the risk of MRSA spreading through a hospital.",
                "Be vigilant for signs of hospital-acquired MRSA. In hospital settings, patients don't usually have the early abscess symptom. Patients with central venous lines are especially vulnerable to MRSA sepsis, and those on ventilators are at risk of MRSA pneumonia.[36][37] Both are potentially lethal. MRSA can also appear as a bone infection after knee or hip replacement, or as complication from surgery or wound infection.[38] These can also lead to potentially lethal septic shock.",
                "Follow procedure when placing central venous lines.[39] Whether placing the line or caring for it, lax hygiene standards can contaminate the blood and cause infection. Blood infections can go to the heart and get lodged on the heart valves. This causes \"endocarditis,\" in which a large chunk of infectious material takes hold. This is extremely deadly.\n\n\nTreatment for endocarditis is surgical excision of the heart valve and a six week course of IV antibiotics to sterilize the blood.",
                "Take the time to maintain hygiene when handling ventilators.[40] Many patients get MRSA pneumonia while on the ventilator. When the staff is inserting or manipulating the breathing tube that goes down the trachea, bacteria can be introduced. In emergency situations, staff may not find the time to properly wash their hands, but you should always make an effort to observe this important step. If there's not time to wash your hands, at least put on a pair of sterile gloves."

                "Place another layer of decoupage glue over the top of the paper pieces, flattening all edges with the brush to ensure a smooth coating of paper. Once the glue and paper dry, you will be unable to flatten any edges, so it is important to take time to smooth it with the glue and brush now.",

You can use an antique plate, a wooden base from an arts and crafts shop, or any sturdy object that will hold your mannequin head steady when you place hats or accessories on it. Foam mannequin heads are very light and unsteady, so it is important to have a base if you intend to use it in a store.",

        "How to Make Cat Toys": {
            "intro": "Cats love to play and cat lovers can spend many hours lost in the pursuit of keeping kitty amused. Like most good things in life, you don't need to spend a fortune to ensure your cat's happiness and entertainment. Not only is a cat not judging you by how much you've managed to spend – or not spend – but your cat will be easily pleased by a range of homemade toys, plus your presence and involvement in the play. Making cat toys is child's play, so involve the kids, find the resources about the house, and don't waste any more time worrying about entertaining your cat, as he or she is sure to enjoy these homemade toys! Just see Step 1 below to get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Make pretend prey. Quite a few things can appear like prey to your playful cat, from pieces of paper, to dangling strings to even you.",
                "Scrunch up a piece of paper. Attach a piece of string to the scrunched up paper. Dangle it over kitty to make the \"prey\" come to life.",
                "Use a flashlight or laser lights to act as fast-moving prey. Cats can chase the beam for ages and they may even stalk it. It can be easy for kitty to run into things when using a flashlight for prey, so be sure to play where it's safe.",
                "Make prey from old socks with holes in them. Simply tie an old sock onto a string and wiggle it around the ground. It's a good idea to wash the socks first.",
                "Use a stick from your yard and tie a string to either end as tightly as you can. Then, add a toy or paper ball to the end. Cats love this. Try tying a toy to the end of a child-sized fishing rod for extra fun.",
                "Make a bird. What cat isn't tempted to chase a bird? Create a base for the bird by using a tennis ball and a golf ball. Glue the golf ball onto the tennis ball in a position that resembles a head on a bird's body. If you have fabric, glue this around the tennis and golf balls with non-toxic glue. For a tail, use pieces of ribbon or string and attach them to the other side of the tennis ball. Add pompom balls for eyes or draw your own with a nontoxic marker. Attach fishing wire to the top of the tennis ball and tie the other end to a stick.",
                "Make a mouse. The most typical prey of all, you must have a mouse toy for your cat! Take two large pompom balls (these sure are handy!) and glue them together. Then take a large square of grey felt and fold it in half. Cut a teardrop shape that is large enough to cover the pompoms. Once you finish cutting, you should have two teardrop shapes that are attached on one side. Place the pompom balls inside, as if you were creating a taco. Secure the open side with non-toxic glue or sew the opening closed. Draw (with non-toxic markers, of course!) two eyes and add a string or ribbon tail.\n\n\nAnother mouse possibility: Cut out two round pieces of cloth or scrap fabric. Make each the same size. Draw a face on the first piece of cloth to look like a mouse. Stuff some catnip in with the stuffing. Sew half of the mouse, then put the catnip and stuffing inside. Finish sewing up the mouse. If you want it to have a tail, break a hair tie in half and cut a little hole in the cloth. Tie the hair tie around it and sew the rest together. If you think your cat would like it better if it was attached to a string, go ahead.\nAnother mouse: Stuff an old sock with crunched paper. Sew a black button onto the end of the sock. Sew two other yellow buttons for the eyes. Find a thick piece of string for the tail. Get a flashlight and put the pretend mouse under the light. Move the light at the same time move the mouse. The kitten will try to catch it.",
                "Make a snake. Given the chance, some farm and outdoor cats do kill snakes, so it's an innate instinct to chase after a snake. To make a snake for kitty, take at least three toilet paper rolls (or if you want a bigger snake, paper towel rolls). Find a piece of string that is long enough to be fed through all the rolls and glue it inside each of the paper towel rolls to connect them. This allows the snake to bend flexibly. Cover the entire snake with green cloth and decorate as wished. Leave an opening and one end so you can place treats inside for your kitty to discover.",
                "Make a string toy. A three-or-more-feet-long piece of that fabric twisted-cord from the fabric department, with a knot tied tightly at each end, allows you to interactively play \"string\" with your feline. Or, two or more cats can use it to play together pulling and running with it. The thicker the string is, the safer the cats are with it. Slowly pulling it across the floor or bed, then pausing, then \"twitching\" it now and then will entertain most cats for ages––even the older ones who have less rip-and-tear in them often get involved!\n\n\nFor teething kittens, all you need is the tie from a bathrobe. Some bathrobes have strips of material that tie around the waist. Pull this across the floor, so it gets kitty's attention. These are perfect because your kitten can bite into it with ease and without the risk of injury.\nAlways pick up string after the cats have finished playing with it under your supervision and put it away. Cats, little people and other pets can become entangled in it if left alone with string.",
                "Try wiggling and tossing about shoe laces. Cats just love them. If your shoelace is untied, and kittens especially, should chase it around.",
                "Use light to amuse your cat. Flashlights and laser pointers are great ways to amuse your cat (and you). Turn the lights off and turn the flashlight or laser on. Cats will chase the lit-up dots or streams of light for a long time if they're in the mood.\n\n\nGiven that cats may run into other things when chasing, exercise caution when moving the flashlight to ensure you will not harm your cat in her attempts to pounce on the light.\nWhen using a laser pointer, be careful not to aim the pointer in your cat's eyes.",
                "Get creative with household items. A paper bag from the grocery store, empty sewing-thread spools, empty containers (washed thoroughly beforehand) crumpled pieces of paper, and so forth can all be put to good use as a cat toy. Empty toilet paper rolls make great toys on their own, or with items stuffed inside them.",
                "Make a self-serve treat toy. Put some dry cat food or cat treats inside an uncapped beverage plastic bottle. Your pet will hit and roll the bottle around getting his food out bit by bit. Use a bottle that has a wide cap.",
                "Throw a ping-pong ball for your cat to chase and bat around. Just be aware that this can be rather loud on tile or hardwood flooring, so if anyone's napping, try it later.",
                "Use small boxes as toy hides. Cut out doors and windows that the cat can reach. Hang toys from the top of the boxes and throw in some loosely. You cat will reach in to bat the toys inside. If you use even bigger boxes, your cat can dive in them to play and hide inside. Cats love to hide and believe they are invisible, then spring out at unsuspecting prey, so watch out!",
                "Use plastic rings. Cats love the little plastic circle rings that are part of the plastic cap on a 1 gallon (3.8 L) milk jug. They are just right to pounce on and biting the little rough ridges on the inside won't hurt kitty at all. However, always supervise this play, as accidental swallowing of such an item can be extremely harmful!",
                "Gather objects from outdoors. Items that are clean, not sharp and that roll or move easily will amuse your cat for free. In particular, cats like pine cones and these are often easy to find in local parks. If you like, attach a piece of ribbon to the pine cone for double the fun!",
                "Transform an ordinary plastic milk bottle into a treat toy.\n\n\nCut a plastic milk bottle in half. Keep the bottom part and the lid.\nPunch 2 small holes through the bottom.\nPut some thin string through both holes and both ends, leaving it to stick out inside the bottle.\nAttach the bottle top to the end of the string, making sure the lid and string can make its way out the end of the half bottle while still being attached.\nPut some treats inside.\nWatch your cat having fun trying to get the treats out.",
                "Scrunch up a ball from foil. Smooth it out and toss it to the cat. Easy, sparkly and fun.\n\n\nPlace some catnip in the center before rolling if your cat likes this herb.",
                "Use a napkin as a toy.\n\n\nTake a regular paper napkin (clean) and fold it in half lengthwise. You should get a long, narrow rectangle.\nRoll up the rectangle width-wise, so you have a short tube.\nTwist that tube by taking both ends and turning them in opposite directions. Be sure to twist it hard enough to stay.\nFor extra fun, try rubbing catnip on the napkin before rolling it up. However, don't put catnip in the napkin as it can come out during play and make a mess.",
                "Encourage your cat's fishing instincts by making a cat fishing rod. Attach a string and pompom or small toy onto a garden cane. A simple feather tied with a 3-foot (91cm) length of mint dental floss to the end of a 3-foot (91cm) long piece of wooden dowel rod makes a great toy. This provides hours of kitty motocross across the sofa, on to the bed over the stuffed chairs. Its great exercise for you and your tiger. For that matter, a long feather can make a fun, inexpensive toy on its own.",
                "Or, try this method. Sew some scrap materials together and thread some fishing wire through. Attach to a wooden pole or rod. Your cat may be scared of this object the first time. If so, turn him over on his back and let him attempt to bite your hand. Once this is done, just place the scrap material line above him instead of your hand. Hours and hours of endless fun for free.",
                "Blow bubbles for your cat. Basically, cats like anything that moves, so bubbles are a great way to have fun with your cat. Children love bubbles too, so this can be great entertainment for both cats and children at once.",
                "Play \"mouse under the blanket\". Put your hand under a blanket and move it randomly. Your cat will attack your hand! This can also work for putting your legs under a blanket at night when cozying up on the couch, so be careful!",
                "Place your cat in front of a full size mirror. This provides hours of free entertainment because cats love to interact with themselves in a mirror. Kitty might become interested or frightened with her reflection. Not all cats will react to a mirror but if your cat does, watch the fun unfold!",
                "Give baby toys a new lease of life. Some baby toys make great cat toys. Usually, toys that are safe enough for infants are safe enough for cats because there are no small parts that can come off easily. Examples of suitable baby toys include: clear plastic balls with spinners inside that twirl when the ball stops rolling, or small stuffed animals that rattle. You could also use old, light, stuffed animals or finger puppets as toys for your cats.",
                "Cut a length of string or fishing line. Make it a decent length, at least from your outstretched hand to the floor when standing.",
                "Collect or buy feathers. Attach these at different intervals along the length of string or fishing line. Use non-toxic glue; staples risk getting caught in your cat's mouth.",
                "Attach the length of feathers to a stick or a piece of wood. The length of this will depend on how long the feather length is.",
                "Play. Dangle it in front of your cat; the cat can jump at it or chase it in circles."

        "How to Use Bluetooth Technology": {
            "intro": "Bluetooth technology allows users to exchange voice and data transmissions between 2 or more electronic devices, given that all the devices are within a short distance from one another. There are numerous ways to use Bluetooth technology, such as connecting a hands-free Bluetooth earpiece with your cell phone to make phone calls while you drive, pairing a Bluetooth printer with your computer to eliminate the presence of extra cords and cables in your office, and more. See Step 1 below to learn how to get the most out of your Bluetooth-capable devices.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn what Bluetooth does. Bluetooth is a wireless connectivity tool that allows you to \"pair\" your devices so that they can interact with each other. For example, you can pair a headset with most smartphone, allowing you to talk without touching your phone. You can pair a gaming controller to a computer or console so you don't have to worry about the cord. You can send music to a Bluetooth-enabled speaker from your smartphone or laptop without having to connect them, or set up a home theater system without running speaker wire everywhere.\n\n\nBluetooth has a maximum range of about 30 feet.\nBluetooth transfer speeds top out at about 24 Mbps.",
                "Check if your devices are Bluetooth-capable. Bluetooth has been around for a long time (about 20 years), and is the market leader in wireless connectivity. Chances are that your wireless device comes with Bluetooth support. The big exception to this is desktop computers. While nearly all laptops will have Bluetooth built-in, most desktops do not include it. You will need to purchase a Bluetooth dongle if you want to connect your desktop computer to Bluetooth devices.\n\n\nMany modern cars now have Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to pair your phone while you are driving.\nVirtually every smartphone is able to pair with Bluetooth devices.\nMany newer printers are Bluetooth-capable, and can print wirelessly across the room.",
                "Learn the capabilities of your Bluetooth devices. Every Bluetooth device has either single or multiple functionalities. For example, some cell phones may only allow you to use Bluetooth for making phone calls; whereas other cell phones may also allow you to transfer files to and from other cell phones. Every Bluetooth device has slightly different functionality.\n\n\nReview the manuals or consult with the manufacturers for your electronic devices to determine the ways in which you can use their Bluetooth technology.",
                "Pair your Bluetooth devices. In order to use Bluetooth technology, you must connect your devices to one another wirelessly, also known as \"pairing\". The pairing process varies from device to device, but generally you will have one device that is \"listening\", and then the secondary device gets put into pairing mode. For example, if you are pairing a headset to a phone, your phone would be in \"listen\" mode, and the headset would be put into \"pairing\" mode. The phone would then \"discover\" the headset, and the connection would be established.\n\n\nFollow the instructions provided with your Bluetooth devices to complete the pairing process. In most cases, you will be required to perform a series of specific steps that will result in the pairing of your devices.\nWhen pairing devices, you typically will be asked for a PIN before the connection is made. If a PIN was never set, the default is usually 0000.\nPairing typically only needs to be done once. AS long as Bluetooth is enabled on the devices, future connections will happen automatically.",
                "Transfer files between devices. Some Bluetooth devices will allow you to transfer files and documents from one device to another. For example, if your friend has a bunch of good pictures on their camera, you can pair it with your phone to quickly get copies of them.[1]\n\nTransfer files between cellphones, cameras and camcorders, computers, televisions, and more.",
                "Use Bluetooth technology to talk on the phone. Bluetooth earpieces can be paired with some land-line telephones or cellphones so you can talk on the phone without having to hold its receiver. This is especially useful if you find yourself on the phone a lot for work and don't want to have to fish it out every time you get a call.",
                "Tether your phone to your computer. Tethering your device allows you to share your phone's mobile network connection with your computer. This lets you browse the internet on your computer without having to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Not all services allow tethering, so check with your mobile carrier. Sometimes extra fees are required.[2]",
                "Use Bluetooth to drive safer. Enable the Bluetooth technology built directly into your automobile or wear a Bluetooth earpiece when you drive so you can keep both hands placed on the steering wheel.

        "wikiHow to Tow a Trailer": {
            "intro": "Borrowing your friend's boat for a weekend at the lake sounds like a great idea until you realize you've got to drive it there. Whether you're hooking up a camper, a vehicle, or another variety of trailer to your car, learning the specifications and the techniques for doing so will make your job a whole lot easier. Learn to hitch your trailer properly, drive it correctly, and back it up safely. See Step 1 for more information.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure your vehicle is rated for towing the load. You probably can't tow an 8,000 pound full-size camper trailer with a Honda Civic. Depending upon the particular trailer you need to haul, you need to check to determine the weight limits in the owner's manual and determine the appropriate hitch to have installed.\n\n\nThe weight should be generally specified by the manufacturer and listed in the owner's manual. Look online if you're missing the manual, or check at an auto shop.\nYou need to find two numbers, the gross trailer weight (GTW), which is the combined weight of the trailer and the gear on it, and the maximum tongue weight for your vehicle to determine the class of hitch you'll need to tow the load.",
                "Get the appropriate class of hitch for your load installed. Generally, you'll get a hitch receiver installed that you can use for different size trailer hitches, for class 3 and up. These receivers include a removable draw-bar that you can use to install different sized hitches for different loads you might use.[1] If you get the largest receiver installed on your vehicle, you'll be ready for any sized load your vehicle can handle, classified according to the following specs:\n\n\nClass 1: 2000 pounds GTW/200 pounds tongue weight\nClass 2: 3500 pounds GTW/350 pounds tongue weight\nClass 3: 5000 pounds GTW/500 pounds tongue weight\nClass 4: 7500 pounds GTW/750 pounds tongue weight\nClass 5: 10,000 pounds GTW/1000 pounds tongue weight",
                "Get the right-sized ball for the trailer. The larger the ball, the more weight it can carry. Basically, the ball of the hitch will come in one of three sizes:\n\n\n\n1 7⁄8 inch (4.8 cm)\n2 inch (5.1 cm)\n\n2 5⁄16 inch (5.9 cm)",
                "Attach the trailer to the vehicle. Use the tongue jack to raise the trailer and align it with the ball. Make sure that the hitch lock is unlocked before lowering the trailer onto the ball and securing the tongue. Cross the safety chains to the hooks near the vehicle hitch or the vehicle frame, making sure there is enough slack in the chains but not so much that they drag on the ground.\n\n\nUsing the tongue jack, try to raise the tongue off of the ball. If you are able to do this, the ball and tongue sizes do not match, or the ball is not locked properly. In this case, replace the ball with the correct size, or lock it properly and try again.\nOnce the tongue of the trailer is on the ball, you can lock it in place by placing a bolt or padlock through the ball lock mechanism to prevent it from accidentally opening.",
                "Attach the lights with the wiring harness. Generally, these employ a simple color-coded connection that makes it easy to hook up the lights to the harness should make it easy to install the connector properly to the tow vehicle's harness.\n\n\nAfter you've hooked up the lights, do a quick brake check to make sure everything is functioning properly. It's critical to make sure that your turn signals and brakes work on the back of the trailer to ensure a safe trip (as well as no traffic tickets).[2]\n\nTo keep the connection from corroding, you might consider spraying the contacts with a small amount of dielectric grease.",
                "Check the tongue weight. You want the amount of weight resting on the hitch to be roughly 10 to 12 percent of the total weight of the trailer. You can use a regular bathroom scale to place under the beam to check.\n\n\nIf the weight out-weighs your scale (which is likely for 4000 lb. and up trailers) place the scale farther up the trailer to get a smaller measurement. If you go a third of the way up, triple the weight on the scale to get the approximate weight.\nDepending on the weight of the trailer, you might consider using an equalizing bar to even out the pressure on the hitch. These are generally long metal brackets that transfer a bit of the weight more toward your vehicle's front axle. If you're hauling at the upper end of the specs, use an equalizer.",
                "Secure your load. Depending on the load you're hauling, you might need to use a tarp to secure loose objects in boats or refuse trailers, since you're responsible for anything that flies out and causes damage.\n\n\nYou can also take this opportunity to make sure the hitch height is set correctly, your trailer's tires are inflated to the appropriate specifications, and that you haven't overloaded the trailer in such a way as to negate the careful checks you've already performed.",
                "Get familiar with the clearance of your new rig. Before you hit the road, get out your tape measure. Does the trailer make your rig considerably taller? By how much? How much length is added to the back of your car or truck? These will be important considerations any time you're trying to park somewhere you normally wouldn't give a second thought to squeezing into.\n\n\nIf it's your first time towing a trailer, it's best to practice some in a big empty parking lot before taking it out on the road. You want to be as familiar as possible with the vehicle's response time and turning radius.",
                "Accelerate and brake slowly. You must always compensate for the extra weight, especially when slowing down, and especially when driving on inclines. Play it safe and be cautious. You also need to pay especially close attention to the added length of your rig anytime you're:\n\n\nChanging lanes\nMerging\nExiting the interstate\nParking\nStopping for gas\nPulling over",
                "Prepare for the difference in fuel economy. Towing a significant amount of weight will negatively effect your fuel economy, so keep a close eye on the gauge. Making frequent pull-offs in crowded gas stations can be stressful for first-time towers, so try to anticipate your fuel needs ahead of time to avoid difficult maneuvers.",
                "Stop frequently and check the connection. Even if you checked and doubled checked your connections and everything is up to code, there's always the possibility that something in the road will jostle the trailer lose a bit. It's best to stop sometimes, especially on long or especially bumpy trips, to make sure everything's still hooked up. Seeing your trailer careen off the road isn't the time to double-check.[3]",
                "Stay calm if you take a turn too narrowly. It'll probably happen eventually that you'll mis-time a turn, or lack sufficient space to clear a turn like you figured you would. Don't panic. Make sure there isn't traffic behind you and back up slowly and as straight as possible to give yourself the clearance you need. Get a passenger to hop out and watch the trailer from a different angle to give you steering tips, and use your mirrors judiciously.",
                "Get ready. No lie: backing up a trailer is one of the most difficult driving maneuvers there is, but it's easy to master with the right technique and a bit of smarts. To get ready, roll down your windows and kick a passenger out to act as a spotter. It might take a few runs before you get it perfect, so it helps to have another set of eyes.",
                "Set yourself up for success by getting perpendicular. To get yourself oriented properly, pull more or less straight perpendicular to where you want the back end of the trailer to go, keeping the truck and the trailer straight. Pull past the spot by 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) to give yourself adequate room to back up.\n\n\nWhen you've got it lined up, turn your wheel opposite the direction of the parking spot. So, in other words, if you've pulled up perpendicular to a spot on your passenger side, enough ahead of the spot to back up, stop the car and jack the wheel to the left, or the driver's side.",
                "Learn the \"S\" turn. Basically, to get the back end of the trailer to go right, you need to make your car back up going left and then straighten it back out to avoid a jackknife. Start backing up slowly and quickly straighten the wheel back out by turning it back toward the right. Watch your back end closely and straighten it back out if your angle gets too sharp. This'll take some practice.[4]\n\nGo extremely slowly. If you're in an automatic transmission, the idling speed should be plenty fast to make you nervous. Use gas only sparingly and don't make unnecessary or fast changes.\nAvoid jackknifing. If, at any point, the angle of the truck to the trailer becomes smaller than a right angle, straight it back out and give it another go. Don't try to force it, because it won't work.",
                "Don't neglect your front end. Make friends with your side mirrors so you can keep an eye on where your front end is at all times, taking special caution to watch out for parking obstacles and bumps that might mess up your approach and be a problem when you're trying to straighten back out. Drive like a pro and use your side mirrors.\n\n\nYour rear-view will be basically useless in the task. Use the help of a spotter and your side-mirrors to back up correctly."

        "wikiHow to Know if a Bichon Frise Is the Right Dog Breed for You": {
            "intro": "Dogs of the Bichon Frise breed are loving, attentive, and energetic. It's important to determine if a Bichon Frise will be the right fit for you and your family. Before you adopt a Bichon Frise, there are a few compatibility considerations to make so that you know the breed is right for you and will make a great addition to your family.",
            "steps": [
                "Consider whether an active dog fits your lifestyle. The Bichon Frise is a small dog with a medium activity level. He will likely have a few blasts of energy throughout the day. Having another dog around the house will help him get out most of this energy, or just taking him for one or two short walks for about 15 minutes each day.[1]\n\nIf you don’t have the patience for a dog running around the house in sudden bursts of energy, or if you aren’t in the physical condition to walk a dog a few times per day, this might not be the breed for you.",
                "Be sure you can take your Bichon outdoors. The Bichon Frise is a small dog, usually only getting up to about 10-20 pounds. So, he would be a good dog for a small house or even an apartment. Still, he does have a lot of energy, so make sure he gets enough outdoor time.[2]\n\nIf you live in a big city, or if there isn’t anywhere nearby that your dog could run around, you might consider a more mellow breed of dog. Locate neighborhood parks that are dog-friendly.",
                "Think about whether your family will be compatible with a Bichon. These dogs are good with families, but there is a small concern when it comes to small children, or toddlers that are especially energetic. Smaller dogs could potentially be injured from any kind of rough play, and might nip or snap if they feel threatened.[3]\n\nFor the most part, the Bichon Frise is great with kids and families. They have a friendly, sweet temperament, and if treated nicely, will make great additions to any family.",
                "Consider that you will need to puppy-proof your house. This breed is particularly curious and adventurous, and will get into all kinds of things if you let them. You will want to make sure you put up all electrical cords, valuables, and any plants that might be poisonous to dogs.[4]\n\nThey are also prone to chew on things, to make sure you discourage this behavior early on to prevent it from getting out of hand.\nGet down on the floor and see things from their level to spot anything they might be able to get into, chew on, or destroy that might be harmful to them.",
                "Groom a Bichon Frise often. This breed needs daily brushing, starting at about a year of age, after his full coat has grown in. Get him professionally clipped and groomed every 6-8 weeks, just to prevent matting or knotting in his coat. Clip his nails as needed, and use special wipes or cream to remove the tear stains under his eyes.[5]\n\nMats and knots, if allowed to build up too much, could end up causing an infection or skin irritation. Daily brushing should help keep this to a minimum or prevent it all together.",
                "Be around a Bichon Frise as much as you can. This breed loves to be around people, and doesn’t do too well being left alone for long periods of time. If you have a long work dark or have to be out of the house most of the day or night, you might consider a different breed. These dogs love attention, and being alone for too long might lead to them becoming anxious or destructive.[6]\n\nTheir love for attention and closeness makes it easy for them to bond with their new families, and great buddies to have around.",
                "Prepare for possible ailments or diseases. Fortunately, the Bichon Frise is a mostly healthy dog, and can live long lives into their teen years. But, things like cataracts and hip dysplasia could develop later in their lives. Make sure you are prepared to deal with these health issues should they arise.[7]\n\nAs a small breed, Bichons have a tendency to have issues with dental hygiene, so getting their teeth cleaned every 2 years is important.\nIf you get your dog from a breeder and the dog is certified, there should be records that prove the dog has no genetically-passed disorders or diseases. If you adopt your dog, this will likely not be available.",
                "Take your time picking a dog. If you are adopting or picking from a litter with a breeder, remember that not all Bichons are the same. Each dog will have its own personality and energy level. Consider fostering a dog for a short trial period to make sure that particular dog is right for your family, if that option is available to you.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you are working with a breeder, visit the puppy often before it’s time for him to leave his mother. Spend time with him and see how well you and the puppy get along, how he behaves towards his littermates, and his personality.",
                "Work on “sit” and “stay.” Since these dogs are energetic and curious, they might have a bit of a tendency to rush towards the front door when it opens, or pull hard on the leash when walking. You will want to start training early on to make sure your Bichon can sit and stay on command to avoid him getting lost or put in danger.[8]\n\nFenced yards are safe for these dogs, especially if they aren’t doing too well listening to sit or stay commands. Still, you’ll want to make sure the fence is secure so the dog can’t get over or under it.[9]",
                "Prepare for house training to take a while. This breed is known for how difficult they can be to housetrain, so make sure you are prepared for some accidents along the way. Some trainers recommend crate training when working on housebreaking the dog, so consider that option.[10]\n\nSometimes being left alone can contribute to issues with housetraining. The anxiety of being alone can lead to accidents or marking.",
                "Use positive reinforcement. The best method for training a Bichon is to let him know when he’s doing something correctly and praise him for it. Relying on this rather than correcting him or scolding him when he’s done something wrong will be more effective in the long run.[11]\n\nTry using training treats. Keep these close by and give your dog one when he does something correctly, like uses the bathroom outside.",
                "Consider pursuing crate training. Since this breed is known for difficulties with potty training and separation anxiety, crate training could be beneficial to the dog’s stress levels and housebreaking. Crate training is something you will want to work on right when you bring the dog home, so that he can learn to find comfort in his crate.\n\n\nThese dogs are also known for being a bit mischievous and curious, so crate training will keep the dog away from potential hazards or chewing opportunities at night and while you are out of the house."

        "wikiHow to Go from Passive to Assertive": {
            "intro": "Increasing your assertiveness may improve your sense of self-worth and reduce the amount of stress in your life. More assertiveness on your part can also translate into an improved ability to enjoy active, healthy relationships with the people around you.[1] By learning how to communicate directly and with emotional honesty, you can avoid passive or aggressive interactions and become a more assertive, effective communicator.",
            "steps": [
                "Respect – and vocalize – your own perspective. More to the point, learn to value your perspective. If you tend to be relatively passive when interacting with others and hope to become more assertive, you need to both recognize and more frequently verbalize your needs, feelings, and opinions. The best way to do with is by reminding yourself of your specific needs and desires and actively communicating them directly and respectfully with those around you.[2]\n\nWorking to increase your assertiveness will become a self-fulfilling process as soon as you begin; even the slightest increase in your assertiveness will help you convey what you’re thinking and feeling more effectively.\nWhen you notice you have a need or desire that is not being met, perhaps in part because you haven't vocalized it, think about how you want the situation to be different.\nIt may help to write out the needs and desires you intend to better vocalize, or talk about them with a close friend. Practice identifying and vocalizing your needs and desires so you feel more confident about asserting yourself when it is necessary to do so.",
                "Start increasing your assertiveness in one particular domain. It will be easier to be more assertive within one area of your life first. This does not mean you should be more assertive with those who are younger than you or in a less experienced position in your work environment. Instead, look to be more assertive with those who know you well and will likely respect your more active participation in social interactions.[3]\n\nBe specific. Choose to become more assertive in one specific place or during your interactions with one particular person. For example, you could decide to be more assertive with a friend who always tries to plan things for you without asking you first.\nBe consistent. Make sure to practice being more assertive whenever you’re in that place or with that person. If your friend often calls you up on Friday afternoon to tell you what the two of you will be doing, then anticipate the call each week and practice what you will say.\nAs you realize you’re successfully becoming more assertive, expand the positive changes you’ve made in one area of your life into another social sphere. After being more assertive with this friend, you might start being more assertive at work, with family members, or with your significant other.",
                "Convey confidence with your non-verbal behavior. The classic example here is maintaining eye contact. Make sure you’re making frequent, direct eye contact with the people with whom you interact, especially when speaking directly to someone. Sit or stand upright, with your body turned towards whomever has your attention.[4]\n\nSmile when you’re happy and frown when you’re angry. This alone will go a long way in helping you externalize emotional honesty.\nMake sure your body language is relaxed. Not only does this convey confidence, it will actually give you more confidence too. In particular, make sure you’re not clenching your jaw.\nPractice in the mirror. It may feel silly at first, but looking at how you sit or stand in the mirror will help you recognize aspects of your posture that may be read as passivity by other people.",
                "Prepare for the fact that you may meet with some resistance. As you attempt to increase your assertiveness, understand that people’s reactions will not always happen as you expect. In fact, if people have become accustomed to you interacting with them passively, they may initially be startled or even respond negatively the first few times you express a healthy, respectful assertiveness.[5]\n\nAccept that you will likely face some discomfort while increasing your assertiveness. However, this is a good thing! It means that you are growing and learning.\nRemind yourself that it is within your rights to assert your needs and feelings – and that doing so will lead to better relationships in the long term.\nIf you encounter any resistance or negativity, remind yourself that you are in control of your own reactions and continue to behave respectfully and assertively.\nSay something like “I’ve decided not to allow others to take advantage of me, and I won’t allow us to attack one another for seeing things differently.”",
                "Prepare for the benefits of more assertive behavior too. Aside from all the benefits of reducing stress, being more assertive will help prevent the resentment that can sometimes grow within the context of passivity. Aside from offering a more healthy way to process your anger, increased assertiveness will literally help you get more of what you want out of life. Remind yourself that you deserve it.[6]\n\nThink about how your life will be better when you're able to be more assertive in certain situations, and visualize the relief from tension and other rewards your assertiveness will likely bring.\nWrite down the benefits of being more assertive that you're most looking forward to. Carry this list with you as motivation to continue respectfully vocalizing your needs and desires.",
                "Practice saying no. It is especially important to recognize and embrace your right to simply say “no.” Especially if you usually find it challenging to turn people down, literally practice doing so in front of a mirror. Look yourself in the eye and say, \"No, I’m not able to do that right now.\"[7]\n\nWhen actually turning a request or demand down, be direct. Include an explanation, but keep it brief, and emphasize that you are unwilling or unable to do what has been asked of you.\nRehearse what you intend to say. If there are recurring things you’re asked to and comply only because you feel pressured to do so, prepare yourself to stand up for yourself by practicing exactly what you’ll say next time.",
                "Make sure your tone conveys assertiveness. Aside from what you’re actually saying, how you say it is also an extremely important aspect of healthy, constructive communication. Monitor your use of your voice to ensure you speak firmly, but in a relaxed tone and at a steady, confident pace. Limit your hesitations. Try to speak with depth and warmth – this will help reflect the emotions you’re feeling.[8]\n\nEmphasize sincerity and clarity in the way you speak.\nMonitor the volume of your voice too. Speaking too quietly – or too loudly – will lead people to take you less seriously.",
                "Listen actively and with genuine attention. Whenever anything is unclear, ask questions! Part of listening is understanding exactly where people are coming from. If you’re not understanding someone, ask for clarity and convey your willingness to listen and collaborate with the language you use.[9]\n\nAsk things like “What are your thoughts on this?”, “Does this work with how you’re feeling?”, or “How do you think we can approach this differently?”\nTake care to maintain respectful and active nonverbal listening behavior. Focus on the person, maintain eye contact, and set aside your personal perspective to allow yourself to fully comprehend theirs.\nRepeat others’ key points back to them when they’re finished speaking with statements like “It sounds like you feel like ___________.”",
                "Validate the other person’s perspective. Do this early in a conversation to introduce the positivity you want to maintain. You don’t have to agree with the other person, but you have to acknowledge what they’re feeling.[10]\n\nBe explicit. Say something along the lines of “I understand you see this issue differently.” Or, “I understand why you need help with that.”\nIf you cannot help the person, be ready to clearly state why. Be brief, but also sincere. For example, if a friend wants you to help him or her move over the weekend and you already have plans, then you might say something like, “I would help if I could, but I can’t. I already have plans with my family.”",
                "Follow with a direct statement of your own needs and desires. Particularly when there are multiple perspectives to consider, or when a decision is yours to make, it is important to be clear about why you see something differently. If there is a conflict between perspectives, the more clearly you convey the specific difference in your perspective, the better chance an issue can be worked through cooperatively.[11]\n\nFor example, if you have just explained to a friend that you can’t help him move because you have plans with your family, then you might try following it with something like, “Spending time with my family is important to me.”\nBe assertive when distinguishing between fact and opinion. While responses to opinions should mostly start with “I feel” or “I think”, responses to facts should be more direct and start with clauses like “I’ve had different experiences” or “I have come to understand that differently.”",
                "Propose an active step to resolve a conflict. While discussion is healthy, and absolutely necessary when there are multiple perspectives to consider, a proposal on how to move forward is one of the most constructive and assertive contributions you can make in a conversation, particularly in a group.[12]\n\nAvoid the words “should” or “ought” when making suggestions, opting instead for “What about…” or “Would it work if….”\nMaintain a collaborative approach by shooting for an action that has the best chance of pleasing all relevant parties.",
                "String together an empathetic, direct, and active response. If you have already made a decision, particularly when declining something that has been asked of you, convey your understanding of the situation and corresponding decision all in one statement. For instance:[13]\n\n“I absolutely agree that it would be great to _______________. However, I can’t [participate in it / join you / allow that to happen] because _________________. How about figuring out [a different time that will work for everyone / someone else who can help / an alternative].”",
                "Deal with minor conflicts with direct statements as well. For instance: “I’m glad that we’re able to share [each other’s items / the kitchen / the bathroom]. However, it frustrates me when [items are broken / dishes are left in the sink / the bathroom is a mess]. Let’s figure out a system to deal with [the rules about borrowing each other’s possessions / using the kitchen / sharing the bathroom].”[14]",
                "Stick to the point with “I” statements. Whenever you know what you need, what you want, or how you’re feeling, make sure this is conveyed simply and directly. Especially when making a request, state what you’re asking in one or two short, clear sentences.[15] Start the statement with a simple declarative, such as “I want”, “I don’t like”, or “I feel.”\n\n\nConvey excitement or enthusiasm with “I” statements in particular, by saying things like, “I would very much enjoy it if_______.”",
                "Avoid using aggressive language. As you become more assertive, it is extremely important to avoid using language that conveys aggression. In particular, avoid starting statement with “you”, as this will put the other person on the defensive and will only complicate or unnecessarily prolong conversations.[16] For instance, opt for “I disagree” instead of “you’re wrong” or “I feel irritated when you interrupt” instead of “you’re always interrupting me!”",
                "Allow yourself to feel anger. Anger and other emotions have a complex relationship with your ability to communicate. If you tend to be passive, you’re likely not at fault for overreacting to anger with aggressive behavior. However, you may need to realize that it is healthy to express the fact that something angers you.[17]\n\nAnger is normal and natural.\nLearn to recognize your anger by listening to your body for clues. A rise in your heart rate and blood pressure, the feeling of blood rushing to your face or other parts of your body, and a wave of warmth may all indicate that anger is rising beneath the surface of your skin.\nAvoid hiding your anger, as this may lead to stress, resentment towards those that anger you, feelings of victimization, and the growing – though suppressed – desire to act out.",
                "Express your anger with emotionally honest communication. Recognize that passive-aggressiveness is just as detrimental to your relationships as blatant aggression. Own and admit your anger, and respond to it with maturity by voicing it directly while being calm and respectful.[18] The easiest and clearest way to do so is to take a deep breath and simply tell someone that their behavior has irritated you.\n\n\nTake care not to attack whomever has angered you. Keep your statement simple and straightforward by saying something along the lines of “I felt aggravated when ___________ and I need you to know that I’m not comfortable with [behavior / statements] like that.”",
                "Don’t allow others to disregard your wants and needs. Though there is nothing wrong with being shy or easy going, you should always participate in a conversation or interaction when you have a relevant perspective. If you constantly just “go with the flow” for the sake of avoiding conflict, people may start to disregard your thoughts and feelings.[19]\n\nIf, in fact, you actually don’t want to go for pizza yet again, and would rather grab some sushi – say it!\nCertainly, some stuff simply isn’t important, so don’t feel like you always have to be a part of every conversation. The point is: when you do have feelings on a matter, voice them.",
                "Say yes only when you really mean yes. Often, passive people will agree to things that ultimately make them more stressed or simply diminish the quality of their lives unnecessarily. If and when you want to say no, you have to accept and practice the necessity of doing so! [20]",
                "Let yourself change your mind about things. Recognize that changing your mind about something and acting on your decision to do so is actually an assertive, healthy behavior.[21] Understand that your mindset, and your understanding of a situation will frequently change, and that increased assertiveness will make you more flexible about changing the decisions you’ve made and when making new ones.\n\n\nAs you become more assertive, you should be taking a more active role in the conversations that concern you.\nTake pride in making independent contributions and decisions.",
                "Get help becoming more assertive. Be patient and understanding with yourself. It’s tough to start voicing your perspective more frequently, especially when you’re used to staying quiet.[22] If you’re struggling with increasing your assertiveness or become increasingly stressed about how to go about doing so – or if you’re just looking for support while doing so – see a mental health professional.\n\n\nThe act of getting help is itself an assertive step, as it is an active demonstration of your willingness to improve your ability to voice your perspective and pave yourself a road to a healthier, happier life."

        "How to Remove an Ingrown Hair": {
            "intro": "An ingrown hair is a hair that curls back on itself. While ingrown hairs more commonly occur in individuals with curly hair, almost everybody will develop one at some point in their life. If you shave regularly, you may have to deal with ingrown hairs more commonly than the average person. Got one now? Follow these instructions to treat the issue and keep it from coming back.",
            "steps": [
                "Use a sterile needle, tweezers or a rotable medical device for ingrown hairs to gently tease the hair out of the skin. Use the warm compress first––this should bring the hair to the surface––don't dig for the hair if you can't easily get at it. Don't pluck the hair out completely if you can avoid doing so; just make sure that the ingrown end is out of the skin. It may take a little time to coax the hair out, so persevere and do not cut the skin.\n\n\nSometimes you'll see a loop of the hair close to the surface of the skin. This means that the tip of the hair has begun growing down into the skin. If you get a needle in the loop and tug lightly, the end will often come loose.\nIf you choose to use tweezers, remember that tweezers can be bought either pointy or flat-tipped. A pointy-tipped pair may cause less damage to the skin around the hair if used carefully. Another choice might be to use a rotable medical device for ingrown hairs which does not damage the follicle or the surrounding skin.",
                "Wash the area around the (formerly) ingrown hair with warm water and moisturizing soap. Apply an antiseptic to provide extra protection against infection. Avoid wearing tight clothing on that area, and exfoliate regularly to prevent new ingrown hairs. You may wish to apply a daily topical solution to prevent any further ingrown hairs from developing.\n\n\nSometimes, the ingrown hairs may not budge at all because they may be placed in very deep. If these methods do not work, talk to your doctor or dermatologist to get a prescription medication.",
                "Apply a warm, moist compress to the area for a few minutes. This will soften the skin.\n\n\nJust wet a washcloth with hot water, wring it out, and press it against the ingrown hair. When the washcloth cools down, run it under hot water again.\nIf you can see the ingrown hair embedded in the skin, this treatment will soften the hair and bring it closer to the surface. If you can't initially see the hair, leave the warm compress on until it rises to the skin's surface.\nIf you apply the compress for ten minutes, and you still can't see any sign of hair, you're not going to be able to remove it yourself, or it might be something else altogether. And while you're fretting over your skin, this might be a good time to Check for Skin Cancer.",
                "Remove the membrane from inside an eggshell.",
                "Cover the problem area with the membrane.",

                "Pull it off once dry. The ingrown hair should come out with it.",
                "Apply a dab of acne medication. Ingrown hairs are pretty similar to pimples, especially when the ingrown hair is accompanied by pus. Apply benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid several times a day for a few days. This, combined with daily exfoliation, is often enough to remove the ingrown hair, since swelling will be reduced, giving the hair more room to grow out (rather than in). If you don't have acne medication on hand, you can try using the aspirin method or adding a dab of toothpaste.",
                "Warm up a small amount of milk. Don't make it too hot.",
                "Dip a piece of bread into the milk.",

                "Leave the dipped bread on. Remove when it feels cool; this will be about 2 minutes.",
                "Repeat the dip and hold during about 10 minutes.",
                "Check for an opening of the pore. Use a needle to pull up the loop of hair and free it.\n\n\nIf you cannot see the opening, repeat the dip and hold. If it fails to open, see your health professional for advice.",
                "Exfoliate the area. Twice a day, scrub the ingrown hair gently. This will help to remove any dead skin cells, dirt, and oils that might be trapping the ingrown hair. It may also physically nudge the tip of the hair out of your skin. Try to hit the ingrown hair from a variety of directions. Use an exfoliating glove or ingrown hair brush, and try one of the following exfoliating techniques:\n\n\nExfoliate your legs with salt\nExfoliate your skin with olive oil and sugar",
                "Be gentle. You'll need to exfoliate enough to achieve this effect, but not so much that the area surrounding the ingrown hair starts to bleed.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, exfoliate more gently but for a longer period.\nNote! It's very difficult to remove an ingrown hair from under a scab. In this case, it might be best to use a different method, or consult your doctor."

        "How to Hem Jeans": {
            "intro": "Finding jeans with just the right leg length straight off the rack is nearly impossible. If you've found jeans that fit but are too long, then you can take them to a tailor or sew a new hem yourself. You can either keep the original hem, or you can create a new hem. Keep in mind that working with denim can be tricky, so there are a few strategies you may want to use to ensure a successful project.",
            "steps": [
                "Decide where to hem. Try on your jeans and decide where you would like to hem them. Generally, jeans should fall about an inch above the floor. This will prevent you from tripping and also avoid making your jeans look like they are a size too small. Feel free to alter the length to meet your personal preferences though.",
                "Fold up the bottom. Create a cuff where you want the jeans to be hemmed. Crease the fold so it lies flat and double-check that you've folded it up by the correct amount. Once you've done this on one side, measure just below the preexisting hem and use that measurement to create an equal fold on the other leg.",
                "Pin the hem in place. Place straight pins around the circumference of the pant leg to hold it in place. Check to be sure the seams line up on each pant leg as well as that they are even with each other.[1]",
                "Sew the hem. Stitch around the circumference of the pant leg just below the stitching for the existing hem. You can use a sewing machine or do this by hand. To be clear, you will be sewing the cuff to the pant leg and later will fold it inside the leg. This will allow you to take out the hem later if you grow taller or want the pants longer at a later point in time.",
                "Unfold the hem. Tuck the excess fabric of the folded cuff up into the leg of the jeans, folding the original hem down so its outer side shows once again. This should leave you a small loop of fabric along the bottom edge of the jeans inside the leg. Try on the jeans to make sure they are at the correct length.\n\nIf you don’t expect to want to lengthen the jeans at any point, then you can also cut the excess fabric. Cut the excess fabric about 1 inch away from the new seam you have created.[2]",
                "Iron the jeans. Use an iron to flatten out the hem you've created along the bottom edge. This will smooth out the loop of fabric tucked into the leg, and leave your jeans looking the perfect length with no tell-tale hemming signs.[3]",
                "Mark your jeans where you’d like the new hem to be. The best way to do this is to put your jeans on (or have the person who will be wearing the jeans put them on) and fold the cuff under until the jeans are the length you’d like them to be. Then, use a piece of chalk to mark the spot where the new hem should end.[4]",
                "Measure and mark two more lines. Measure ½” from the hem line and draw a line above it that is running parallel to the first one. Then, measure and mark another ½” below the original line and draw the line so it is parallel to the original one as well.[5]\n\nNow you should have three lines total. These lines will serve as a guide for you to sew the new hem.",
                "Cut along the bottom line. Cut off the bottom of the jeans and the old hem. To do this, cut in a straight line along the bottom line that you made. Discard the material that you cut off.[6]",
                "Fold the new hem under. Next, fold along the center chalk line to create the new hem. You may also want to pin along the new hem to hold it in place while you sew. Check to make sure that the hem is even all the way around before you sew.[7]",
                "Sew the new hem. Using some gold denim thread, or the thread color of your choice, sew around the area you pinned to hold the new hem in place. Use a straight stitch and try to keep it as even as possible.[8]\n\nRemove the pins as you go.\nAfter you sew around both hems, your jeans will be ready to wear!",
                "Wash the jeans first if they are new. Denim will shrink a bit the first time you wash it, so it is a good idea to do a pre-wash before hemming your jeans. This will help to ensure that you do not make the hem too short.[9]\n\nMake sure to follow the instructions on the label for washing your jeans.",
                "Use a new needle. It is important to change your sewing machine needle after every four hours of sewing or after finishing a major project to ensure that it is sharp enough to do the job. If you have not changed the needle in a while, then put in a new needle before you begin sewing the new hem.[10]",
                "Go slow. Denim and other bulky fabrics can be a bit harder to sew. They may get caught more easily, or not move as efficiently through the presser foot. To ensure that your stitches are even and straight, sew slowly.[11]\n\nStart by applying very light pressure on the pedal to get the stitches started and then only increase the speed slightly if the fabric seems to be moving along well.\nIf the fabric gets stuck, then you can always use the hand wheel to help move it along."

        "wikiHow to Get Rid of Period Cramps when Medicine Does Not Work": {
            "intro": "Menstrual cramps affect many people during their monthly period. Every cycle, your body prepares for the fertilization of an embryo, building up the best environment for it. Once your body realizes you aren't getting pregnant any time soon, the uterus starts to contract in order to expel its lining which results in throbbing and cramping pains. There are many ways to help alleviate menstrual cramps naturally and without medicine.",
            "steps": [
                "Do some exercise. For many, the thought of exercising while menstruating is laughable. However, being a little active helps to easy belly pain. It releases beta-endorphins that act as our body's natural painkiller.[1] These painkillers burn the chemicals that cause uterine contractions much faster. Try anything that gets your heart pumping, like:\n\n\nBrisk walking.\nJogging.\nSwimming.\nBiking.\nSkating.\nRegularly exercising before, during, and after your period will benefit your entire body, especially if you're prone to painful menstrual cramps.",
                "Do yoga. Yoga helps to stretch out cramping muscles, as well as activates your body's natural painkilling endorphins. It is especially helpful in relieving back pain, sore legs, and abdominal pain due to your period. Yoga is also a great breathing exercise that helps to lessen stress levels which affects menstrual cramps, making you more relaxed. Try these poses:[2][3]\n\n\nHead-To-Knee Forward Bend: Sit with your legs extended in front of you, with your toes facing upwards. Bend the right knee so that the sole of your foot presses against your inner thigh. If that is too far for your to bend, rest your foot on your inner calf instead. Exhale as you slowly bend forward while reaching from your groin to your extended left foot. Keep your gaze locked at your extended foot. Plant your bottom or \"sit bones\" firmly into the ground. Take deep breaths, in and out, and stay in this pose for 1 to 3 minutes. Do the same for your other leg.\n\nCamel Pose: Kneel on the floor with your knees hip-width apart. Turn your thighs inward only slightly, while keeping your shins and the top of your feet planted on the ground. Let your hands hang behind your hips with your fingers to the ground. Inhale as you lift up your chest while pressing your shoulders down to your hips. Exhale as you push your hips forward and arch your back. Your fingers should graze the top of your calves or the heels of your feet. Use your hands to steady yourself and drop your head back. Taking deep breaths, in and out, do this post for 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nForward Bend: Stand with your feet together and arms at your side. Plant your feet into the ground and inhale while slowly reaching your arms towards the ceiling. Exhale while you bring your arms out and down as your start to bend forward until your hands touch the floor. Flatten your hand on the floor. If you can't reach the floor, bend your knees. Keep this pose for 1 minute while you breathe steadily in and out.",
                "Have an orgasm. In the same way that exercising works, having an orgasm releases endorphins to help with pain. The extra heat and increased blood flow also aids in relieving cramps. Orgasms also induce sleep, which is also a vital part of pain reduction.[4]\n\nYou don't have to have sex to achieve orgasm. Women who masturbate often report that it helps them relieve menstrual pains and symptoms.[5]\n\nIt is completely possible to have sex while on your period. Be sure your partner consents to having sex while you're menstruating. It can often get messy, but if you do it in a safe and healthy way, you can enjoy the benefits of sex even on your period.",
                "Take a hot bath or shower. Warmth or heat helps to relax the contracting muscles of your uterus and other sore places. Athletes usually take hot showers right after they exercise to help soothe their muscles and prevent soreness the days following.\n\n\nFor some people, being in water helps to slow the flow of their periods, making it possible to stay in the tub, blood-free. In a tub, the water acts to push against your vagina and slow down the flow. However, if you sit long enough, you'll most likely see blood flow out.",
                "Apply a heating pad or bottle to your abdomen. Similar to a hot bath and shower, heat helps to relax muscles and encourage increased blood flow to reduce pain. Use a hot water bottle or heating pad on your stomach for about 15 minutes.\n\n\nYou can also try using heating patches if you're on the move. Follow the instructions of the heating patches carefully to prevent burns or putting it on irritated or damaged skin.",
                "Drink hot beverages. Hot water and tea is often recommended to people with cramps to help relieve abdominal pain. The warmth from your hot drink helps to loose muscles and increase blood flow in your body.\n\n\nAvoid drinks with a high sugar content which may increase bloating and make your cramps worse.",
                "Make yogurt smoothies. With some cramps, constipation follows. The calcium in yogurt helps relieve pain while the probiotics help regulate your digestive tract. However, avoid yogurts with a high sugar content which can cause excess bloating and upset your stomach even more.\n\n\nCalcium can also be found in other dairy products like milk and cheese, and in vegetables like mustard greens, collard greens, and turnip greens.[6]\n\nHowever, dairy should be consumed sparingly, as it contains an acid that can cause cramps.",
                "Drink different types of teas. Different kinds of teas can help with different symptoms of menstruation. The herbs inside the tea work to help relieve pain, relax muscles, and even control the flow of bleeding. Try drinking:\n\n\n\nGinger tea. It is an antispasmodic herb that helps relieve pain and reduce bloating. It also helps oxygenate your body which works to relieve stress. If you don't have powdered ginger, grate a tablespoon of real ginger, mix it with hot water, and let it steep for 5 minutes before drinking.\n\nChamomile tea. This tea helps reduce inflammation and has glycine which reduces muscle spasms and relaxes the nerves.[7]\n\n\nRed raspberry tea. This herb is often hailed as a go-to tea to help with premenstrual symptoms. The tea contains fragarine that assists in helping tighten and tone the muscles in your pelvic region. It also contains tannins that treats cramps, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. However, in order to benefit from this tea, it should be taken regularly and best ingested before your period.[8]",
                "Stay away from caffeine. Coffee can irritate the intestines and cause your blood vessels to restrict blood flow to your body. Try to drink decaffeinated coffees and teas.\n\n\nSome teas do have caffeine in them so if you're particularly sensitive to caffeine, make sure to find out if your tea of choice has caffeine or offers a decaffeinated version of it.",
                "Don't drink alcohol. Alcohol stores up water in your body which can cause excess bloating and aggravate menstrual cramps. It can also lower magnesium levels in your body which is used to regulate muscle function and blood sugar levels.\n\n\nLimit yourself to one glass of wine or bottle of beer if you have to drink alcohol."

        "wikiHow to Install Linoleum Flooring": {
            "intro": "Linoleum, a term that originally referred to a natural material made from linseed oil, pine rosins, and other organic materials, is now used as a general term for both the original material and for a variety of modern substitutes made from vinyl plastic. These flooring materials, widely used for their affordability, water-tightness, and durability, are generally installed by securing them over an existing floor or subfloor with strong adhesive. Though linoleum is fairly easy to install compared to more expensive alternatives, it can present unique challenges for the inexperienced home-improver, so start with Step 1 below to learn how to effectively install your own linoleum floor.",
            "steps": [
                "Acclimate your linoleum to the room. Linoleum and its synthetic alternatives are soft, pliable, and flexible when compared to most other flooring materials. In fact, they're so flexible that they will actually shrink and expand ever-so-slightly with changes in temperature.[1] Though these changes are imperceptible to the naked eye, they can cause minor issues when it comes to installing and maintaining your floor. Because of this, you'll want to give your linoleum a chance to reach its \"resting\" size by storing it in the room you intend to use it in for about 24 hours prior to installing it.",
                "Remove any furniture, appliances, and doors. Before beginning the process of laying down your linoleum flooring, you'll want to completely clear your work area from any possible obstructions. For most rooms, this will mean removing any furniture or floor decorations (e.g. rugs, etc.), along with any appliances that are connected to the floor, like toilets or pedestal-style sinks. Finally, you will probably want to remove any doors from their hinges, especially if they open inward, to ensure that you're able to comfortably work all the way to the edge of the room.\n\n\nWhen it comes to preparing your work area, be conservative. Spending a little extra time removing items that may not be completely necessary to remove is almost always a better use of time than halting your work later on to, for instance, uninstall a toilet that's in your way.",
                "Detach any baseboards. Next, remove any baseboards — the small wooden \"trim\" pieces at the bottom of a wall — that run along the edges of your floor. Usually, this can be accomplished by carefully prying with a pry bar, flat head screwdriver, or sturdy putty knife. To prevent damage to your wall, try inserting a small block of wood behind your prying tool as you work the baseboard away from the wall. This keeps your tool from scratching against the wall and provides additional leverage.[2]\n\nWhile you're working on your baseboards, take the opportunity to also remove any outlet covers that could be damaged by your linoleum flooring installation project.",
                "Remove baseboard nails. After you remove your baseboards, quickly examine your bottoms of your walls near the floor to look for any leftover nails sticking out of the wall. Carefully pull these nails out of the wall with a pair of pliers, the \"claw\" end of a hammer, or a similar prying tool. If left in, these nails can present problems when attempting to lay your linoleum flat against the wall.",
                "Patch up pre-existing flooring material. Linoleum must be laid over floor that's as close to perfectly smooth and even as possible. If it isn't, the underlying imperfections will eventually be reflected in the linoleum itself, resulting in unsightly bumps, ridges, soft spots, and so on. If you plan to lay your linoleum over the existing floor, check it to make sure that it is level and free of imperfections. If you plan to lay it over the subfloor, remove your existing flooring and check whether the subfloor is in good condition. If your floor or subfloor isn't completely even and level, you may want to try fixing minor issues with the tips below:[3]\n\nConcrete floors: Level high spots with a grinder or masonry chisel. Fill in small holes or cracks with additional concrete.\nWood floors: Use an embossing leveler to fix minor dents and indentations. For more serious issues, use plywood underlayment (see below).\nExisting linoleum floors: Repair worn sections of floor or indentations with an embossing leveler (apply with a straightedge trowel). If any sections are damaged or loose, remove the linoleum and work off of the subfloor.",
                "Alternatively, use a plywood underlay. Some floors and subfloors just aren't suitable for supporting linoleum flooring — either they're too worn or damaged to easily repair or you'd like to keep the floor material for use in other projects. In these cases, it's usually best to use a plywood underlayment to support the linoleum. Cut 1/4 inch (0.63 centimeter) underlayment-grade plywood to fit the floor area you plan to cover with linoleum, then lay this over the existing floor or subfloor. This provides a smooth, even surface for the linoleum to rest on, bypassing the problems of using a damaged or worn floor entirely.\n\n\nFor tight seams for your plywood pieces, use a pneumatic stapler about every 8 inches (20.3 cm) along edges.\nDon't forget that using an underlayment will raise the level of the floor slightly, which may require you to shave off a small amount of material from the bottoms of any doors in the room.",
                "Determine the amount of linoleum you'll need. Now that your floor is ready for linoleum to be installed, it's time to measure it so that you'll know precisely how much linoleum to use and exactly how to cut it. You have several options for measuring your floor — just a few are listed below. Regardless of which method you use, it's important to make your measurements as accurate as possible so that your linoleum will fit precisely against your walls and appliances.\n\n\nOne option for measuring your floor is to lay down a large sheet (or sheets) of a heavy paper like butcher paper across the area of floor you intend to cover with linoleum. Use a pencil to precisely trace the edges of the floor area. Cut the shape of your floor area from your paper, then use this as an outline when you cut out your linoleum.\nAnother option is to use a tape measure to obtain measurements for all of the sides of your flooring area. Sketch these results on a piece of paper and use your measurements to cut your piece of linoleum. This method is especially handy for square or rectangular sections of floor — all you need to do is measure two perpendicular sides and you'll know exactly how much to cut.",
                "Mark your cutting lines on your linoleum. Once you have a paper outline of your floor area or precise measurements and a rough sketch, you're ready to mark your linoleum material with its final shape. Use a washable marker to trace your paper outline or use a straightedge and tape measure to draw lines according to the floor measurements you took. Linoleum is usually sold in 6 or 12 foot (1.8 - 3.6 meter) wide rolls, so it should be possible to mark and cut linoleum flooring for most small spaces and rooms (e.g., bathrooms, hallways, etc.) in one seamless piece. For larger projects, it's OK to use two or more pieces.\n\n\nIt's almost always a good idea to mark your linoleum floor pieces about an inch or two wider than they need to be. While it's fairly easy to trim the edges of the linoleum to make it fit your floor space, there's no way to make a piece of linoleum that's too small bigger, so be conservative when cutting your linoleum.",
                "Cut your linoleum. Once you know the exact dimensions of the floor area you intend to cover, you can begin cutting your linoleum. Note that, for the most accurate fit, it's best to use linoleum that's been allowed to acclimate to the room for about a day (see above). Use the measurement or outline you took to cut your linoleum in as few separate pieces as possible.\n\n\nTo cut your linoleum, use a sharp utility knife or a hooked linoleum knife and cut along your pre-marked lines. Use a straightedge to ensure an accurate cut. If you have some handy, put an extra layer of plywood underneath your linoleum as you cut it to avoid gouging your floor.",
                "Lay your vinyl down and trim to fit. Carefully move the cut linoleum piece(s) into position and lay it down. Work the linoleum around any corners and obstructions, taking care not to crease it. If you marked and cut your linoleum so that you have an extra inch or two on every side, the extra material will lay up against the walls. Use your linoleum-cutting tool to carefully trim the edges of your linoleum so that it lays flat on the floor and is flush against the edges of the flooring area. Below are a few tips for trimming your linoleum to fit snugly:\n\n\nStraight walls: Use a straightedge or straight piece of wood (like a 2x4) to crease the linoleum against the corner where the wall meets the floor. Cut along the crease.\nInside corners: Use V-shaped cuts to shave excess material off of the linoleum where it meets the inside corner. Cautiously remove thin strips of material until the linoleum just lays flat against the floor.\nOutside corners: Make a vertical cut inward from the corner at a 45o angle. Shave material off from both sides of the corner until the linoleum sits flat against the floor.",
                "Apply adhesive. Now, peel back half of your floor. Use a notched trowel to spread adhesive on the underside of the linoleum. Follow the linoleum's recommended directions for use — some linoleum is meant to have adhesive applied evenly across the entire underside, while other types of linoleum are meant to have adhesive applied only along the edges. Allow the adhesive to sit briefly (most adhesives used for this purpose recommend doing so to achieve the best hold), then roll it back down and carefully press it into its place on the floor. Repeat for the other half of the floor.\n\n\nLinoleum/flooring adhesive is almost always available at major hardware stores (often under the all-purpose name \"flooring adhesive\"). Always defer to the usage instructions included with the products you buy, including your adhesive. — if they vary from those presented in this article, err on the safe side by following them.\nFor linoleum requiring adhesive all over its underside (rather than around the perimeter), leave a few inches along the edges without adhesive. Linoleum can shrink and expand slightly when exposed to glue, so wait to apply adhesive to the edges until this settling has occurred.",
                "Secure the linoleum with a roller. Use a heavy roller (a 100 pound model should work well) to remove air bubbles from the linoleum and securely adhere it to the floor or subfloor. Work from the middle of the floor to the edges, taking care to carefully roll over the entire floor. If this forces excess adhesive out from under the edges of the linoleum, use a solvent to dissolve it and remove it with a wet rag according to the manufacturer's directions.",
                "Finish the linoleum sealant. To give your new linoleum floor a protective, glossy sheen that can add longevity, finish it with an approved linoleum sealant. Use a brush or roller to apply a thin, even coat over the entire piece of linoleum, taking care not to leave any spots bare. Work from the farthest corners of the floor inward to ensure that you don't have to step on any wet sealant.\n\n\nPay extra attention to any seams in the linoleum — spaces where two pieces of linoleum rest against each other. If not sealed properly, these seams can become natural locations for peeling and water damage.",
                "Stay off of the floor for about 24 hours. As your sealant and adhesive dry, it's important to stay off of your new floor. Even after your sealant is completely dry, keep traffic to a minimum until the underlying adhesive sets completely. Replacing your furniture too early or walking excessively on the floor can cause the still-pliable flooring to deform as it dries, leading to permanent bumps and divots.\n\n\nMany flooring adhesives will be sufficiently dry in 24 hours, but some may require longer drying times. Always defer to your manufacturer's directions and err on the side of caution. Prolonging a minor inconvenience in the short term can save you problems in the long term.",
                "Replace baseboards, appliances, furniture, etc. When your new linoleum floor has completely dried, you can start getting your room back to normal. Replace your baseboards, appliances, furniture, electrical outlet covers, and any other items you removed from the room to prepare it for its new floor. Take care during re-installation not to scratch, mar or damage your linoleum.\n\n\nKeep in mind that some of the items you replace (especially doors and baseboards) may need to be slightly raised or altered to accommodate the slightly higher floor level.\nFor very heavy furniture and appliances, use a piece of plywood to slide the fixture into place, rather than dragging it across the floor, as doing this can damage floors even after they've set.\nFor specific help re-installing some common room fixtures, see our installation articles on baseboards, doors, and appliances.",
                "Use caulk to seal the room's edges as needed. As you're returning your room to its original condition, don't forget that many room fixtures require their edges to be sealed with caulk to provide an air- and water-tight seal. Baseboards in particular can require extensive caulking, as can toilets, sinks, and other appliances that use water. Note that latex or acrylic latex-based caulk is usually best for most indoor projects.",
                "Use an online calculator. Though linoleum and vinyl flooring are fairly cheap compared to flooring options like hardwood and tile, you still won't want to spend any more money on your flooring project than necessary. Figuring out how much linoleum your project calls for beforehand can prevent you from wasting money on excessive flooring material and save you the hassle of having to run back to the hardware store if you don't have enough. For most projects, the easiest way to do this is simply to use an online calculator (like this one).\n\n\nThough online calculators will vary, most (including the one above) simply require you to input the length and width of your floor section (or sections) to receive a total estimate. For floor sections that are square or rectangular, you'll only need one length and width, but for a differently-shaped area of floor, you'll need to divide your square into rectangular sections and find a length and width for each to get an accurate total.",
                "Calculate your amount by hand. You don't need to use a calculator to figure out how much linoleum you need — it's also pretty easy to find this amount by hand. Use one of the equations below to determine exactly how much linoleum is necessary for your project depending on whether you're buying sheet linoleum by the yard or tiled linoleum.[4] Keep in mind that, regardless of the equation you use, your floor area value will be the length of your floor times its width (for each rectangular section of floor).\n\n\nFor sheet linoleum: (Floor area)/9 = # of Square yards of linoleum needed\nFor 9-inch tiles: (Floor area)/0.5626 = # of 9-inch linoleum tiles needed\nFor 12-inch tiles: (Floor area) = # of 12-inch linoleum tiles needed",
                "Buy a little bit more than you think you need. As with all home improvement projects, it's a smart use of your time to buy just a little extra when you're shopping for linoleum flooring. Just as you might buy extra concrete when pouring a new driveway, buying extra linoleum gives you the ability to correct for small mistakes you might make and also accounts for minor errors you may have made during the process of calculating the amount of linoleum you need. In addition, extra linoleum can be stored almost indefinitely and used to patch minor damage to your floor, line the bottom of cabinets under your sink, and for a variety of other home-improvement projects."

Newspaper may be the easiest source to start with, but you can also use old print-outs, notes, phone books - just about any un-waxed paper product.Keep in mind that the color of the papers you use and the amount of dark ink on them will affect the \"grayness\" of your creation. Avoid using any glossy or shiny paper - it won't work as well.\n\n\nPaper can also be made entirely of grass and leaves as well, in fact, that's how most paper was made until the 20th century! You must cut the vegetation in small pieces, soak it in caustic soda to \"digest\", strain it, and blend it to a pulp. Then pour it on the press. After it dries, you can proudly say, \"This paper contains no trees!\"",
                "Clean up the paper. Remove plastic, staples and other contaminants. Especially if you're using junk mail, your paper scraps are likely to contain plastic from envelope windows. Try to remove such impurities as thoroughly as possible.",
                "Tear the paper into small pieces. Don't spend to much time on this step, but do break up the paper into smaller pieces. A few rips per paper should be enough.",
                "Soak the paper in water. Put the smaller pieces of paper in a container (such as a bowl or cup) and cover them with water. Let them soak for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\nIf you want to make colored construction paper,use paper with the least amount of dark ink, use a lot of \"pulp\" and use liquid food coloring. The resulting paper will most likely be opaque on one side and bright on the other. Depending on your intended use, either side may be suitable, but the bright side will probably be better for writing.\nIf you want to have whiter paper, half a cup of white vinegar can be added to the pulp mixture.",
                "Turn the paper into pulp. Now that the recyclable paper is more wet and pliable, you can start the process of turning it into pulp - a thick, gooey, slightly watery substance that will eventually become your new piece of paper. Here are two possibilities:\n\n\nBlend the paper. Rip the paper into tiny bits, and place it all into a blender until it's about half full. Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender on \"slow\" at first, then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well-blended - approximately 30 to 40 seconds - just until there are no flakes of paper remaining.\n\nMash the paper. If you have a mortar and pestle (or something similar, like the end of a rolling pin and a sturdy bowl) available, you can mash up the paper by hand. Work a handful at a time, and aim to get the pulp so that it's similar to the consistency of watery oatmeal.",
                "Fill your basin about halfway with water. The basin should be a little wider and longer than your frame and approximately the same shape.\n\nIf you're using the frame method, fill the basin and add the pulp before you dip the frame.\nIf you're using the pan method, put the screen in the bottom of the pan before you add the water and mix in the pulp.",
                "Add the pulp to the basin and stir. The amount of pulp you add to the water will determine the thickness of the paper, and while you want a dense suspension of pulp to fully cover your screen in the next steps, you don't need to make the whole tub into sludge. Experiment a bit. The thickness of can be changed from paper to cardboard depending on the amount of water added to the pulp.",
                "Remove any large clumps of paper. Try to pick out any clumps; the smoother and finer your mixture, the more uniform your end product will be.",
                "Seize the paper (optional). If the paper is going to be used for stationery, stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp mix. The starch helps prevent ink from soaking into the paper fibers.\n\nIf you don't add starch, the paper will be highly absorbent, and your ink will likely bleed quite easily. If this occurs, briefly soak the dried paper in a mix of water and gelatin and re-dry.",
                "Immerse the frame in the mixture (frame method only). Place your wooden frame into the pulp, screen-side down, then level it while it is submerged. Lightly move it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen lies fairly uniformly flat.",
                "Lift the screen from the basin. Slowly lift up the screen until it is above the water. Drip-drain it over the basin. Wait until most of the water has drained from the pulp, and you'll see the beginnings of a new piece of paper. If the paper is very thick, remove some of the pulp from the top. If it is too thin, add some more pulp and stir the mixture again.",
                "Remove excess water from the paper. After you've lifted the screen out of the basin, you'll need to remove the extra water from the pulp. Depending on the method you chose in Step 1, here's how to do it:\n\n\nFrame method: After the water stops dripping (or nearly so), gently place a piece of fabric (felt or flannel, preferably) or a piece of Formica, (smooth-side down) in the frame on top of the \"paper\". Very gently press down to squeeze out excess water. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible from the other side of the screen, and periodically wring out the sponge.\n\nPan method: Lay a cloth towel out on a flat surface, and put the screen (with the paper on it) on one half of the towel. Fold the other half over so that it's on top of the paper. With a clothes iron on low setting, gently iron over the towel. You should see a little steam from the paper coming up.",
                "Remove the paper from the screen. Once the paper is a little more dry, you can lift it from the screen. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.\n\nGently lift the fabric or Formica out of the frame. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the screen, you may have pulled too fast or not pressed out enough water.\nYou can press a drying sheet of paper by placing another piece of fabric or Formica on top of it and gently pressing. This will make the resulting paper smoother and thinner. Leave the second piece there as it dries.",
                "Peel the paper off the screen slowly. If you find that it's not coming off easily, try ironing it underneath the towel again.",
                "Set the paper out to dry. Take the piece of paper and lay it out to dry on a flat surface. Alternatively, you can speed up the drying process by using a hair dryer on the low setting.\n\nPeel the paper off the fabric or Formica (frame method only). Wait until the sheets of paper are thoroughly dried; then gently peel.\n\nIroning (optional): When the paper is damp, but safe to move peel the fabric/Formica from the paper and then use an iron set on high to dry the paper quickly and give it a nice shine.",
                "Repeat the above steps to make additional sheets. Continue adding pulp and water to the basin as needed."

                "Play a sport.[3] Summer is a great time for outdoor sports. Volleyball, tennis, and soccer are all great summer sports that can help you get fit. Sports are an especially great way to get fit during the summer if you are competitive.",
                "Get involved in your community.[4] Many communities host triathlons, yoga classes, and runs during the summer. Some might also offer the opportunity to join a community basketball or soccer team. Check your local community events page online or contact community development organizations and ask if they offer fitness classes or sports programs.[5]",
                "Head into the great outdoors.[6] Walking and biking in the forest is a great way to get fit during the summer. Enjoy the fresh air, the quietude, and the simplicity of communing with nature. Lose yourself on a mountain path or a hiking trail. Visit your local public park for hiking and biking opportunities.",
                "Go running.[7][8] Running is a low-cost exercise that can get you fit quickly. All you need is a comfortable, well-fitting pair of tennis shoes and your legs to take you wherever you want to run. You could run along a natural trail, on a community track, or on a treadmill.\n\n\nStart by walking for about five minutes. This will stretch and warm up your leg muscles.\nStart at a time or distance you feel comfortable with. For instance, you might start out by running ten minutes each day. Add minutes or distance every few days to continue building your running endurance and strength.\nWhen you’re close to finishing your run, sprint hard for about thirty to sixty seconds. If you do this before ending your run every time, you’ll be able to build speed as well as endurance during your runs.\nWhen you’re done running, walk around for about five minutes to cool down.",
                "Hit the gym.[9] Working out at the gym offers tons of options and possibilities for getting fit. Try a variety of exercises and focus on the ones you like best.\n\n\nCardio (or aerobic) workouts involve working the heart in whole-body exercises like biking, running, jumping rope, or walking.\nAnaerobic workouts could include bench presses, push-ups, pull-ups, chin-ups, sit-ups, lunges, and squats. These are the best exercises for burning fat and building muscle.\nSwitch back and forth between cardio and anaerobic exercises. For instance, run for 30 minutes, then do 30 pushups.\nIf you're unfamiliar with gym equipment or certain exercises, ask the staff for assistance. For an added cost, many gyms also offer personal workout trainers to help you develop a routine that works for you.",
                "Start small.[10] It’s best to start small when getting fit. For instance, start out by walking or running two miles each day, depending on your current physical fitness level. After you can easily do two miles (usually after a week or so of daily workouts), start doing two and a half miles. Increase your distance to three miles after another week. Continue adding distance until you feel you’re working out at your maximum capability.",
                "Keep a food diary.[11] A food diary is a log in which you record everything you eat, along with its calorie count, each day. A good way to keep a food diary is to record your meals and snacks on your phone. You could use a simple notation file to track your meals, or you could try an app like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, or Noom Coach.[12]\n\nSince you’re not just monitoring what you eat, but also working out, it’s a good idea to add a workout aspect to this food diary, too. Add two additional columns to each day’s diary entries briefly describing the day’s workout routine and tallying how many calories you estimate you burned.",
                "Eat fruits and vegetables.[13] The health benefits of fruits and vegetables are almost too numerous to list. The high water content in fruits and veggies will leave you feeling full but not add a significant calorie load to your diet. Their high fiber content will keep your gut clean and operating efficiently. Fruit contains many phytochemicals (naturally occurring compounds) that promote good health.[14]\n\nAim to eat at least two cups of produce each day.",
                "Get lots of fiber.[15] Foods with fiber take longer to digest than less-fibrous foods, meaning the will keep you feeling full longer. In addition to fruits and vegetables, popcorn, brown rice, and whole grain bread are some foods that pack in fiber that can get you fit during the summer.",
                "Avoid fatty foods.[16] Unless you’re adhering to a very intense workout schedule, you should try to limit your fat intake. Stay away from fast food, fatty snacks like potato chips, and other junk foods. Get your fats from avocado, olive oil, peanut butter, nuts and other natural sources of fat for your fat needs.\n\n\nSaturated fats are especially bad for your heart health. These are fats that can raise your blood pressure quickly. No more than 5% of your daily calories (or about 13 grams) should be from saturated fats.[17]",
                "Eat early.[18] Have an adequate (but not too big) breakfast. Try to eat most of your calories by 3:00 each day. If you eat most of your calories earlier in the day, you’ll be able to draw on that energy throughout the day and won’t need to eat as much as the day continues. This will keep you from eating continuously throughout the day.\n\n\nGranola with banana or berries makes a great breakfast. Other healthy options include whole-grain toast with jam, oatmeal with fruit, or a vegetable smoothie.",
                "Don’t deny yourself everything. You might struggle with the temptation to eat fatty, sugary, and salty foods -- the very foods that you should avoid when trying to get and stay fit. Unless you have superhuman will power, you might give in to their temptations sometimes. You should not set up specific rules against eating any one food.[19]\n\nSummer is a great time to eat ice cream, for instance. As long as you don’t make a regular habit of having a post-workout ice-cream cone -- thus negating any benefits you might have gained from working out -- it’s probably okay for you to have some ice cream once in a while.\nMaintain portion control when eating foods that you usually wouldn’t indulge in.",
                "Make a list detailing why you want to get fit.[20] For instance, you might want to have more energy. You might want to give yourself a more positive mental outlook. Maybe you just want to achieve overall good health. Whatever your reason(s), list them and be specific. Tack this list to your fridge or another visible location and consult it daily, especially when you feel tired from your exercise regimen.",
                "Set your goals.[21] Do not go into the summer without solid goals. Ensure your fitness goals are achievable, realistic, and specific. For instance, do not make a goal like, “I want to get fit.” Instead, make a goal with quantifiable data, like, “I want to lose ten pounds,” or “I want to be able to do fifty pushups.”\n\n\nA realistic weight loss goal is to lose two pounds each week. Use this baseline to determine how much you can lose.\nDon’t schedule gym time for yourself every day if you cannot make it to the gym each day.\nGetting fit will be hard.[22] Expect to put in lots of work to get fit over the summer.",
                "Create a plan.[23] Now that you know your goals, figure out how you can achieve them. Your plan should include both an exercise and nutrition aspect. Write the plan down.\n\n\nYour nutrition aspect might be, for instance, “Consume no more than 1,800 calories each day.”\nYour exercise aspect of the plan might read, “Exercise for one hour each day except Wednesday and Sunday.”\nFeel free to modify your plan as the summer progresses. If you think your current plan is too rigorous -- or not rigorous enough -- add or remove steps and benchmarks as needed.",
                "Incorporate fitness technology into your summer.[24] There are a variety of apps available that can help you get fit over the summer. Fitness tracking devices like FitBit can also be helpful in helping you monitor your progress and achieve your goals.\n\n\nYogaia is a mobile app that provides guidance and training for yoga moves. Using it to do yoga on your own can save money that would have been used for classes.\nLifesum is an app that provides a personalized nutrition plan based on how much you exercise and what your fitness goals are.\nUse a health and fitness tracking device like FitBit to help you track your biometrics (the data of your body). FitBit can track how far you’ve run, how many steps you’ve taken, and what your heartbeat is during different times of day.",
                "Take pictures of yourself each week.[25] Look back over these pictures, and compare each new picture to pictures from prior weeks. If you are on track with your fitness goals, your body will become visibly toned and muscular. You can use these images to remind yourself how far you’ve come on your path to good health.\n\n\nYou could also post the pictures on social media to receive praise and positive feedback from friends and family. This feedback can also function as a great source of motivation.",
                "Get support. If you have friends who have also expressed interest in getting fit over the summer, propose a contest in which the individual who loses the most weight over the summer wins. A friendly contest among friends or coworkers can motivate all of you.[26]\n\nMoney is also a great motivator. For an added twist, you and your friends could put up some money as a prize for whoever loses the most weight. If you and five friends put in $20, the winner could get $100 at the end of the summer.\nYou could also make a rule that if someone doesn’t lose at least one pound by the end of each week (compared to their previous week’s weight), they must add $10 to the prize pot.",
                "Have fun.[27] Getting in shape can be a challenge, but it can also provide great opportunities for fun. Invite your friends to go walking or swimming with you. Get a gym buddy to accompany you on your workouts.\n\n\nExercise also produces endorphins, a kind of biological chemical that makes you feel good.\nThinking about your workouts as something other than drudgery can help you stay on track. Think of your workout sessions as personal time, or a personal reward or mini-vacation from your regular work life.[28]"

        "How to Determine if Your Cat is Overweight": {
            "intro": "On average, a medium or small cat should weight between 7 and 13 pounds. A large cat should weigh between 13 and 24 pounds.[1] However, like people cats vary in shape and size. Your cat might fall outside of these ranges and still be healthy. Doing a body check can help you determine if your cat's weight is a problem. If you're concerned after evaluating your cat, make an appointment to your vet. Obesity can increase your cat's risk for a variety of health problems and shorten his overall lifespan. It's important you make sure your cat is at a healthy weight for his size.",
            "steps": [
                "Look at your cat from different angles. You can start determining if your cat's overweight by looking at him. Examining your cat from above and from the side should help you determine if his weight is a problem.\n\n\nLook at your cat from above. The area between his ribs and hips should move inward slightly, creating a clearly defined waist. If there is no waist or if his waist is wider than either his hips or ribs, your cat may be overweight.[2]\n\nYou should also look at your cat from the side. Cats who are at a healthy weight have what is called an abdominal tuck. This means the area just behind their ribs should have a smaller diameter than the chest. If you do not see an abdominal tuck, your cat may be overweight.[3]",
                "Touch your cat's ribs. You can further examine your cat by touching him. Run your hand over your cat's sides. You should be able to easily feel his ribs. If you cannot feel his ribs, or have to push down to do so, your cat may be overweight.[4]",
                "Examine the base of your cat's tail. You should also be able to feel bones near the base of your cat's tail. While there should be a small layer of fat protecting this area, you should be able to feel the outlines of his bones without much effort. If you cannot easily feel bones here, your cat may be overweight.[5]",
                "Check other bony areas. A cat's spine, hips, and shoulders should also be fairly bony. While very visible and pointy bones may indicate your cat is underweight, in a healthy cat you should be able to easily detect hip bones, spine bones, and shoulder bones through gentle petting. If you're unable to feel these bones due to layers of fat, your cat is overweight.[6]",
                "Do not be overly concerned about a saggy belly. Many cats have a saggy bit of flesh that hangs down between their back legs. If your cat is otherwise bony, this small pouch of skin is unlikely to be an indication of a weight problem. This skin flap is referred to as the \"primordial pouch\" and its purpose is to protect the stomach during fights with other cats. Cats often kick with their back legs when angry, and this flap of skin protects your cat from such attacks. Many cats will develop a primordial pouch at some point in their lives and it is not necessarily an indicator of feline obesity.[7]\n\nHowever, excess fat may be stored in your cat's primordial pouch if he is overweight. If he shows other symptoms of obesity, check his pouch. It should hang loose and be mostly comprised of skin. If the pouch seems to be filling out with fat, this can be an indicator of obesity.[8]",
                "Make an appointment with your vet. If you're concerned after doing a body check, you should take your cat to see a veterinarian. You can weigh your cat yourself at home but it's better to take him to the vet. The scales at a vet's office are specifically designed for use on animals. A vet will also be able to determine if your cat is medically obese considering his body type. While a body check can give you insight as to whether you should be concerned, professional veterinary evaluation is important when diagnosing your cat as overweight or obese.",
                "Determine the cause of your cat's weight gain. When you're at the vet's office, your vet will ask you a variety of questions regarding your cat. This helps determine whether your cat's weight is due to environmental or medical factors.\n\n\nObesity in cats can be the result of environmental factors. Your vet will want to know how often you feed your cat as overfeeding can lead to weight gain. If your cat hides a lot due to fear of children or other pets, he may not be getting enough exercise. Your cat also may be bored and not have enough toys or entertainment. You might have to adjust your home environment to help your cat lose weight.[9]\n\nHowever, environment is not always the cause. Some medications, diseases, and medical conditions can cause your cat to gain weight. If your cat has any other troublesome symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, let your vet know. He or she may want to conduct certain tests or lab work on your cat to rule out an underlying medical problem.[10]",
                "Discuss your cat's diet with your vet. If your cat's weight gain is environmental, talk to your vet about how you feed your cat. He or she can suggest changes you can make to get your cat to a healthier weight. It's important you talk over major changes to your cat's diet with your vet beforehand.",
                "Change how you feed your cat. If your cat is overweight, you'll need to change how you feed him. Changing a cat's feeding schedule can make a huge difference in regards to his weight.\n\n\nAlways make transitions gradual. If you suddenly swap out a cat's old food for a new diet brand, he may act out or refuse to eat. Keep your cat on his regular food but offer him a little bit of the new food you're trying each day.[11]\n\nCats will work for food. You can use a foraging device, which is a puzzle-like device a cat must dismantle to get food trapped inside. This encourages exercise which is also important to help a cat lose weight.[12]\n\nIn nature, cats are pure carnivores. A lot of dry foods are primarily wheat-based and can lead to weight gain if used as a primary food source. Talk to your vet about switching your cat over to canned food.[13]",
                "Encourage exercise. Many cats do not get enough exercise. If your cat is an indoor cat, it's especially important he gets moving each day. Buy your cat a variety of toys and take 20 to 30 minutes each night to play with him. Consider getting electronic, interactive toys a cat can use while you're away at work.[14]",
                "Go for diet treats. Treats are also a major culprit when it come to cat weight gain. Try swapping out normal treats for low-calorie diet treats. Your cat won't have to give up a luxury and will still be able to lose some weight.[15]",
                "Monitor your cat's weight. Keep an eye on your cat's weight to make sure he's losing weight as needed. You can weigh your cat at home, using your own scale. This may not be as accurate as a vet's scale, however. Some veterinary clinics allow you to do free weigh-ins if your cat needs to lose weight. Ask your vet is you can periodically bring your cat in to check his weight."

Ideally you should plant at least two pear trees because they need to be pollinated by another tree in order to bear a good crop of fruit.[2]\n\nIf you can’t manage to plant more than one then you’ll need to rely on there being another pear tree fairly nearby that can fertilize your own tree.\nTry to pick out two different kinds of pear trees; it is beneficial if your pear is pollinated by a different cultivar that flowers at the same time. Trees will need at least 20 feet (6.1 m) of spacing between them.",
                "Follow the correct planting technique. To plant the tree in the ground, make a hole the same depth as the roots, but at least twice the diameter. Place the plant in the planting hole and fill in the soil, eliminating any air pockets.\n\n\nGently firm down the soil and water well. You can add a slow release (granular) fertilizer but avoid other kinds of fertilizers as this will cause damage.\nYou shouldn’t need to prune your tree the first year but consider fertilizing lightly in the first spring.",
                "Water the young tree regularly in dry periods until established. It can take a year or two for your tree to become established. Even established pear trees will appreciate a watering in dry periods. Try to water deeply at long intervals rather than giving less water at shorter intervals.\n\n\nAs a guide, you should water your tree when the soil feels fairly dry about three inches below the surface of the soil. Don’t water against the trunk but instead keep the water at the edges of the leaf canopy.",
                "Apply a small amount of fertilizer early in the year. An effective way to apply fertilizer is to sprinkle a granular fertilizer around the base of the tree in early spring. If your soil is very fertile, use less fertilizer.\n\n\nFertilizer will keep your tree growing strong and healthy. Fertilizer gives your tree an added boost of nutrients that can help it to flourish.",
                "Adjust the amount of fertilizer depending on the tree’s growth. If you see pale or yellowish foliage on your tree over the summer then use a bit more fertilizer the following spring.\n\n\nIf your tree grows by more than about a foot over the summer, apply less fertilizer the next year.",
                "Avoid over-fertilizing your tree. While the right amount of fertilizer can keep your tree healthy, too much fertilizer, especially if high in nitrogen, makes trees more susceptible to fire blight. Don’t feel you have to fertilize your tree regularly.",
                "Follow some general pruning guidelines. Pruning timing and method depends on your variety but these general rules apply:\n\n\nDon’t prune pear trees heavily but do prune them regularly.\nPrune when the tree is dormant and before the spring growth period starts.",
                "Prune for your variety. Dwarf pear trees need a different approach to pruning than standard-sized trees. Timing and method will vary depending on your variety.\n\nIf you do not not when you should prune your tree, talk to an employee at your local plant nursery, or run an online search for your specific kind of tree.",
                "Thin the fruit. Try to thin your tree’s fruit, leaving around six inches of space between each cluster of fruit on a branch.\n\n\nWhen possible, thin the fruit out by picking the ripe fruit from the tree; that way, both your tree and your belly stay happy and healthy.",
                "Remove any unhealthy growth. Always remove any crossing, rubbing, weak, dead, diseased, damaged or dying branches. Any diseased growth should be burnt rather than placed in the compost bin so as to keep the disease from spreading.",
                "Understand what fire blight is. Fire blight is an especial problem for pear trees and can severely damage or kill your tree. Affected trees look like they have been burnt. This disease is caused by insects that bring the disease to the tree.[3]",
                "Take steps to prevent fire blight. To keep fire blight at by, select a pear variety that is resistant to the problem. Help your tree resist fire blight by keeping it well watered during the spring and summer; mulching will also help conserve water.\n\n\nDon’t prune your tree too heavily as new growth is more susceptible to fire blight than old.",
                "Prune away parts of the tree that have been affected by fire blight. If your tree is affected, prune each affected bit of growth to at least three inches below where the damage is visible.\n\n\nSterilize your cutting tool after making each cut. Use a solution of chlorine to do this. This is a precaution to take to keep the disease from spreading.\nAfter removing the affected growth, be sure to burn it and avoid composting the diseased growth.\nIf your tree is very badly affected it may need to be replaced. Select a resistant variety when replacing it.",
                "Learn how to deal with other potential diseases. Apart from fire blight, pear trees can be affected by other diseases:\n\n\nBrown rot is sometimes a problem in wet summers. You’ll see the fruit rot into a brown color with white patches. Dispose of the affected fruit.\nPear rust causes orange leaf spots; you just need to remove and burn affected growth as you would for fire blight.\nPear leaf blister mite causes yellow or red leaf blisters that turn black. Again you just need to remove and destroy affected foliage; it’s still okay to eat the fruit.",
                "Know that the weather can work against you. Despite all the care you put into your tree, sometimes you just have to accept the weather can work against you. Late frosts and hail storms will dislodge buds, leading to poor fruit set. It’s difficult to protect against this.\n\nIt’s also normal to see pear trees drop fruit in the summer. It’s especially likely if the tree is young or under pressure from lack of water or pest attack."

            "intro": "Character comes from the Greek word kharakter, which means basically \"to engrave with a stick.\" Think of character like a stamp that you use to make an impression in the wax of your self.[1] Whatever your age or experience, building character is a process of lifelong learning that involves experience, leadership, and a constant dedication to growth and maturity. Start building it now.",
            "steps": [
                "Take risks. Like an athlete needs to learn to lose to better appreciate a victory, a person needs to risk failure in order to build character. Character is built when a person faces the possibility of failure. Learn to push yourself toward success, handle coming up short, and become a better person regardless of the outcome. Taking risks means committing to challenging projects that might be too difficult to take on.\n\n\nPut yourself out there. Approach the cute the barista and risk getting shot down when you ask for a date. Volunteer for extra responsibilities at work, even if you're not sure you'll be able to do them. Decide what you want out of life and grab it.\nDon't come up with reasons to not do things, look for reasons to act. Take a risk by going on that rock climbing trip with your friends, even if you haven't learned how to do it and are worried about embarrassing yourself. Take a risk by applying to those graduate schools with small student bodies. Don't invent excuses, invent reasons.\nBuilding character doesn't mean acting recklessly when it comes to your safety. Driving recklessly, or abusing substances has nothing to do with building character. Take productive risks.",
                "Surround yourself with people of high character. Identify people in your life that you respect, people who you think exhibit desirable character traits. For different people, this will mean different traits and different people. Decide what you want to be like, what makes the best version of yourself, and find people like that.\n\n\nHang out with people who are older than you. Increasingly, we spend less and less time as a culture learning from our elders. As a young person, make it a goal to befriend someone much older than yourself and learn from their perspective. Spend time with older relatives, talking and learning.\nHang out with people very different than you. If you tend toward a quiet and reserved personality, you might think of someone with an uncensored and loud way of talking has good character, and can learn to loosen up a little bit and speak your mind.\nHang out with people you admire. The best way to build character is to hang around people you admire, who you want to be like, and who you can learn from. Don't surround yourself with sycophants or convenient friends. Befriend powerful people you want to model yourself after.",
                "Get out of your comfort zone. Building character means learning how to handle tough or uncomfortable situations. Volunteer helping at-risk kids after school, or spend time doing mission work through your church. Head to a local black metal show and see what it's like. Find ways to shake up the status quo and understand other people on a complicated level.\n\n\nTravel to uncomfortable places and figure out how to make yourself feel at home. Walk around a town you've never been in and get someone to ask you for directions.",
                "Get a job that isn’t fun, at least once. Mopping up the gunk under the meat grinder at the fast food restaurant? Toiling under a hot summer sun mixing mortar? Dealing with angry customers at the shoe store? Less than desirable ways to spend your Saturday afternoons, it's true, but having difficult jobs is an excellent way of building character. Money becomes more valuable and more meaningful when you see what it takes to make it in the world.\n\n\nHaving a bad job helps you learn a lot about the way different business work, and the struggle some people face. Working at McDonalds is a difficult and dignified job and a person of high character will recognize that. Be a more open-minded and understanding person by working.",
                "Commit to self-improvement. Building character is an essential part of life-long learning. If you want to be a person that other people look to for inspiration, someone respected in your community and spoken of as a person of high character, make an active effort to improve yourself day in and day out.\n\n\nTake small steps toward building your character. Pick one thing that you'd like to work on at a time. Maybe you want to be a better listener with your partner, or be more committed at work. Take it a day at a time and build the skills slowly.\nIt's common to look back on yourself in your younger years and be embarrassed. Bad haircuts, outbursts, and immaturity. Don't be embarrassed. Take your embarrassment as a sign that you're building character.",
                "Learn to empathize. Found among Lincoln's papers after his death was a stern note to a particular general who had failed to follow orders, in which Lincoln wrote that he was \"distressed immeasurably\" at the general's conduct. It's harsh, personal, and cutting. [2] Interestingly enough, the note was never sent, probably because Lincoln–a great leader by any standard–had learned to empathize with the general, who had seen more blood at Gettysburg than Lincoln could have imagined. He gave the general the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\nIf a friend stands you up when you had plans, or if your boss fails to mention all the hard work you put in at a meeting, a person of character will let it slide sometimes. Learn from the past and be more cautious and calculated with your expectations next time.\nA person of character focuses on the bigger picture. Tearing the general a new one would have accomplished nothing but alienating him from Lincoln, making the situation worse. What's done is done, and what's past is past. Try to focus on the future.",
                "Let yourself vent in private. Just because Lincoln didn't send the letter doesn't mean it wasn't important for him to write. No one, no matter how strong of character, can be made of ice. You're going to get angry, frustrated, and upset. That's a part of life. Burying those emotions into the depths of your person won't help you build character, so it's important to make room for venting sometimes, but in a private way that'll keep your public character safe. Find a relaxing activity to help you process frustrations and anger, so you can let it go.\n\n\nWrite angry screeds in a notebook, then tear it out and burn it. Listen to Slayer while you lift heavy stuff at the gym. Go running. Find a physical and healthy way to get the frustration out of your system and let it go.\nOn House of Cards, Frank Underwood, stoic and sleazy politician, likes to blow off steam playing violent video games after a long day of cutting deals in the House of Representatives. It's more than just a funny character trait: everyone needs a way to unwind. Find yours.",
                "Open up to a variety of people. A person of character is able to communicate openly with lots of different kinds of people. Don't be insular. character comes from learning as much as you can from different sorts of people. Have long talks with the guy at the BBQ joint you frequent, and with the bartender, as well as your coworkers, your friends, and your family. Listen to what they have to say. Be honest with them. This helps to build character.\n\n\nIf you need to vent, find mutually-beneficial vent partners and meet up to open up with each other. Then talk about other things and focus on happier times. Don't just dwell on the bad.",
                "Lose graciously. As James Michener once put it, character has to do with what you do on the third and fourth try, not the first. How do you approach a difficult or a losing situation? Learn to face defeat and lose graciously and you'll start building strong character traits.\n\n\nCompete at little things to help learn this skill. It's hard to learn to lose graciously when you're talking about major, life-changing competitions, like getting into college, competing for a job, or more serious competitive moments. Build these traits playing board games, sports, and other littler ways of competing, so you can have the essential foundation for the more important stuff.\nBe a good winner, too. Remember how it feels to come up short and neither condescend nor criticizer the loser. Celebrate in private, but celebrate.",
                "Challenge yourself with difficult goals. A person of character should lead by example, taking on challenges that won't come easily. Whether at school, work, or wherever you are, take on difficult projects and commit to doing them the right way.\n\n\nIn school, don't challenge yourself to get \"good grades,\" challenge yourself to do the best work that you're capable of doing. Maybe an A isn't high enough for what you can achieve.\nAt work, volunteer for extra responsibilities, put in extra hours at the office, and go above and beyond each time you do your work. Whatever you do, do it right.\nAt home, commit to bettering yourself in your free time. Nights that might be spent aimlessly shuffling things around your Netflix queue could be spend learning guitar, or getting cracking on that novel you've always wanted to write, or fixing up that old roadster. Take your hobbies seriously.",
                "Use setbacks as fuel. FailCon is a Silicon Valley conference that celebrates failure as an essential part of success. Failure is just a speed bump on the way to getting what you want, eliminating one possibility from a list of possibilities. Fail early and fail often, take your licks, and learn what you can the next time you reorganize and set yourself up for a better outcome.\n\n\nGo about failure in a scientific way. If you started a company that ended up bankrupt, or if your band just broke up, or if you lost your job, welcome the failure. There, you might say, was one wrong answer that you can check off the list of possible right answers. You're just making your job easier.",
                "Stop looking to others for approval. Sometimes psychologists talk about inner and outer locus of control. People with an \"inner locus\" are satisfied from within, looking to satisfy themselves and worry less about what other people think. People with an outer locus, on the other hand, are pleasers. While self-sacrifice can seem like a character trait that's desirable, pleasing others to please yourself keeps other people in the driver's seat. If you want to take control of your life and your developing character, learn to worry about doing what you think is right, not what your boss, your partner, or other forces in your life tell you.",
                "Think big. Dream your dreams and define big goals for yourself. What would be the best possible version of your life? Jump in headfirst. If you want to be a professional musician, move to the big city, form a band, and start gigging. Make no excuses. If you want to be a writer, find a job that gives you ample time to practice your craft and set a word-count goal each day on your novel. Write like mad. Aim for the top.\n\n\nA person of high character is also someone satisfied with what they have. Maybe for you, staying in your hometown, marrying your sweetheart, and having some kids is the best possible life you can imagine. Go for it. Pop the question and be satisfied.",
                "Find a ladder and start climbing it. Decide what you want and find the route that will take you to it. If you want to be a doctor, figure out what medical schools will give you the best chance of getting a job, and commit to the grind of getting through the med school and residency process. Throw yourself into the work and the learning. Grab the brass ring.",
                "Learn to recognize and embrace your defining moments. Defining moments are easy to see in retrospect. Moments in which your mettle was tested, or your character was put to a challenge. A person of character will learn to recognize and anticipate those moments, to figure out what you might regret doing, or not doing, in the future, and making the right choice. There's no one way to do this, but it's got to do with how honest and familiar you are with yourself.[3]\n\nTry to imagine all the possible outcomes of a given situation. If you're thinking about moving across the country to pursue a career in acting, what might happen? What will happen if you stay? Can you live with either outcome? What does it mean to \"make it\"?\nA person of high character, when recognizing defining moments, makes the right decision. If you're being tempted to stab a coworker in the back to get ahead, is it the right choice for you if it comes with a bigger paycheck? Will you be able to live with it? Only you can make that call.",
                "Stay busy and avoid idleness. People of high character are doers, not talkers. When you decide to act, don't put your plan somewhere in the hypothetical future, roll it into motion right now, this second. Start doing what you want to do today.\n\n\nPeople of high character avoid indulgent behavior. Sleeping the day away, staying out all night drinking, and loafing around for no reason are not generally the behaviors of people high in character. Be a moral compass, not a beacon of sloth.\nTry to align your hobbies and your work as much as possible. If you enjoy reading books and daydreaming, go into academics and put your poetic senses to good use. If you like punching heavy bags, become a gym rat and start working at the gym. If you're doing what you want to do, you'll build character."

It’s important that you go for nutrient-rich food sources for these extra calories and keep a close eye on not going over 500 extra calories a day.[3]\n\nHowever, as you breastfeed, you are not required to increase your calorie intake and you can maintain a very similar diet to your diet when you were pregnant. Avoid over consuming on calories as this can stall your post-pregnancy weight loss, which is an important part of recovering from your pregnancy.[4]",

To give your breast milk higher nutritional value for your baby, maintain a diet that is rich in good sources of protein. Lean meat like chicken, as well as eggs, milk, beans, and lentils are all good additions to your diet.[5]\n\nIf you are maintaining a daily calorie intake of 2400 calories, you should have three cups a day of dairy, such as yogurt, milk, or cheese, as well as six and a half ounces of meat and beans, such as fish, lean meat, beans, and nuts.[6]\n\nYou should always look for seafood that is low in mercury to avoid increasing the mercury levels in your body.

Remember to always wash your fruits and vegetables before consuming them to reduce your exposure, and your baby’s exposure, to pesticide residue.[7]\n\nIf you are maintaining a daily calorie intake of 2400 calories, aim for three cups a day of vegetables, such as leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, orange vegetables like peppers and carrots, and starchy vegetables like squash and potatoes. You should also have two cups a day of a variety of fruits, and eight ounces of whole grains a day.[8]",
                "Try to eat a variety of different foods. Having a variety of foods as you breastfeed will actually change the flavor of your breast milk and expose your baby to different tastes. This will help your baby expand her palate and ease into solid foods when she gets older.[9]\n\nMost babies will enjoy the flavors of food that come through your breast milk and most mothers do not need to avoid certain foods as they breastfeed.",
                "Note any allergic reactions your baby has to foods that you eat. Sometimes, your baby can be sensitive to something you eat, like dairy products or spicy foods, and may display symptoms of an allergy. Keep in mind if your baby displays any sensitivity symptoms or an allergic reaction, she is responding to the food you ate and not to your breast milk itself. If you stop eating the foods that seem to bother your baby or eat less of it, the symptoms should fade on their own. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about your baby’s reaction to the foods in your breast milk. Your baby may display symptoms of a reaction, including:[10]\n\nA green stool that contains mucus and/or blood.\nDiarrhea and vomiting.\nA rash, eczema, hives, or dry skin.\nFussiness during and/or after feedings.\nCrying for long periods of time and appearing inconsolable.\nWaking suddenly in discomfort.\nWheezing or coughing.\nIf your baby displays any of these symptoms within minutes of breastfeeding or within 4 to 24 hours of breastfeeding, try to stop eating certain foods to determine the source of the allergy or sensitivity. If your baby has problems breathing, call 911 or head to the nearest emergency room.",
                "Ask your doctor about vitamin and mineral supplements. Your breast milk, coupled with a healthy balanced diet, should provide enough vitamins and minerals for you and your baby. But if you’re concerned about providing enough nutrients for both of you, talk to your doctor about taking vitamin and mineral supplements.[11]\n\nYour doctor should check your vitamin A, D, B6, and B12 levels to ensure you have enough nutrients in your body. Undernourished mothers or mothers with health issues may need to take vitamins and minerals like vitamin D supplements and vitamin B12 supplements.",
                "Increase your nutritional intake if you follow a vegetarian diet. Mothers who have a restrictive diet may require more nutrients through adjustments to their diet and vitamin supplements.[12]\n\nYour diet should be high in foods that contain iron, protein, and calcium. This includes lentils, whole-grain products, peas, and dark leafy green vegetables. You should also eat citrus fruits to help your body absorb the iron in your food. Your diet should contain foods rich in protein like eggs and dairy products or plant based protein sources like tofu, soy milk, and soy yogurt.\nYour doctor can also recommend daily vitamin B-12 supplements, which are essential for your baby’s brain development. You also may need vitamin D supplements if you have limited sun exposure and you do not eat vitamin-D rich foods like cow’s milk. Vitamin D is essential for your baby’s diet as it can help her absorb calcium and phosphorus.",
                "Drink water after every feeding. Your fluid intake does not affect the amount of breast milk you produce, but you should drink when you’re thirsty and try to drink water after every feeding. Try to stick to just water and avoid drinks high in added sugars, like soft drinks and fruit drinks.[13]",
                "Limit yourself to less than three cups of coffee or caffeinated beverages a day. Be careful about consuming too much caffeine, as it can cause your baby to act fussy and not sleep well. You can drink a moderate amount, up to three cups a day of coffee or other caffeinated beverages.[14]",
                "Limit alcohol while breastfeeding. It is okay to have a drink now and then while you are breast feeding. A small amount of alcohol in your breast milk is unlikely to harm your baby, especially if your baby is more than a few months old.[15] If you have more an one drink, then you may want to avoid breast-feeding until the alcohol has been cleared out of your system.[16]\n\nDepending on your body weight, 12 ounces of 5 percent beer, 5 ounces of 11 percent wine, or 1.5 ounces of 40 percent liquor takes two to three hours to clear out of your body.\nDo not try to pump and dump your breast milk in an attempt to speed up the removal of the alcohol from your breast milk, as this will not work. The best course is to wait a sufficient amount of time for the alcohol to clear your system."

        "wikiHow to Treat Adrenal Fatigue": {
            "intro": "If you suffer from symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, and sleep and mood disturbances, you may have a condition called adrenal fatigue. A controversial and unconventional diagnosis, adrenal fatigue can have a serious affect on an individual’s life. With a diagnosis from a health care professional, you can treat adrenal dysfunction using natural therapies including diet, meditation, and herbal supplements.",
            "steps": [
                "Know the symptoms. Adrenal fatigue is a syndrome that occurs when the adrenal glands work below the necessary levels for your body to function properly.[1] The syndrome is a term applied to a collection of nonspecific symptoms, including pain, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and digestive problems.[2]\n\nBeyond fatigue, pain, anxiety, sleep disorders and digestive problems, the symptoms of adrenal fatigue include: asthma, allergies, dizziness, dry skin, frequent urination, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, low sex drive, numbness in your fingers, poor circulation, and weight gain.[3]\n\nThe symptoms of adrenal fatigue are non-specific and can be from any number of other illnesses.\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it’s best to see a health care professional to get a diagnosis.",
                "Know the causes of the syndrome. Adrenal fatigue is caused when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones your body needs to function properly. While it can present with the above-mentioned symptoms, many people will show no symptoms at all.\n\n\nAdrenal fatigue is usually associated with intense or prolonged stress. But the syndrome can also appear as a result of acute or chronic infections, influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia.[4]\n\nAs the name suggests, the most prominent symptom of the syndrome is fatigue. You may not even notice that you have adrenal fatigue, but simply feel a general sense of being unwell or fatigue.[5]",
                "Know about the controversy. While there is a wealth of information available on the internet about adrenal fatigue, it is a controversial diagnosis. Not recognized as an actual condition by medical doctors, most proponents of adrenal fatigue are holistic and alternative medicine practitioners.[6]\n\nMedical doctors, including those at renowned institutions such as the Mayo Clinic, don’t recognize adrenal fatigue as an illness; however, they do support the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency or Addison’s Disease to denote inadequate production of one or more of the hormones essential to life that the adrenal glands produce.[7]\n\nThe symptoms of Addison’s Disease are similar to adrenal fatigue and include: fatigue, body aches, unexplained weight loss, low blood pressure, lightheadedness, loss of body hair, and skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation).[8]\n\nProponents of adrenal fatigue maintain that the syndrome is a mild form of adrenal insufficiency caused by chronic stress. They theorize that the adrenal glands are unable to handle constant stress and thus can't produce enough of the hormones an individual needs to feel well. According to their theory, blood tests cannot detect this minute change in adrenal function, but the body can.[9]\n\nYou may notice that many sites with information about adrenal fatigue will not give you complete information, but instead will prompt you to buy books and products.",
                "Get diagnosed with adrenal dysfunction. If you have the symptoms of adrenal dysfunction and are concerned that you may have the syndrome, get tested by a medical professional. You should also consider getting tested for Addison’s Disease and other illnesses, since the symptoms of adrenal function overlap with them.\n\n\nRemember that a medical doctor may not recognize your concern about adrenal fatigue and may test you for Addison’s Disease or another illness.\nAdrenal dysfunction can be tested by various methods. Your doctor or health care professional may prescribe blood tests to analyze levels of the following hormones secreted by your adrenal glands and thyroid: cortisol (which controls stress), ACTH, FT4, FT3, and total thyroxine.[10]\n\nTwo additional tests that you or a health professional may administer for adrenal fatigue are the iris contraction test and postural low blood pressure test.[11]\n\nThe iris contraction test measures how long the iris can contract in response to repeated exposure to dark light. Go into the dark bathroom and allow your pupils to adjust to the lack of light, then shine the light from a penlight or flashlight into your eye. You will notice the pupil contract (or get smaller); however, someone with adrenal fatigue’s irises will not be remain contracted for a prolonged period of time, and after about 30 seconds they will begin to dilate, despite shining the light on them.[12]\n\nPostural low blood pressure measures how quickly blood pressure rises when a person stands up. Someone suffering from adrenal fatigue will see no change in their blood pressure or even a slight fall, which is also called orthostatic hypotension.[13]\n\nTo test this, lie down for five minutes and have someone measure your blood pressure. Then stand up and, after one to three minutes, have the person take another reading. Not the change, if any, in your blood pressure readings.",
                "Learn about treatment options and recovery from adrenal dysfunction. Once you have a diagnosis for adrenal dysfunction, talk to your health professional about your treatment options and the recovery time. If you’ve diagnosed yourself, you may want to do some additional research on how to treat the syndrome.\n\n\nThe treatment options for adrenal fatigue range from changing diet and exercise, to reducing stress, and taking herbal or hormonal supplements.\nEstimates for the recovery period from adrenal fatigue range from about six to about eighteen months. Some individuals may need less time, while others need more, depending of the severity of the syndrome.[14]\n\nThere are some adrenal fatigue treatment programs online including Dr. Wilson’s Adrenal Fatigue Supplement Program.",
                "Consult your doctor. Before you start any treatment program for adrenal fatigue, consult with your doctor. Talking to your doctor will help ensure that your treatment plan will not harm your health.",
                "Adjusting your diet. Making some simple changes to your diet can optimize your health and help combat the symptoms of adrenal fatigue. From eating bone broth to avoiding caffeine, these suggestions will help you to recover faster.\n\n\nAvoid foods to which you are sensitive or allergic. These foods prevent the body absorbing vital nutrients and cause inflammation that can spur a host of problems including sleep disorders.[15]\n\nEat a healthy breakfast to get your body off on the right food and help stabilize your blood sugar and keep your body from stressing because it doesn’t have enough sustenance to function.[16] Good food choices for breakfast include steel cut oats with fruit, Greek yogurt, eggs, and whole wheat toast.\nEat less sugar to help control your cortisol levels. Cortisol regulates excess sugar so consuming less means that you’re less likely to overstimulate your adrenal glands. Avoid foods like cookies, cakes, and fruit juices.[17]\n\nAvoid caffeine, which stimulates your adrenal glands to produce adrenaline and cortisol, which put your body into a state of stress.[18]\n\nTry eating superfoods such as bone broth and seaweed, which are very high in nutrients and can reduce inflammation.[19]",
                "Add a gentle exercise regimen. Since many people with adrenal fatigue are in pain or are simply too tired to do vigorous exercise, adding a gentle exercise program to your treatment plan can help alleviate the symptoms of adrenal fatigue. Activities such as walking or swimming will also decrease stress, which in turn helps stabilize your cortisol levels.[20]\n\nSome examples of good exercise options are walking, swimming, yoga, and tai chi.\nIf you are not suffering from severe adrenal fatigue, you can jog or run, or even lift light weights.[21]\n\nAn added benefit of exercise is that it will help you sleep better.[22]",
                "Decrease the stress in your life. One of the underlying causes of adrenal fatigue is stress and its related hormone of cortisol. Reducing the stress in your life through activities such as meditation and unplugging from electronics will help your body recover from adrenal fatigue.\n\n\nTry meditation and pranayama, or deep breathing. These exercises help reduce stress and normalize our the levels of the hormones adrenaline and cortisol.[23] These activities aid circulation and toxin elimination as well as increasing our energy levels through oxygen saturation.[24]\n\nIn today’s world, we are inundated with emails, text messages, and other forms of ambient knowledge. Unplugging from your electronic devices is another good way to help decrease your stress levels.\nExercise will also help decrease stress and cortisol.",
                "Take medications and supplements. Although adrenal fatigue may cause a deficiency in hormones, it may also cause a deficiency in vital nutrients the body needs. Taking medications and supplements can help alleviate the symptoms of adrenal fatigue and put you on the path to recovery.\n\n\nKnow that any medications and supplements should be taken only after consulting with a health care professional so that you do not endanger your health.",
                "Consider taking a multivitamin to get needed nutrients. People with adrenal fatigue are often lacking in several vitamins and minerals. Consider taking a multivitamin or specific vitamins to help replenish the levels in your blood.[25]\n\nYou may want to take the following vitamin supplements if you do not want to take a multivitamin: Vitamins B5, B6, and B12.[26] These specific B vitamins are important role to cell metabolism and will boost your energy level.[27]\n\nAlthough there are studies on the benefits of the B vitamins with certain conditions, there is no evidence to support that taking the B vitamins will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.[28]\n\nVitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is directly involved in the production of cortisol in your adrenal glands as well as in the recovery of your adrenals. Vitamin C will also help boost your immunity.[29]\n\nAlthough there are studies on the benefits of Vitamin C for the adrenal glands, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.[30]\n\nMagnesium will help maintain energy flow and fight symptoms like fatigue and depression. Start with 400mg because taking too much magnesium can cause digestive problems.[31]\n\nOne older study examines the relationship between adrenal insufficiency and magnesium.[32] However, there is no direct evidence that taking the supplement will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.[33]",
                "Consider taking herbal supplements as a natural alternative to vitamins. There are also several herbal supplement you can take that might help adrenal fatigue, including licorice root, Siberian ginseng, Rhodiola Rosea, and Maca root.[34]\n\nRemember the herbal supplements are unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, so their claims are often not proven with research.\nLicorice root is used to stimulate hormone production, maintain energy levels and increase endurance by helping your cortisol to circulate in your system for a longer period of time. Licorice root can elevate blood pressure, so avoid it if you have high blood pressure.[35]\n\nAlthough there are studies on the medical uses of licorice root, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue.[36]\n\nSiberian ginseng is used to improve stamina and mental awareness, and boost energy levels. Siberian ginseng can elevate blood pressure, so avoid it if you have high blood pressure.[37]\n\nAlthough there are a few studies on the medical uses of Siberian ginseng, including for stamina and mental awareness, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate your adrenal fatigue. In addition, the results of these studies was often contradictory.[38]\n\nRhodiola rosea can help with muscle tension, poor circulation, depression, and fatigue by increasing circulation and cortisol production.[39]\n\nAlthough there are studies on the medical uses of Rhodiola for depression, stress, and fatigue, there is no direct evidence that it will alleviate adrenal fatigue.[40]\n\nMaca root can help cortisol blood sugar regulation as well as aiding your body to get the most out of its low levels of hormones.[41]\n\nThere isn’t enough research or information to know how it might work, or if it will alleviate adrenal fatigue.[42]",
                "Consider hormone replacement. Hormone replacement is another option to help treat adrenal fatigue. You’ll need a prescription from your health care professional for any hormones you take, including cortisol, DHEA, pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and adrenal extract.[43]\n\nYou’ll have to consult with your doctor if you are considering hormone replacement because this type of therapy requires prescription medication.\nYour doctor will likely prescribe a blood test to establish your baseline hormone levels in order to best figure out which hormone replacements you should take.[44]\n\nAlthough hormone replacement may help with adrenal fatigue, there is almost no research on it as a therapy for the syndrome. It is thus important that if you choose this method, that you do it only under a doctor’s supervision.[45]\n\nCortisol has been long used to treat for Addison’s Disease, or adrenal insufficiency.[46] But cortisol can have significant side effects including obesity, muscle weakness, diabetes, and thin skin, so use with care.[47] Because of these side effects, most doctors are reluctant to prescribe corticosteroids for a long period of time.\nTaking DHEA can reinvigorate sex drive and some of the other symptoms of well-being that adrenal fatigue disrupts. If you are taking DHEA, get levels of the hormone tested regularly so that you’re not getting too much.[48]\n\nPregnenolone is directly involved with sex and stress hormones and taking it may help reduce the symptoms of adrenal fatigue.[49]\n\nTestosterone can help improve symptoms of adrenal fatigue related to general well-being, libido, endurance, and mood. It may also improve overall quality of life.[50]\n\nProgesterone may help with lower energy levels, irritability and depression, as well as weight gain.[51]\n\nAdrenal glandular extracts may help with fatigue and stress. If you decide to take this hormone replacement, make sure that it comes from a quality, organic source.[52]"

        "How to Afford Dental Implants": {
            "intro": "The cost of dental implants can be outrageous. The benefits of implants over other dental care, however, can be significant because they can entirely replace your missing teeth while leaving the other teeth intact. If you are interested in dental implants, try these options before ruling them out completely.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine what portion of the cost, if any, your insurance will cover. Dental insurance doesn't often cover a large percentage of dental procedure costs, but some plans do cover a fraction of the overall cost. Although it may not be a lot, every penny the insurance company will pay will help in the long run.\n\n\nCall your insurance company to discuss the best way of paying for your dental implants.\nIt is important to determine if going to an in-network provider will affect the amount the insurance company will cover.",
                "Discuss your options with your dentist. Let your dentist know if the cost of the dental implants is unattainable for you. Some dental offices that do implants may consider offering you a payment plan that would make the implants more affordable. Approach the payment office at your dentist and see if they allow such plans.[1]\n\nScheduling multiple implants at once is recommended to promote the healing process and for improving benefits for a long term result. Scheduling multiple implants at once might also help you save on the cost of office visits, anesthesia, and other charges.\nAsking your dentist for a temporary solution until you can afford to get the implants is also a possibility.",
                "Ask your dentist if they discount multiple implants. Some dental offices have packages available to help make implants more affordable for their patients. Inquire if they have packages available, or if they provide discounts with multiple implants.",
                "Find a dentist that performs all the steps. Dental implants involve many steps, and many times require both a surgeon and a dentist. If you can find a dentist who performs both the surgical and restorative work, you may save money, and there is one person who takes all the responsibility for the entire procedure, which is really important. You also save time this way because the provider is able to combine the visits.",
                "Comparison shop. Before deciding, call around to get quotes from different dentists. You want to make sure you are getting the best quality care for the best price. Don't stop at dentists, though; periodontists and oral surgeons also offer dental implants. Make sure you have looked at all your available options.\n\n\nWiden the net for where you get your implants. If you live in a large city, try finding a quality, recommended dentist in a suburb. Many times, dentists in smaller areas will charge less than those in large cities.\nLook for new practices. Newly opened practices may charge less as they build their reputation and client lists. Be sure to check references, like where they went to school and where they worked previously, their type of experience and methods they use, along with reviews from people in the community who have been to the new practice.",
                "Try a dental implant center. A dental implant center specializes in this kind of oral surgery. The center might charge less because dental implants are what they do on a regular basis, while your dentist might charge more because it is a special surgery. These centers also usually strive to provide lower treatment cost by having one surgical team to work on your mouth, instead of different specialists who charge separate fees.",
                "Look into dental schools. Many college and universities have dental schools that provide dental care at reduced costs. Most of these dental schools have recently graduated students working alongside experienced dentists and professors.[2] They may even have better medical equipment, such as computers that they use for guided surgery.",
                "Finance your implants. Try health care financing, like CareCredit or Springstone.[3] Some companies offer special financing for health care related costs at no interest or low, fixed interest rates. Usually these financing option require decent credit scores. If your credit score is low, you can get one or two cosigners on the application to get approved.",
                "Look into low-income resources. Some organizations offer aid to low-income households who need dental care. Some non-profits and dental associations provide aid to certain demographics, such as people with disabilities, women and children, and others.\n\n\nThe American Dental Association provides a list by state of local dental societies that can help you find affordable payment options.[4]",
                "Get a dental plan. If your insurance doesn't pay for implants, there are dental insurance alternative plans that offer implant coverage. These plans usually require you to use dentists in their network.",
                "Look into dental tourism. Dental tourism has become a popular method for high priced dental work. Dental implants are cheaper in other countries, such as Mexico, Hungary, Italy, Costa Rica, and many Asian countries. Sometimes, the same dental implants can cost half of the price it would in the US.\n\n\nDental tourism should be practiced with caution. Different government health standards means that not every dentist will be equal. Research the regulations, licensing standards, procedures, and the dental office carefully before getting work done. Get an international dental referral if at all possible.\nAlso, you need to make sure that the implant you get is a high quality one because there are many companies on the market and dental implants have also started to be manufactured in China. Another risk you need to consider is that you may end up spending more money if the treatment doesn't go as planned and complications appear.",
                "Consider making dental implants a top priority. If dental implants are something you really want and need, consider making that a top priority. Instead of buying a new car or taking a vacation, use that money to help pay for your dental health.",
                "Start saving. Once you have determined how much it will cost to get dental implants, start setting aside a designated amount each week or month until you save the desired amount. Saving in small increments may help the overall cost seem less overwhelming. Calculate how long it will take to save up enough money for your dental implants and schedule your appointment for that time.",
                "Take it one step at a time. Don't feel like you need to have all of the dental work done at the same time. If you can only afford to have the teeth extracted at this time, then stop there until you can afford the rest. Dental work is often done in stages, so it is feasible that you may need to pay for one stage at a time until you have completed the process. Even if it takes an extended amount of time, you won't be burdened with the whole bill at once.\n\n\nDental implants take time to heal in the bone and this process takes at least four to six months. This means you have plenty of time to gather the money for the prosthetic part.",
                "Think about a funding campaign. If you are in serious need of dental implants but still can't raise the money, think about starting a campaign to raise the money. Websites such as Indiegogo and GoFundMe allow you to raise money for health care. After setting up the account, you can share via social media so friends and family members can donate if they are willing."

        "How to Hand Feed a Hermit Crab": {
            "intro": "Hermit crabs are a popular pet, due to their ease of care and the fun that comes with picking colorful shell homes for them to live in. Feeding hermit crabs by hand might seem tricky, but if you follow certain procedures, you will find it is easier than you think!",
            "steps": [
                "Pick up your crab gently by his shell. Pick up your crab with your dominant hand and hold him gently but securely. Allow your crab to relax, and gently try to coax him out of his shell a bit. He might stay hidden in his shell if he is scared, so give him some time to adjust.[1]\n\nNever pick your crab up by his front, or anywhere near his claws, as you might run the risk of getting pinched.[2]\n\nThis process might take time, especially if you’ve never tried it before. If your crab hides in his shell when you hold him, you may need to get him used to being held a bit more before you can hand feed him.",
                "Use a special feeding spoon. You can purchase one online from a specialty store, or you can make one yourself. Simply use something thin and at least a few inches long, like the stem of a pen cap. Put a tiny piece of food on the end of the stem.[3]\n\nDon’t use anything with a sharp point on the end. Since you’ll be using this object like a spoon, you won’t want to put anything near the crab’s mouth that could potentially poke or hurt him.",
                "Place the food by the crab’s antennae. These are the long, thread-like parts that come out of his head, near his eyes. He uses these parts to sense his surroundings, and also to taste his food. Place the food you want to feed him near his antennae so he can taste it and decide if he likes it and wants it.[4]\n\nThe crab will decide if he wants the food or not, and if he does, he will use his small claw and maxillipeds, or mouth parts, to pick apart the food and push it into his mouth in tiny bites.",
                "Don’t force the crab to eat. If you try to feed your crab and he seems to have no interest in eating, don’t force it. Set him down back in his home and let him be for a while. You can always try again later when he might be more hungry, or even try again with a different food that might be more appealing to him.[5]\n\nIf you get the hang of hand feeding your hermit crab, he might ultimately become easier to handle and more willing to be held, as he will associate being held with getting yummy food and treats.[6]",
                "Avoid holding your crab over hard floors or surfaces. If you have children, especially, avoid letting them hold the crab over tile or wood floors. Dropping a crab from that distance onto a hard surface can ultimately be fatal for the crab, as it could damage or rupture his tiny internal organs.[7]",
                "Wash your hands before and after handling your crab. Even though hermit crabs are not carriers of diseases like many invertebrates, it’s still important to keep your hands clean, both for yourself and the safety of your crab.[8]\n\nIf you have chemicals on your hands, even those from certain lotions or household cleaning products, you might transfer these things to your crab when you handle him. Wash your hands prior to handling him to avoid this.",
                "Make your own hermit crab food. There are plenty of things you probably already have around the house that are safe and enjoyable for your hermit crab to eat. Many fruits and vegetables are great for feeding to your crab.[9]\n\nUse a food processor or blender to grind up your crab’s food into tiny pieces. This way, he will be better able to eat it when you give it to him.",
                "Avoid foods that are toxic to hermit crabs. Household ingredients like onion and garlic should be avoided, as well as things like catnip, chocolate, dill, eucalyptus, rosemary, and thyme. Before feeding anything to your crab, do a search to make sure it is safe.",
                "Incorporate meat into your hermit crab’s diet. Hermit crabs are omnivores, so it’s important to balance their intake of vegetation and meat. All kinds of crustaceans, including lobster, shrimp, and other crabs, are great sources of meat.",
                "Buy a pre-packaged hermit crab food. At the local pet store, or at the place you bought your crab, there is likely to be a selection of crab food that you can buy already made, blended, and packaged. You can always purchase this kind of food to feed your crab with.\n\n\nBe mindful of preservatives in this kind of food. Preservatives are not good for crabs, so if you can, try to choose a food that doesn’t have any. Check the ingredients label for things like Ethoxyquin, copper sulfate, or BHT (butylhydroxytoluene). These can be toxic to your crab.[10]\n\nThese commercially made foods can also become boring and bland for your crab to eat day after day. If you do choose to purchase and use this kind of food, try mixing in other things once in awhile to keep your crab interested.",
                "Offer a variety of foods and treats. You can buy many different kinds of pre-made treats at your local pet supply or grocery store, including freeze-dried plankton and shrimp, fish food flakes, and even seaweed. Giving your crab treats will help keep his diet varied.[11]\n\nA varied diet is important for hermit crabs. You don’t really need to worry about them overeating or being overfed, due to the way their metabolisms function. They’re more likely to eat too little, especially if their food choices aren’t enticing or interesting. Changing up their food each day will help keep your crab interested in eating.[12]",
                "Learn what your crab likes. Just like any other pet, your crab will like certain foods while disliking others. The way to learn what he does and does not like is by trial and error. See what foods he responds to the best, and which foods he turns away from.[13]\n\nEven though they do have specific tastes, hermit crabs are not very picky eaters. You will be more likely to see your crab turn away from food if he is bored by it rather than because he doesn’t like it at all."

        "How to Improve Prostate Health": {
            "intro": "The prostate is a small gland found in men, near their bladders. Many men experience prostate problems, and as they get older it is important to watch for signs of prostate cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, one in every seven men is diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. In 2015, 27,540 deaths were projected to occur due to prostate cancer.[1] However, there are a number of preventive measures that a man can take to reduce his risk of developing prostate cancer, including important dietary and lifestyle changes and becoming aware of his family history.",
            "steps": [
                "Eat whole grains and more fruits and vegetables. Choose whole-grain bread and pasta over white bread and pasta. Make sure to get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every single day. Include produce high in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant, such as red peppers and tomatoes. Lycopene is what makes fruit and vegetables red, and has been proven as a cancer-fighting ingredient. In general, the deeper and brighter the color of your produce, the better.[2]\n\nThere are currently no guidelines as the amount of lycopene you should try to get each day. However, research indicates that for lycopene to make any difference, you would need to eat lycopene-foods all day to get the amounts needed.[3]\n\nCruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy and kale are also good defenses against the development of cancer. Some controlled studies have found a link between increased ingestion of cruciferous vegetables and reduced risk of prostate cancer, although the evidence is merely associative at this point.[4]",
                "Be more selective in your consumption of protein. Cut back on how much red meat you eat, including beef, pork, lamb and goat. It's also a good idea to limit your consumption of processed meats, like sandwich meat and hot dogs.[5]\n\nInstead of red meat, eat fish with high levels of omega-3 acids, including salmon and tuna. These foods will help your prostate as well as your heart and immune system. The research about the relationship between dietary fish intake and prostate cancer prevention is largely based on correlative data and namely, the fact that the Japanese have so few cases of prostate cancer and eat large amounts of fish. Whether there is a causal relationship is still being debated.[6]\n\nBeans, skinless poultry, and eggs are also healthy options for protein.",
                "Increase the amount of soy in your diet. The properties of soy, which is found in many vegetarian dishes, fight cancer. Sources of soy include tofu, soy nuts, soy flour and soy powders. Swapping cow's milk for soy milk in your cereal or coffee is one way to get more soy into your diet.[7]\n\nNote that recent research has found soy beans and some other specific products, such as tofu, to be preventive in prostate cancer. However, this cannot be extrapolated to all soy products, including milk. There are also no current anecdotal or evidence-based guidelines on the amount of soy you should try to incorporate into your diet.[8]",
                "Limit your alcohol, caffeine, and sugar intake. Though you don't need to entirely cut out caffeine from your diet, try to limit how much you ingest. For example, limit yourself to one to two 4-ounce cups of coffee per day. The same goes for alcohol; try to view it as a treat and stick to a couple of small glasses a week.[9]\n\nAvoid sugary (sometimes also caffeinated) drinks like sodas and fruit juices. These have nearly zero nutritional benefit.",
                "Limit your salt intake. The best way to cut back on how much sodium you consume is to eat fresh produce, dairy, and meats and avoid packaged, canned, and frozen foods. Salt is often used as a preservative and is thus present in large amounts in pre-packaged foods.[10]\n\nWhen shopping, stick to the outer perimeter of the grocery store as much as possible. This is where most of the fresh food is located, while cartons, cans, and other packages tend to be isolated in the center aisles.\nTake the time to read and compare food labels. Most food labels are now required to state how much sodium is in a product and what percentage it makes up of your daily recommended intake of sodium.\nThe American Heart Association recommends that Americans consume less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.[11]",
                "Keep good fats and get rid of bad fats. Limit your consumption of saturated fats from animal and dairy products and instead switch to healthy fats, like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. Animal products high in fat, such as meat, butter, and lard, have been associated with an increase risk of prostate cancer.[12][13]\n\nAvoid fast food and most processed foods. These often contain partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are extremely unhealthy.",
                "Take supplements. Cancer research has emphasized the importance of getting your nutrients from food instead of vitamin supplements whenever possible.[14] However, there may be cases where a supplement is a better option for you. Be sure to discuss any supplements you are taking or thinking about taking with your physician.\n\n\nTake zinc supplements. Most men do not get enough zinc in their diets, and supplements can help keep your prostate healthy. Research has demonstrated that zinc deficiencies can lead to enlarged prostates and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. You can take 50 to 100 (or even up to 200) milligrams of zinc per day in tablet form to reduce an enlarged prostate.[15]\n\nTry taking saw palmetto berry, made from the berries of the Saw Palmetto plant. This supplement has received mixed reviews from users and the medical field, so talk to your doctor before you try it. Some research has suggested that it may assist in the cytotoxicity (cell death) of human prostate cancer cells.[16]\n\nNote that some research has suggested that taking certain supplements, such as vitamin E, or folic acid (a B vitamin) may even increase your risk of prostate cancer. Other studies has demonstrated that taking many (i.e., more than 7) supplements, even those marked for prostate cancer, may increase the risk of developing advanced prostate cancer.[17]",
                "Don't smoke. Although the relationship of prostate cancer and smoking has been long debated, tobacco use is believed to cause oxidative damage via free radicals to the body's cells, thus making the link between cancer and smoking plausible. In a meta-analysis of 24 studies, researchers found that cigarette smoking was in fact a risk for prostate cancer.[18][19]",
                "Maintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight, get yourself on a diet and exercise plan that will get you into a healthy range. Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.[20]\n\nReduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. This is the secret to weight loss.[21]\n\nWatch portion sizes and make a concerted effort to eat slowly, savor and chew your food and stop eating when you are full. Remember that you just need to feel satiated, not stuffed to the brim.[22]",
                "Exercise regularly. Regular activity is not only good for reducing your risk of certain types of cancers, but also other potential health problems, including depression, heart disease and stroke. Though a causal relationship between exercise to prostate health remains unconfirmed, the studies that have been conducted to date suggest that exercise is beneficial in keeping your prostate healthy. [23][24]\n\nYou should aim for 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise several days a week. However, even low to moderate exercising, like brisk walking, is beneficial for prostate health. If you're new to exercising, start slowly by walking to work, using the stairs instead of the elevator and going on nightly walks. Build up to more intense workouts involving aerobic exercise, like cycling, swimming, or running.[25]",
                "Perform Kegel exercises. Kegel exercises are performed by contracting the muscles of your pelvic floor (as if you were attempting to stop the flow of urine), holding them for a brief period, and then releasing them. Doing these exercises regularly will help strengthen and tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor. You can do Kegel exercises anywhere because they don't require any special equipment!\n\n\nTighten the muscles around your scrotum and anus for a few seconds, then release. Do this exercise in 10 repetitions three to four times a day to improve your prostate health. Try to build up to 10-second holds.\nYou can also do Kegel exercises by lying on your back with your pelvis in the air and clenching your buttocks. Hold for 30 seconds, then release. Do this for five minute intervals three times a day.",
                "Ejaculate often. Although for a long time, researchers believed that frequent ejaculation during sex, masturbation, or even a dream increased men's risk of developing prostate cancer, newer research is suggesting in fact, that frequent ejaculation may actually protect the prostate. Researchers suggest that ejaculation may help to flush out carcinogens in the prostate glands as well as help fluids in the prostate turn over more quickly to reduce cancer risk. In addition, regular ejaculation may also help to reduce psychological tension, which can slow the growth of cancer cells.[26]\n\nThat said, this research is still in its early stages and researchers have said that it's too soon to yet make a formal recommendation on men's sexual habits. It's unclear, for example, how often a man should ejaculate to see these benefits. These researchers do suspect, however, that ejaculation frequency accompanies other indicators of a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet and regular exercise.[27]",
                "Be aware of your family history. Having immediate male family members (such as a father or brother) with prostate cancer significantly increase your risk of developing it yourself. In fact, the risk is more than doubled! It's essential that you notify your doctor of any family history of prostate cancer so you can work together to build a comprehensive preventive program.[28]\n\nNote that the risk is high for men with a brother diagnosed with prostate cancer than a father. In addition, the risk is increased for those men who have multiple relatives with prostate cancer, especially if those relatives were diagnosed at a young age (e.g., before 40).[29]\n\nAsk your doctor to test to see if you have mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which may increase your chances of prostate cancer.[30][31]",
                "Know the symptoms of a potential prostate problem. These include erectile dysfunction, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate or have sex, pain in the hips or low back, or always feeling like you need to urinate.[32]\n\nHowever, prostate cancer is often asymptomatic, at least until it has spread to affect other parts of the body, such as the bones. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer rarely report the above symptoms of incontinence, blood in the urine, impotence, etc.",
                "See your doctor regularly. The American Cancer Society recommends getting screened for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 (or age 45 if you have any risk factors for prostate cancer). Screening involves the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a substance made by both the normal and cancer the cells in your prostate that is found in a small amount in the blood. Most men have PSA levels of 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood, and the higher the PSA leve, the higher the chance of cancer. The gap between screenings depends on the results of this test. Men who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL need retesting every 2 years, whereas men with higher PSA levels should be tested annually.[33]\n\nA digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be included in the screening. In this exam, a clinician will feel for a nodule on the back side of the prostate.[34]\n\nNeither the PSA nor the DRE is conclusive. You will likely need a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer.[35]\n\nAt present, the American Cancer Society recommends that men should make an informed decision about prostate screening after detailed discussion with their primary care physicians. Screening can help locate cancers early, but there is no conclusive research as to whether screening actually saves lives. That said, catching the cancer earlier increases the chance that it can be treated successfully.[36]"

        "How to Train Your Dog to Use a Dog Door": {
            "intro": "Having a dog door can be great for dog’s and their owners because they give the dog a bit more freedom to go in and out of the house as they please and owners won’t have to wake up early in the morning to take the dog for a morning walk. However, dogs aren’t always able to figure out how to use a dog door on their own, and may even be afraid of it at first. Take steps to train your dog to use the door and they’ll be happy to use it in no time.",
            "steps": [
                "Schedule training session appropriately. It is important to limit your dog’s training to short spans of time when you can give your dog your undivided attention. Choose a time of day where you won’t be distracted by other tasks, and when your dog is alert and active.[1]\n\nMake sure to have your dog’s favorite treats easily accessible as you will want to be able to give them the treat immediately after performing the correct behavior.\nLimit training sessions to ten minutes at a time. This will help both you and your dog avoid becoming frustrated. You can do more than one session in a day, but be sure to have several hours “rest” in between each session, and don’t push your dog’s attention by going over ten minutes of training.",
                "Decide whether your dog would rather go in or out. Does your dog love to be lazy and lay inside on the couch, or would they rather be outside running around in the yard? When training your dog, you’ll want them to have as much incentive as possible to go through the door. If your dog loves being outside do your training sessions so that the dog is inside and you are outside.[2]\n\nPractice with your dog going both in and out of the door, but if your dog is not using the door at all, start with getting your dog to go the place they enjoy being most.",
                "Get some treats with a strong scent. Choose a treat that has a strong enough smell so that they will be able to smell the treats from a few feet away. Put a few of the treats in your hand and close your fist tightly. Let the dog smell and lick your hand so that they know you have them.[3]\n\nYou will use these treats as a reward for going all the way through the dog door. It is important to reward your dog for any progress, though. In the case that your dog comes to or part way through the door, use lots of verbal encouragement, but don’t give the dog the treat.",
                "Stand on the opposite side of the door as your dog. Let your dog see you going through the door. This doesn’t mean you need to crawl through the dog door yourself, but your dog should be fully aware that you are on the other side of the door.[4]\n\nFor example, if your dog door is installed in the door, then let your dog see you exit through that door (the human door). If your dog’s door is installed in a normal wall, make sure your dog sees you leaving.",
                "Lift the flap all the way up. If your dog door is the type that requires a chip, you will have to disable it for training. Lift the flap as far open as it will go.[5]\n\nIn the initial training stage it is important that the flap doesn’t hit your dog on their way in or out. For some dogs this can be traumatic and will make them afraid of the door.",
                "Call your dog. Make sure you use a very happy and enthusiastic voice. Act as though you have never been more excited to see your dog, and that you really want them to come to you.[6]\n\nUsing an enthusiastic voice will excite your dog and make them want to come to you.",
                "Reward them. It is important to reward the dog with lots of verbal encouragement as they come toward and through the door, even if they don’t go all the way through. If your dog does make it all the way through you should celebrate with them as though it’s the best thing that ever happened, and be sure to give them a treat.[7]\n\nOffer them lots of affection and use a very happy tone of voice. This will show them that they did the right thing, and that going through the dog door is not off-limits.\nIf your dog is skittish you should use a happy voice and lots of affection, but don’t yell as this may scare them. Try to adapt the reward to your dog’s personality. If your dog is easily frightened then keep a happy, but soft voice.",
                "Go to the other side of the door. Now you can repeat the process, but this time with you on the opposite side from where you started. This way, your dog will get used to going both ways.[8]\n\nIf your dog is still pretty frightened of the door you can stay on the same side as you started, which means that your dog is coming through the door to their favorite place (inside or outside) and to their favorite person (you).",
                "Hold the flap a bit lower. Once your dog seems comfortable with going through the dog door with the flap completely open, have them do the same thing; but this time, hold the flap so it is only halfway open. This will mean that the flap touches your dog.[9]\n\nThis may be a bit more frightening for your dog so remember to use lots and lots of encouragement, even if they don’t make it all the way through.\nRemember not to push your dog too hard. If you try lowering the flap, but your dog is too scared to come through, end the session and begin again in a few hours (or the next day) but with the flap a bit more open.",
                "Lower the flap more and more. As the training continues and your dog becomes more comfortable with the flap touching them, you can lower it a little more each time. Keep the training positive and upbeat. Eventually your dog will go through the flap without you holding it at all.[10]\n\nTake it slow, though. It is important to understand that training may take weeks or months for some dogs. If you notice that your dog is becoming fearful at any point, stop the training and start again with the flap a bit higher (or all the way up). It may take patience, but eventually they will learn that the door is a good thing.",
                "Have the dog use the flap without calling. Throughout the training, you have been using your calls as a signal to come through the door. Once your dog seems completely comfortable with going through the flap unassisted, you can teach them that it is OK to go through the flap without you.[11]\n\nTo do this, put your dog on one side of the door and go to the other side without calling them. Do something that you know your dog enjoys. Go outside and play (with kids if you have them). Run around the yard and make happy noises that will signal to the dog that they are missing out on something fun. If they come out the door on their own, celebrate with them. Give them lots of affection and play with their favorite toy with them.",
                "Decide whether or not your dog’s personality is right for this method. This method should only be used by dogs who aren’t afraid of the door, but simply haven’t figured out how to use the door. If you try this method and your dog exhibits any fear, then try a different method.[12]\n\nThis method probably won’t work well for a large dog that you can’t easily pick up and place through the door using two hands.",
                "Choose the right time to train your dog. When training your dog, choose a time where your dog is active and alert and where you won’t be distracted or disturbed by other things going on in the house.[13]\n\nLimit the training session to ten minutes at a time to avoid frustration. If you train for too long both you and your dog might become frustrated, which will cause the dog to associate the door with negative feelings. By limiting sessions to ten minutes at a time, you improve your chances for success.\nYou can train more than once a day if you like, but be sure to have several hours “rest” in between each session.",
                "Pick your dog up. Using a soft, soothing voice pick your dog up using both hands. You don’t want your dog to get the idea that something bad is going to happen or that they have done something wrong. Make sure that it is clear that everything is alright.[14]\n\nHold your hands gently but firmly around your dog’s ribcage so that they feel secure.",
                "Place your dog gently through the door. To do this, you will need to press your dog’s face gently up against the door and push him through. Do this gently and slowly so that your dog won’t become frightened.[15]\n\nDo this gently. Don’t jam your dog through the door as you will probably scare them, and you might even injure them.",
                "Praise your dog. Once your dog is through the door, get excited. Show the dog that you are happy that they went through the door, and give them lots of affection and a treat (if you want).[16]\n\nIf your dog seemed fearful or agitated by the door, stop the training and try another method.",
                "Repeat this process a few times. As long as your dog seems comfortable, you can continue this type of training over the course of a few days. Each time you place your dog through the door, be sure to celebrate the event with lots of attention.[17]\n\nYou can put the dog through the door more than once in a training session, but remember to limit the session to 10 minutes.",
                "Hold your dog in front of the door. Once you have put your dog through the door several times, try holding the dog around the ribcage a few inches from the door. The dog should use his own nose to push his way through the door.[18]\n\nIf the dog doesn’t seem to understand, keep placing the dog through on your own. Eventually, they will get the hang of it.\nDon’t forget to give your dog lots of praise when they push themselves through the door.",
                "Call the dog back through the door. Once your dog has learned how to push their way through the door, stand on the other side and call your dog. If they come through on their own, give them lots of praise and a treat.\n\n\nIf they don’t come back through, pick them up and hold them in front of the door again so they can push their way through.[19]",
                "Make sure the door is big enough that your dog can fit easily. The door should be at least 2 inches (5.5 cm) above the top of your dogs shoulders to be tall enough for them. Additionally, the door must be at least 2 inches (5.5 cm) wider than the widest part of your dogs body (usually the shoulders or hips).[20]\n\nWhen installing your dog’s door, be sure to consider that they may gain weight as they age. Though you want to ensure that your dog stays at a healthy weight, if they are on the thin side at the moment, consider that they may get a bit wider in old age.\nIf your dog is a puppy when you install the door, be sure to think about the fact that they will grow. In the case of some breeds, your puppy will grow significantly. When installing the door, find out how big the dog could possibly get and install a door that will be big enough for a full-grown dog of that size.",
                "Consider the possibility of intruders. This doesn’t necessarily refer to people, though if your dog door is big enough, burglars could potentially enter through an unsecured dog door. You should also think about potential animals in your area that might enter through the dog’s door. For example, if you live in an area where there are many raccoons, they could sneak in through the door.\n\n\nIf you are worried about this issue, consider installing a plastic door that comes with a lock. This will allow you to manually lock and unlock the door when you need to. You could also consider an electronic door. These doors come with a chip that goes on your dogs collar, and will only open for an animal wearing the chip. Some doors even work with your pet’s microchip, and will open for your dog when he comes close to it.",
                "Make sure that your yard is a safe place for your dog. Dog doors should open to an area that will be safe for your dog. Usually, this will be your fenced-in yard. Before training your dog to use the door, take time to make sure that your yard will be safe for your dog.[21]\n\nFor example, make sure that your fence is high enough so that your dog cannot jump out. Some dogs can jump higher than you might think, so do some research into your dog’s breed to see how high they might be able to jump.",
                "Reinforce your fence, if necessary. If a dog can’t jump out, they may dig themselves out more easily. You can prevent this by lining your fence with large stones or by having your fence extend into the ground so that your dog would have to dig very deep in order to get out.\n\n\nBefore letting your dog in the yard unsupervised, be sure to spend time watching their behavior in the yard to help identify any areas in the fence where your dog might consider as a good play to jump over or dig under.",
                "Check for poisonous plants and chemicals in your yard. Some plants are toxic to dogs; for example, a weed known as foxtail grass can make your dog very sick if it get’s in their eyes or mouth. Other plants such as ferns, Aloe Vera, and Alocasia are all toxic to dogs. You can find a more complete lists of all plants toxic to dogs here\n\n\nPut away any pesticides or chemicals that are laying around. If you notice any bottles of weed killer, chemicals, or any substance that can be potentially harmful to your dog, find a safe place to store it. Don’t leave it laying around or your dog may get bored and play with it.\nIf you have treated your lawn with any pesticides or chemicals, check the label to see what it says about pets. If it doesn’t say anything, keep your dog off of the lawn for at least 24 hours after application and contact your veterinarian to see what they say.",
                "Pick up any small rocks, toys, or other debris that your dog could swallow. Dogs sometimes swallow rocks on accident, and these stones can get caught in their intestines. The same goes for any small items your dog could fit in his mouth, which they could swallow or choke on. Limit the things lying in your yard to toys that are safe for your dog.",
                "Make sure the yard will be a fun place for your dog. While you want your yard to be safe for your dog, you also want it to be fun so the dog doesn’t get bored and look for ways to escape. Make sure your dog has access to fresh water, shade to get out of a hot sun, and plenty of dog-friendly toys to play with.\n\n\nFor example, toys that are made of rubber and are free from strings or other pieces that might be chewed off and ingested are a good choice. Make sure that the toy is large enough so that your dog can chew on it or play with it, but can’t be swallowed.[22]\n\nIf you want to give your dog something soft to give them comfort while you are gone during the day, try wearing around a soft, old sweater for a few days. Then give this to your dog to have. It will provide them with something to carry around in their mouth, and will be comforting to them because it smells like you.",
                "Teach children that the dog door is not for them. If you have young children, it is important that you teach them that the dog door is only for the dog. A small child trying to squeeze through a dog door could get stuck and suffer from injuries. It could even prove fatal if the child gets stuck in the door and cannot breathe.[23]\n\nInstalling a dog door that can only be opened with a microchip or a chip on the dog’s collar may also help prevent this."

                "Find a local track or trail and practice on your own. Use this directory and talk to your instructor and fellow students about local tracks and trails to practice on. Some tracks have bikes you can rent, but for others you have to bring your own. Part 2 has information on how to buy a bike.\n\n\nPractice basic riding skills like using the front and back breaks, using the clutch, and navigating bumpy terrain. Work on riding in different conditions like rain and mud, and learn how to navigate whoops, dips, and jumps. Move up to more advanced skills like wheelies and power slides. Remember, practice makes perfect!",
                "Ride with a group! Make friends in your classes and at the tracks. The motocross community is a welcoming bunch, especially for beginners. Organize outings and ride together. Doing motocross with friends will be a much more enriching and fun experience.\n\n\nThere are plenty of motocross clubs out there. Go to a reputable search engine and search for 'motocross clubs near me'. If there is one, reach out to them about joining! They'll show you the ropes and give you people to ride with.\nTry to find people around your skill level to practice with. Have some playful competition with them!",
                "Go to a race with your new motocross friends. Make a day of it and enjoy the spectacle that is motocross. Take note of the riders' gear and technique. Learn the names and sponsors of the best racers. Above all else, have fun!",
                "Practice driving straight. Your dirt bike will feel \"wiggly\" at first. The little grooves in the loose dirt will drag your front wheel back and forth. That's natural. As you get to higher speeds, your front wheel will straighten out. Don't tense up. Get a feel for going straight.\n\n\nStart in a low gear and work your way up.\nAt faster speeds, make sure your back is at a 45 degree angle and your arms are at a 90 degree angle. Standing up will act as additional suspension, which will give you more control.",
                "Once you get comfortable, practice accelerating. Body position is key for this. When you accelerate, your body will naturally get pushed back. Remember to stay forward. Keep your butt in the natural indentation where the seat meets the gas tank. Your hips should be directly over the foot pegs.\n\n\nDon't fight the backward push by pulling on the handlebars. Instead, lean forward and press down on the foot pegs.",
                "When you brake, squeeze the gas tank with your legs to stay in position. The more force you press on the handlebars the less control you have. Use your legs to stay in the proper position.",
                "When turning, commit and stay in control. Stick your inside leg out and keep your outside elbow up. If you have to put your foot down to avoid crashing, do it. Keep pressure on the outside foot peg and keep your butt on the outside of the seat. This will give you more traction.\n\n\nRemember to brake and shift before you enter a turn. You want to concentrate fully on the corner and your line, not braking.\nIf your bike doesn't shift automatically, work on shifting quickly and in one motion. You should use the throttle, clutch, and shifter together, not separately.",
                "Navigate whoops and bumps by standing up. Again, your legs add extra suspension and control. Whoops are the most common place to crash, so take them cautiously. Go slow and steady to start. Keep your weight towards the back of the bike, and remember that your bike will get wobbly. The key is to ride through it.",
                "Find a motorcycle dealer. Whether or not you already have a bike, your next step should be to find a quality dealer. Go to a reputable search engine and search for \"motocross dealer near me.\" Comb through the results and find a motorcycle dealership that specializes in motocross and has a good reputation.\n\n\nDon't let them pressure you into buying anything. You're just talking about motocross. The dealer is there for you as a resource first and a salesperson second.\nBuild and maintain a relationship with your dealer.\nIf you don't like the first dealer or their shop, move on and find another. Not every dealer is right for you. They should be friendly, willing to help, and have a top-notch shop.",
                "Once you're ready, go to your dealer and buy a bike. This is your most important decision. Do some research on the different kinds of bikes. Talk to your dealer and a find a bike that fits your personal needs. These are the questions to consider when buying a bike:\n\n\nHow experienced are you? If you're just starting, you should probably go for a smaller, four-stroke bike.\nHow tall are you? Find a bike that suits your size. Especially if you're a beginner, you need a bike that's short enough to allow you to put both feet on the ground.\nHow old are you? If you're a teenager, you'll want a 85cc-250cc bike. Adults should get 250cc-500cc bikes. Note that cc stands for cubic centimeters. The more cubic centimeters, the more power the bike has.\nHow much time are you willing to put into maintenance? Different bikes require different amounts of care. Generally speaking, two stroke bikes take more maintenance but are easier to maintain as four stroke motors are more complex.\nHow much money are you willing to spend? Motocross is expensive. Bikes generally cost thousands of dollars. Used bikes cost significantly less. Find a bike that fits your budget. Remember that you have more expenses coming with other equipment and memberships.",
                "Buy the appropriate safety equipment. As the saying goes: dress for the crash, not the ride. In motocross, you will crash. Be prepared and get the right safety gear. This is the safety equipment you'll need:\n\n\nHelmet. This is the most important piece of gear. Your helmet should be snug, but not uncomfortable. A full-face helmet is the safest type. Don't skimp on your helmet.\nGoggles. Always wear goggles. Your primary concern here is comfort.\nBody armor. You'll need chest and back protectors to prevent impact injuries to your body.\nClothing. Long sleeve shirts are a requirement. Wear something thinner to stay cool. Jeans are fine to start with, but you should get racing pants eventually.\nBoots. You have to wear boots that cover the ankle. Make sure they're comfortable and broken in.\nGloves. Always wear a sturdy pair of motorcycle gloves.\nElbow and knee pads. These are optional but highly recommended, especially for beginners.",
                "Find a way to transport your new bike and gear. You'll need a way to move your bike from your home to wherever you ride. Your method of transportation depends on how many bikes you need to transport and what kind of transportation you already own.\n\n\nIf you have a pickup truck, you're set. Strap your bike or bikes down in your truck bed with tie-downs.\nIf you have a trailer, hitch it to your car and put your bike in the trailer.\nIf you don't have a truck or a trailer, and you don't want to buy one, the cheapest and safest option is to buy a dirt bike carrier. You can order one online or buy one from your dealer. This only works to transport one bike, however.",
                "Find out when your local track has races. Look on their website, ask around, and check the local bulletin board. Most events will have classes suited to every skill level.\n\n\nMost events will require you to have a membership. The American Motorcycle Association hosts the majority of motocross events, and it's a good idea to stick with AMA-sanctioned events. AMA membership will cost at least $50.\nMost races have an additional fee to enter.",
                "Sign up for the race. Register for the class that suits your skill level. Some events require online preregistration while others have you register on race day.\n\n\nAlong with registration, you will need to buy a pit pass to get in. This is usually an armband. You must have this on you at all times on race day, so don't lose it!",
                "On race day, get to the track well before your class' scheduled practice time. You will need plenty of time for registration, getting dressed, and doing maintenance on your bike. Most events have a rider's meeting, practice time, stagger starts for the smaller classes, qualifiers for the main events, and then the main event. Keep track of where they are in the event!\n\n\nWalk the track before you practice. Think about what line would be best. Then, use your practice time to test out different lines.\nRefuel after your practice time. Keeping your tank at a third full will save up to ten pounds of extra weight.\nStay hydrated throughout the day.\nFind people in your class and try to stay with or near them so you don't miss any deadlines.",
                "Bring everything you could need to the track. Bring your bike, all your safety gear, jerseys, a basic tool set, water, rain gear, lawn chairs, and snacks. You won't regret bringing too much. Races can make for long days.\n\n\nYour tool set should include tire irons, a patch kit, tire pump, tire gauge, chain lube, a plug wrench, extra spark plugs, extra air filters, duct tape, and WD 40.\nBring plenty of extra gas, too.",
                "Have fun and race hard! Stay positive and don't worry if you get nervous. Even seasoned motocross veterans get nervous on race day. It's rare to win in your first race. Be competitive, but remember at the end of the day, you wanted to get into motocross to have fun!"

        "wikiHow to Become a U.S. Defense Contractor": {
            "intro": "The United States Government employs thousands of individual and corporate defense contractors every year. The Department of Defense, the various branches of the military, and the companies these agencies contract with employ thousands of people as security personnel, IT specialists, analysts, administrators, scientists, doctors, accountants, etc. The government also contracts with both large and small businesses to provide services and supplies that are used in every facet of maintaining the country’s defense. Breaking into defense contracting requires going through a lot of red tape, and can be difficult at first, but if you are motivated and able to obtain a security clearance, there are many opportunities to be had in the defense industry.",
            "steps": [
                "Become a U.S. Citizen. Almost all U.S. defense contractor positions require applicants to be United States citizens. If you are not a native citizen, you can go through the naturalization process to obtain your citizenship, which involves taking an extensive test on English and Civics.[1]",
                "Be able to acquire security clearance. You cannot actually obtain a security clearance until you are employed in a government job, or have been sponsored by a company or agency who wishes to hire you. However, you should try to determine if you are eligible for clearance before you begin. If you have previously had a security clearance in the past, this is a good indicator that you will be able to obtain one again. The following are some of the factors that generally prevent a person from obtaining a security clearance:\n\n\nPast criminal convictions that lead to jail time of 1 year or more.\nCurrent use of illegal or controlled substances.\nA determination of mental incompetence by a DoD-approved mental health professional.\nA dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces.\nUnwillingness to surrender a foreign passport.\nSevere, repeated financial problems.\nIntentional false statements made in the application process.\nRepeated alcohol abuse.\nA pattern of criminal or conduct or rule violation.",
                "Be willing to relocate. Defense contractor jobs are available throughout the world, however, to have the best shot at obtaining the kind of position your are interested in, you should be willing to relocate.",
                "Talk with other defense contractors. The best way to learn the ins and outs of becoming a U.S. defense contractor is to talk with people who already have the kind of position you are hoping to land. These individuals can give you insider tips on how to locate jobs, red flags to look for on job listings, and perhaps most importantly, position-specific instructions on how to format your resume and complete your application in a way that gets you hired.",
                "Check on-line job listings. The Department of Defense maintains a job listing site for civilian employment opportunities with the DoD and all military branches. You can either go to the DoD’s website and click “Employment,” or use the main www.usajobs.gov portal and use the keyword “defense” to look for these jobs. Private companies looking to hire individuals into defense contractor positions usually advertise on major job search websites, like monster.com and indeed.com. Enter “defense contractor” into the search line to locate these positions.",
                "Fill out your application completely. Government jobs usually involve a notoriously detailed application process. Read the application thoroughly before beginning, and make sure to fill it out completely before submitting it. And be honest in your application; obtaining a defense contractor position will eventually require a thorough background check, and any errors or omissions in your application are likely to be exposed.[2]",
                "Be patient. The hiring process for government jobs moves much more slowly than it does in the private sector. You can expect it to take anywhere from several weeks to a few months to find out if your application made the first cut, and even longer to get all the way through the application and evaluation process. Remember that the payoff in job security, benefits, and salary if you get the job will eventually be worth the wait.[3]",
                "Cooperate fully with the security investigation process. If you become a finalist or are offered a position, you will need to complete a rigorous investigation process to obtain security clearance. You must comply with this process fully, answer all questions truthfully and completely, and provide all information that is requested quickly and accurately. It is unfortunate to get through a months-long application process only to lose out at the end over a mistake or omission, but it does happen.[4]",
                "Know that the United States Government wants to work with you! The U.S. Government doesn’t just work with major companies. The Department of Defense sets aside a substantial portion of its budget to contracting with small business. Small businesses owned by women, veterans, and minorities are given further advantages in the bid selection process. Working with the DoD can be a real boon for your small business!",
                "Do your homework. Working with the federal government requires understanding and following a lot of complicated rules and procedures. The U.S. Small Business Administration maintains a comprehensive guide for small business that wish to take on federal contracts.[5] The ACQ also maintains a helpful Guide to DOD Contracting Opportunities.It is important to study and understand these materials before seeking out federal contracts.\n\n\nThe materials noted above are admittedly dense, but know that the paperwork you will need to keep up with to seek and maintain government contracts will be just as bad, so consider these a litmus test for whether or not you are up for the challenge.",
                "Think about your company and what it can offer the government. It is important to have a very good understanding of your own company, and what it has to offer, before seeking government contracts. Identify the specific product or services that you can provide, and think about how much you can reasonably charge to do so, and still make a profit.",
                "Be prepared to apply for security clearance. Most defense contracts require that some, if not all, of the employees who will be involved in carrying out the contract have security clearance. Think about your own background and any problems that might be present there. If you did not run background checks on your employees when you hired them, you should discuss your intentions to apply for government contracts with them, and let them know that they may be required to obtain security clearance to continue with the company.",
                "Get ready to do a lot of paperwork. Applying for and carrying out a federal contract requires completing a lot of paperwork, and keeping very careful records. Be sure that you are up for the challenge before proceeding, and budget extra time and resources to dealing with this paperwork.[6]",
                "Determine the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code for the service or product you want to provide. You will need this information to look for contracts, and complete applications. It can be located at www.naics.com/search.",
                "Register as a government contractor. You will need to apply for a D-U-N-S identification number from the company Dun & Bradstreet.[7] Obtaining your D-U-N-S number is free of charge.",
                "Check the government website frequently for open contracts. All federal contracts that go out for bid, including those for the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces, are listed on the “Fed Biz Ops” website www.fbo.gov. Check the site frequently for contracts that your business might be able to compete for.",
                "Contact your local Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for assistance. These centers are located in most states, and can help you figure out the best way to market your product or service to the DOD. They can also offer more general advice on marketing, and to small business in general.",
                "Present your proposal to the agency making the request. Be sure to follow all directions in the call for bids in your proposal, and to clearly and specifically explain how your company can provide the product or service that the agency is seeking. Provide detailed product brochures, and any other helpful materials, and make your presentation as professional and clear as possible.",
                "Make and maintain contacts in the industry. Databases are very helpful, but having real human contacts in the defense industry is crucial to getting the inside scoop on upcoming opportunities, and how best to market yourself for open contracts. Identify specific agencies that you would like to contract with, and seek out contacts within them. Attend any events that these agencies might hold, and follow closely any websites or publications they maintain.[8]",
                "Comply with the security clearance process. If you are awarded a contract that requires security clearance, the agency hiring you will send you information on obtaining security clearance for yourself, your company, and your facility, depending on the nature of the contract. Be ready to complete any preliminary paperwork that is requested, and to fully comply with all facets of the investigation. Failure to comply or to pass the investigation process will lead to the revocation of your contract.[9]"

To strengthen your relationship with your cat, you will also need to create a safe, positive environment for it. You'll also need to teach the cat to associate you with things it already likes, such as food. Whether your cat it young or old, you can build a great relationship with it with a little work and patience.",
            "steps": [
                "Socialize your cat as early as possible. To build a strong relationship with a cat, you must first ensure that it is comfortable with people in general. Socializing young kittens is important for their future relationships with people.\n\n\nSocialization with people between 2 and 7 weeks of age sets the stage for the rest of the cat’s life.[1]\n\nSocialization includes holding the kitten and encouraging it to interact with people and animals. These interactions need to be pleasant for the cat to want to continue them in the future.[2]\n\nConsider kitten socialization classes. Your veterinarian likely has some resources for you to consider.[3]",
                "Be patient with older cats. If you have an older cat, don't despair. You can still work with it. Positive interactions go a long way at all ages to make friends with a cat.\n\n\nEven a cat that has been feral (living wild, without people) for up to four years can be socialized.[4]\n\nSocializing an older cat requires a great deal more time an patience. The steps described in this article still apply. But, you should be prepared for the cat to take a much longer time to accept you.",
                "Create a comfortable environment for the cat. A cat won’t want to socialize if it doesn’t feel comfortable and safe. Create a calm and non-threatening environment when introducing a new cat to your home.\n\n\nBegin by putting it in a quiet room where it can get comfortable in the space. Your bedroom is a good choice. Spending time here will help your cat get used to your scent.[5] Gradually allow the cat to explore more of the environment as it becomes more comfortable.\nGive the cat comfortable and fun surfaces to lay on (and in). A cat tree can be great for a cat that needs a little security and a place to call their own.\nThe cat should have access to food, water, a litter box, and a scratching post.[6]",
                "Keep a respectful distance. Don’t hover over or crowd the cat. By staying calm and keeping your distance, you’re showing the cat you aren’t a threat and it shouldn’t fear you.\n\n\nThis is especially important for older cats that are not used to spending time around people. Giving a cat like this too much attention will actually do more harm than good. You must let a cat like this come to you.\nSit and read or watch TV, ignoring the cat. Scatter treats or the cat’s food around the room and encourage the cat to hang out and hunt for food.[7] The cat will follow the treats and slowly get closer to you. Stay still. Don’t reach out or talk to the kitty at first. Let them get used to hanging out in the same room. The food is creating a positive association with you being nearby.\nLet the cat come to you. Dangle or toss a toy to make yourself more interesting. Don’t try to pet the cat right away, as you may scare it. Let your presence be non-threatening at first, then work up to petting the cat, even one pet at a time. Don’t push it, or you will need to start over winning your cat’s trust.[8]\n\nRemember that it may take awhile for your cat to know that you do not intend to harm it. It doesn't know you yet. Show it your love by being patient when it is new to your home.",
                "Use a pheromone diffuser to calm a scared cat. These diffusers contain a calming cat pheromone that can help an anxious cat feel comfortable and relaxed.\n\n\nPheromone diffusers are very simple to use. All you have to do is plug them into a wall outlet, like many commercial air-freshening products. Then, just check them periodically to ensure they haven't run out of liquid.\nYou can find these diffusers at most pet and online retailers.",
                "Pet the cat gently when it invites you to. Cats are easily over-stimulated, and a cat will become anxious or defensive if you try to show it affection when it isn’t welcome. Make sure the cat associates you with wanted, gentle affection, not anxiety.\n\n\nGently pet the cat if it rubs against you. When your cat rubs itself on your body, that is a friendly gesture. Reinforce the connection it is making with you by taking the opportunity to pet.\nCats like to have their heads and necks scratched. They also like gentle pets on the back, right where the spine meets the tail.[9] Full-back strokes can be overstimulating and cause a cat distress to the point it may claw or bite you.\nOffering a treat after handling your cat helps it create a positive association with touch.[10]",
                "Pick up your cat when it is relaxed. Pet the cat as long as it seems to enjoy it, and then pick it up and deliver it to a nice sunny spot or to food. You are trying to create the idea that being picked up is a good thing.\n\n\nDon't forcibly hold a cat that doesn't want you to.[11] This could break the trust you have built up with them. This is especially crucial for older cats.\nThere are times when you will need to pick up your cat against its will, for instance when you need to put it in a carrier. Be sure to do this as gently as possible, making sure to calm the cat with a nice tone of voice, petting, and perhaps even treats.",
                "Seek veterinary intervention if all else fails. Fearful and anxious adult cats may need prescription medication to help the socialization process. Talk to your veterinarian if the suggestions above don't seem to work.[12]\n\nThere are veterinary behavior specialists that may be able to help in extreme cases. Ask your regular vet for a referral.",
                "Make sure you are the one feeding the cat. Once your cat is comfortable with your presence, you can start building a positive relationship. Food is a powerful motivator, and you want to be the person your cat associates with food. This will help your cat associate something positive to your presence.\n\n\nFeed your cat two or three small meals a day, rather than leaving food out. That will reinforce the association between you and food. If you leave dry food out for your cat, you can still use small meals of wet food in this way.\nStay in the room while your cat eats, to help strengthen the association between you and the food. You can also pet the cat while it eats.\nFeeding high-value treats will also reinforce that you are the provider of all things good and tasty. Use the treats to reinforce good behavior, such as if the cat rubs up against your leg or shows you affection.[13]",
                "Make sure your cat is spayed or neutered. It will be easier for a cat to bond with you if it isn’t driven by the instinct to mate with other cats.[14]\n\nSpaying and neutering is also important to limit cat populations. This is especially important if your cat will live partially outdoors.[15] If your cat is not spayed or neutered, contact a veterinary clinic or your local humane society to set up an appointment.",
                "Speak to your cat. Talk to your cat often, using a calm and non-threatening tone.[16] Your tone of voice, along with your body language, conveys a message. Make sure that message is kind and gentle.\n\n\nYelling at a cat (or any animal for that matter) will frighten it and cause it to distrust you. Even if your cat has misbehaved, try not to shout at it.",
                "Play with your cat. Once the cat feels comfortable approaching you, dangle a toy or string to invite the cat to play. Your cat may not want to play with you all the time, so take the opportunity when it does to bond with your pet.\n\n\nMany cats like catnip. Consider buying a toy that contains the herb to encourage play.[17]\n\nPlaying with your cat will be most successful when the cat invites you to interact with it. For example, it may rub up against you or climb on you. While you can sometimes entice a cat to play with a flashy toy or a dangling string, your cat may ignore you if it doesn't want to play.",
                "Keep your cat, and it's litter box, clean. Cats need a clean coat and clean surroundings to be content. Clean out it's litter box regularly, so it does not have to use filthy litter. A dirty litter box will often make a cat anxious and unhappy, leading it to act out.[18]\n\nWhile your cat will probably spend a lot of time grooming, you may want to groom it yourself to bond with it. Try brushing the animal with a brush made for cats. Some cats will not allow you to, but others will enjoy the sensation. This will have the added benefit of lessening the cat fur in your house, especially if your cat is a long-haired breed.[19]",
                "Keep your cat healthy. A cat may become withdrawn or avoidant if it has unaddressed health issues. Make sure to take you cat in for regular veterinary check-ups. Contact the vet if you notice significant changes in your cat’s health or behavior.\n\n\nYour cat will not know that you are looking out for its well-being by taking it for check-ups. But, keeping it healthy is actually the best way for you to express your affection.\nThe cat may not show you love while you are putting it in a cat carrier, but the healthy years you get to spend together should more than make up for that.",
                "Recognize the signs of affection. Everybody knows that purring is a sign of a contented cat. You may not know that a slow blink from your cat is also a sign of contentment and acceptance.\n\n\nTry slow blinking back to your cat. Some people call this a “cat kiss.” Your cat may recognize this as a sign that you are non-threatening, and that you are a friend.[20]"

        "How to Sing High Notes": {
            "intro": "Every singer wants to increase their vocal range, and hitting high notes is the most impressive feat of all. No one is born being able to sing the highest notes perfectly, though! Vocal cords need exercise, just like other muscles, to get stronger. Start by learning how to relax your muscles. Then get your voice warmed up and practice specific exercises to help you increase your range.",
            "steps": [
                "Take slow, relaxed breaths to release tension. Your breathing needs to be relaxed to hit high notes. Otherwise, that tension goes right into your voice. Take a normal breath in, then exhale. Keep your breath slow and even.\n\n\nRelax your shoulders, neck and chest as you continue to breathe in and out. This helps release tension from those areas.[1]",
                "Massage your face and jaw muscles to release jaw tension. Put the heels of your hands on either side of your face, right below your cheekbones. Push them gently into your cheeks, then move them slowly down into your jaws. Let your mouth hang open a little bit. Repeat this several times.[2]",
                "Do some neck and shoulder rolls to loosen up the muscles. Slowly roll your neck from side to side. Once your neck feels stretched out, roll your shoulders gently and slowly, backward and forward. Then let your arms hang loosely at your sides.[3]\n\nTry to keep your arms loose as you practice. Avoid the urge to ball up your fists or strain your arm muscles when trying to hit high notes.",
                "Drink a glass of warm water to relax throat muscles. It also helps hydrate the vocal chords, allowing you to reach the higher registers. Add honey to your water to decrease and/or prevent their throat from swelling.[4]\n\nDon't drink ice water, caffeine or milk before warming up your voice. These can have a negative effect on your singing voice.",
                "Trill with your lips to warm them up. Press your lips together loosely. Release air through your mouth in a steady stream, so that your lips vibrate and make a raspberry sound. Move on to doing this with “h” sounds, maintaining a steady voice as you move the air past your lips.\n\n\nOnce you’ve got that, try it on “b” sounds. Then continue doing “b” sounds, but go up and down the scales.[5]",
                "Stretch out your vocal chords with “sirens.” Round your mouth into an “o” position and inhale. It helps to imagine you’re sucking down a spaghetti noodle! When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. Keep your “woo” steady and repeat this 2-3 more times.\n\n\nAfter that, start going up and down the scales as you “woo.”[6]",
                "Do two octave scales to warm up for higher notes. Starting in a low pitch, sing a “me” sound as you go up the scale. Reverse and go down the scale as you sing an “ee” sound. Keep going, up and down, gently increasing your range each time.\n\n\nOnce you’re feeling pretty loose, switch to an “oo” sound and repeat.[7]\n\nDuring warm up, don't push your voice to go higher than what’s comfortable for you. This can actually decrease your range over time.[8]",
                "Breathe from your abdomen for a stronger sound. As a singer, you’ve probably heard this advice countless times. It’s important, though! It helps you hit and maintain high notes, and helps to relax your muscles.[9]\n\nWhen you inhale, your stomach should rise first, followed by your chest.\nIf you have trouble with this, try putting your hand on your abdomen as you breathe. It’ll remind you to focus on breathing from that area.",
                "Start in the middle of your range and sing higher and higher. This can be a continuation of the “oo” and “ee” sounds you used in warm-up. Once you get your voice up into the high register that you want, open up those vowel sounds to sound more like “oh” and “uh.”[10]\n\nAs you practice this over time, you’ll notice that the higher notes are getting easier and easier to reach.",
                "Experiment with your vowel sounds. Each voice has certain vowels that work best when singing high notes. Others are harder to hit. You should experiment to determine which vowels work and sound best for you. Once you have an idea of which vowel works best, modify (gradually) towards that vowel as you ascend the scale.\n\n\nFor example, you might have a hard time hitting a long \"e\" (like in \"meet\"), but you can easily hit a short \"i.\" You could modify the long \"e\" in \"meet\" by singing \"mitt\" and subtly adjusting the \"i\" into the long \"e\" as you get higher.[11]",
                "Start putting a consonant in front of vowels. Consonants, like a hard “g,” can help you get better at cord closure. After practicing vowels for a while, put a hard “g” in front of them. This helps you maintain a steady sound by keeping your vocal cords vibrating steadily.[12]\n\nAlso work on consonants like “m” and “n” in front of vowels.\nCord closure is when your vocal cords come together to create a sound. If they aren’t “closed” all the way, it's difficult to maintain steady air flow.[13]",
                "Sing the word \"yawn\" on the high notes to get your mouth in position. When rehearsing, never hesitate to sing the word \"yawn\" for one of those notes in your upper range. When you sing that word, it positions your mouth and throat in exactly the right place to hit high notes. This is a handy trick to help you get used to the proper mouth positioning; don't do this during a performance, though!",
                "Keep your sounds smooth and connected. Steady airflow allows you to hit and maintain your high notes. As you work on your range, keep your breath flowing in and out steadily. Strive to make smooth, connected sounds.[14]\n\nThink about the whole phrase that includes the high note, then support your voice continuously from the beginning. This connects the high note to the notes before it.\nForcing out air on certain notes can strain your throat and voice.",
                "Cool down after each session to prevent injury. Working on high notes is hard on your vocal cords. To keep those muscles operating well, cool them down after you work them out. To do this, hum gently while making an “m” sound. Move up and down the scales as you make the “m” sound.[15]\n\nFocus on how the sound feels coming out of your lips. It will vibrate and tickle a little bit!"

        "How to Heal a Cold Sore Naturally": {
            "intro": "Cold sores are caused by a form of the Herpes Simplex Virus known as HSV-1. They exhibit as painful ulcers around the mouth and lips. Cold sores are also called fever blisters and are very common. This virus is similar to (but not the same as) the virus that causes genital herpes, which is HSV-2. While they are different viruses, both can be found on the lips and on the genitalia. Those infected with either virus can also spread the viruses through close personal contact during kissing, oral sex, or any oral contact.[1][2][3]",
            "steps": [
                "Eat lysine-rich foods. Lysine is an amino acid that some studies have shown to help treat and prevent cold sore outbreaks by blocking arginine, which is another amino acid that is required for viral growth.[4][5][6] Lysine-rich foods include fish, meat (poultry, lamb, beef), dairy products, mung bean sprouts, and beans.[7]\n\nYou can also take a lysine supplement. The dosage is usually 500-1000 mg every day taken on an empty stomach. The safe limit of lysine is less than 3000 mg a day, so don’t take any more than the recommended dosage.[8]",
                "Avoid foods that are high in arginine. Arginine is also an amino acid, but one that serves as a building block for the herpes virus, helping it to spread. The highest concentrations of arginine are found in whole grains, seeds, nuts and chocolate.",
                "Stay away from acidic foods. This is particularly important if they will come in contact with the cold sore should you eat them. The herpes virus thrives in an acidic environment, so it is important to keep all acid away from the sores. Acidic foods to avoid include citrus fruits, tomatoes and anything with vinegar.",
                "Take a daily zinc supplement. Zinc may help boost your immune system and help prevent future cold sores. The recommended dose to boost your immune system is 10 mg/day for adult men and women.[9] For children, consult their pediatrician.\n\n\nThere are also zinc creams that you can use. An example is Virunderim gel, which contains 10% zinc sulfate.[10] You can use this for up to twelve days at the first symptoms of a cold sore to help minimize the duration.",
                "Eat to boost your immune system and help your body to fight off the virus. Include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet daily. Some of the best choices for boosting the immune system are cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, onion and garlic.",
                "Ice the cold sore as soon as you feel it forming. Repeat the application regularly. The herpes virus requires a moist, warm environment to grow. Cool the sore and keep it from warming back up to prevent it from growing bigger and to speed up healing.",
                "Apply lemon balm or lemon extract directly to the sore.[11] Soak a cotton ball in the lemon balm and dab it on the cold sore 2 to 3 times a day.",
                "Make a salt, milk and lemon juice treatment. Add a little lemon juice and milk to salt. The acid in the lemon juice is buffered by the protein in the milk, so it won't sting as much. Roll the mixture into a ball. Dab on the cold sore once a day. After application, dab a little aloe vera on the cold sore.",
                "Put salt on a cold sore.[12] Moisten your finger and then dip it in regular table salt. Put your salty finger on the cold sore and press gently for 30 seconds to allow the salt time to enter the sore. Wash your hands with hot, soapy water after touching the sore.",
                "Apply a teabag to a cold sore.[13] Soak a tea bag in hot water, allow it to cool, and then apply the wet bag to the sore for 5 to 10 minutes. Use a fresh tea bag and repeat the process every 1 to 2 hours.",
                "Use a topical oil, such as lavender oil or melissa oil. Both are known to speed the healing of cold sores. Apply the oil to the sore several times a day.",
                "Use an herbal remedy.\n\n\nDab the sore with the topical form of Saint John's wort several times a day, following packaging instructions carefully. Topical Saint John's wort should only be used externally, and never while taking other forms of Saint John's wort, as too much of the herb can be dangerous.\nTake 1 teaspoon of strong Echinacea root 3 times a day. Swish it around in your mouth for 2 to 3 minutes, then swallow it.\nApply chamomile tincture to the sore a few times a day. Or, drink chamomile tea and let the hot liquid linger on the sore. Chamomile contains bisabolol, a substance that helps to heal sores on mucous membranes.",
                "Avoid touching the cold sores. In addition to aggravating the cold sore, touching it can transfer the HSV-1 virus responsible for cold sores to your fingers. This makes it easier to spread the virus by accident due to other contact. The virus can infect the skin cells with which it comes in contact even when they’re skin cells on another part of your own body. Avoid this complication by avoiding contact with the cold sore as much as possible.",
                "Wash your hands often. Even when mindfully trying not to touch a cold sore, people often poke at them without thinking. Wash your hands often, especially after realizing that you have touched the cold sore or the general area around your lips and mouth.\n\n\nThis is especially true before and after eating.",
                "Stock up on toothbrushes. The virus can continue to live on surfaces such as toothbrushes. To avoid potentially spreading the area in which you get cold sores, start using a new toothbrush as soon as you feel symptoms coming on, and throw it away when the cold sore has healed.\n\n\nAs an additional safety measure, ensure that your toothbrush does not come into contact with the opening of the toothpaste tube when applying toothpaste.[14]",
                "Don’t share objects. Avoid sharing towels, razors, eating utensils, or washcloths with anyone. Make sure you wash anything that has potentially come into contact with your cold sore with hot, soapy water.",
                "Use an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen. One of the known triggers for cold sores is sun exposure.[15][16] By using a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, you can help the cold sore heal by minimizing the damaging effects of the sun.\n\n\nConsistently using sunscreen around the area even without an outbreak will help to minimize the recurrence of future cold sores as well.\nRemember to wash your hands both before and after applying the sunscreen.",
                "Use a moisturizer. You can apply a tiny dab of petroleum jelly or propolis with a Q-tip. Organic moisturizing products that contain lysine are also helpful, such as Basic Organics Lysine Ointment or 100% Pure Lysine + Herbs by Ariva.\n\n\nPropolis is a natural, nutrient-rich resin made by bees.",
                "Make your own moisturizer. If you prefer to know exactly what goes into your natural moisturizer, you can make your own at home with propolis and essential oils. A 3% propolis ointment has been shown to reduce the pain of cold sores.[17] To make the ointment, take 0.5 ounces of propolis (equal to one tablespoon) and add 48.5 ounces of pure coconut oil, which works great as a moisturizer.[18] From there, add one drop of each of the following:\n\n\nCamphor oil, which helps with pain reduction\nEchinacea oil, which is an antiviral herb that can help boost the immune system[19][20]\n\nLicorice oil, which has effective properties against HSV-1[21]\n\nAndrographis oil, which has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties[22]\n\nSage oil, which also has antiviral properties to help dry out a cold sore and it a good alternative if you have trouble finding andrographis oil[23]",
                "Examine your risk for future outbreaks. Many of those who test positive for the HSV-1 virus do not experience cold sores, and many more don’t have recurrent cold sores after initial outbreaks.[24] However, those at a higher risk for recurrent cold sores include those with:[25]\n\nA weakened immune system, i.e. are immunosuppressed\nHIV/AIDS, which is a cause of immunosuppression\nEczema\nCancer who are taking chemotherapy\nAn organ transplant, which means the patient is taking immunosuppressant drugs to prevent organ rejection\nSevere burns",
                "Examine your potential outbreak triggers. Certain triggers are tied to the likelihood of a person experiencing future outbreaks as well. These triggers include:\n\n\nFever of any kind (whether from another viral or a bacterial infection)\nMenstruation\nStress of any kind (physical, mental, or emotional)\nFatigue\nSun Exposure\nSurgery",
                "Avoid too much time in the sun. Since sun exposure is a trigger for cold sore outbreaks, you should minimize your time in the sun. Remember always to wear sunscreen as well to minimize effects when you are outside.",
                "Eat a balanced diet. A balanced, nutritious diet can help reduce triggers like fatigue and stress. The main components of a healthy diet include:\n\n\nLots of fresh fruit and fresh vegetables. Include a variety of both fruits (except citrus) and vegetables. Both fruit and vegetables contain vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fiber to keep you as healthy as you can be.\nComplex carbohydrates versus simple sugars. This means that you should stay away from processed and packaged foods. They often seem simpler, but during the processing and packaging, all kinds of sugars are added, including high-fructose corn syrup.\nThese sugars are associated with glucose-intolerance (pre-diabetes), diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease as well as alterations in the gut bacteria.[26][27]\n\nIncreased amounts of fish and lean poultry in your diet (as well as decreasing the amounts of red meat).\nBeans and legumes, which are excellent sources of vitamins and minerals. They do contain phytic acid, but normal cooking should release most of the minerals and allow them to be absorbed by your body.\nDon’t forget to keep drinking water and staying hydrated. Drink at least 6-8 8-ounce glasses of water each day.",
                "Get plenty of sleep. Poor sleep schedules have an effect on both stress and fatigue levels. Ensure that you get 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night.",
                "Avoid stress. Though often unavoidable at work or at home, try to avoid stressful situations as much as possible. This can mean walking away from a situation or something as simple as taking a few minutes away from your desk at work. Other steps you can take to avoid stress or at least balance it include:\n\n\nSpending time with friends[28]\n\nGoing for a walk or to the gym[29]\n\nIntroducing deep breathing or meditation techniques into your daily routine[30][31] You can find a guide to these techniques at How to Breathe Deeply and How to Meditate.",
                "Boost your immune system. In addition to diet and exercise, you can take other steps to boost your immune system as well. These steps include not smoking, drinking only in moderation, avoiding sickness and other infections by washing your hands regularly, and controlling your blood pressure.",
                "See your doctor. Cold sores rarely lead to any complications, and they don’t typically require a trip to your doctor. However, you should make an appointment to see your doctor if:[32]\n\nYou get cold sores more than 2-3 times a year\nYour cold sores don’t heal within two weeks\nYou get sick frequently, which may signify a weakened immune system\nThe cold sores are very painful\nYour eyes are irritated when you have a cold sore, which may indicate further infection"

            "intro": "Papier-mâché (pap-yay mash-ay) or paper mâché (paper mash-ay) is an easy to make, hard material that can be used to cover various surfaces. It is often used in arts and crafts to make various sculptures, fruit bowls, puppets, dolls and much more. The surface is easy to paint, allowing you to add patterns, bright colors, and interesting designs to your finished product. This article details how to make the basic papier mâché that can be used for any project that you have in mind.",
            "steps": [
                "Clear an area. Papier-mâché can get a bit messy (what good DIY project doesn't?), so to protect your grandma's beloved dining table, lay down a few newspapers or other scrap material to keep clean up at a minimum. While you are grabbing newspaper, also get a hold of:\n\nA bowl or large container\nFlour, wallpaper powder/paste, or white glue\nWater\nYour base structure\nPaintbrush\nNewspaper (for your project -- not for clean-up duty)",
                "Tear the newspaper into long strips. The ideal width would be around one inch (2.5 cm) thick, but each project requires different shapes and sizes. In addition, you will want to go around your project three times, so tear quite a pile. Don't opt for the scissors -- a torn edge blends better than a cut edge.\n\nThere is no wrong size your strips could be. In fact, if you want to add volume to your structure by molding the strips, you will need different sizes. So tear away freely.",
                "Choose your method to make papier mâché. A few slight variations will result in the same product. Use what you have at your disposal.\n\n\nGlue mixture: Pour 2 parts white glue and one part water into a mixing bowl. These quantities can be changed to suit the size of your project. Or, if you have a stronger bonding glue, 1 part white glue and 1 part water will do the trick.\n\nFlour mixture: Combine 1 part flour with 1 part water. Easy as pie!\n\nFor super large and intense projects, you may want to substitute white glue for the water.\n\n\n\nWallpaper powder: Pour 2 parts wallpaper powder and one part water into a mixing bowl. This method is good if you're thinking seriously long-term -- it can last years.",
                "Blend your choice of mixture. Do this using a paintbrush, a mixing spoon or mixing stick. Blend until it forms a smooth consistency.\n\nIf it's too thin or thick, adjust accordingly. Add more adhesive base if it's too thin, water if it's too thick.",
                "Find a surface you want to papier-mâché. Examples include a balloon, cardboard or a molded figure. In addition, you can papier-mâché two objects together to form a creation! The mixture will take to anything.\n\nIf you're using a balloon, consider painting it with cooking oil beforehand -- that way, when it's dry, you can slide it out easily.",
                "Dip a strip of newspaper into the mixture. You're going to get your fingers messy! The messier you get, the better job you're doing.",
                "Remove any excess mixture. Do this by lightly sliding two fingers from the top to the bottom of the strip of paper. Hold it over the bowl so it drips back into the container.",
                "Lay the strip over the surface or figure. Smooth it out, using either your fingers or a paintbrush. Be sure to get as many of the creases and bumps out as you can. You are aiming to get a very smooth surface for painting and decorating.\n\nIf you'd like to create a shape (a face, say), bunch the strip into the form you want, place it on your surface, and then layer another strip on top to smooth it out. This can create volume, texture, and detail quite easily.",
                "Repeat laying strips. Do this until the entire surface or figure is covered three times over. This is especially important if you're removing the base when it's dry -- it needs to be sturdy and hold its own.\n\nPut your first layer on horizontally, the second vertically, and so forth. It will help show you where you have been before and strengthen the piece.",
                "Place the object on a covered surface to dry. It will need a day or so to completely dry, depending on the size of your piece. Leave it untouched until tomorrow, then see if it's ready for painting.",
                "Start coloring. Paint or decorate as desired. Enjoy! (And be sure to tell everyone you did it yourself.)\n\nSome schools of thought say to start with a white primer. If you're using a light color on the piece, you may want to use this method (otherwise some print may stick out). Make sure not to cover to top part in order to take the balloon out."

        "wikiHow to Insert a Cannula": {
            "intro": "Intravenous (IV) cannulation, also known as insertion of a peripheral venous catheter (PVC), is a fairly straightforward medical procedure. However, it does take some technique and preparation to complete safely. While different professionals may adapt the technique a bit to their own preferences, the basic procedure involves gathering appropriate materials and properly preparing the insertion site, inserting the needle, and performing appropriate maintenance and cleanup after the catheter is inserted.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather materials. Cannulation requires some basic preparation and precaution. You will need to protect yourself from contact with a patient's body fluids and you need to protect the patient from injury or infection. In order to do this you will need:[1]\n\nNon-sterile gloves\nTourniquet\nAntiseptic solution or alcohol wipes\nLocal anesthetic solution (optional)\nSyringe with needle of appropriate gauge\nVenous access device\nTransparent dressing\nPaper tape\nSharps container",
                "Choose the size of the cannula you will use. In general, the larger gauge needle you use, the higher the maximum flow rate of the fluid entering into the vein. Larger sized needles actually have a smaller number, so a 14 gauge is large, while a 22 gauge is small. Choose a size that can easily fulfill the purpose of the procedure but is not oversized.[2]\n\nThe smallest needles are used in children. The largest are used for rapid blood transfusion.",
                "Have a discussion with your patient. Get informed consent from the patient before you begin the procedure. This is usually done verbally. This builds up a rapport with the patient and allows for a less traumatic experience.\n\n\nIntroduce yourself to your patient.\nVerify your patient’s identity before starting any procedures.\nExplain the procedure to the patient and answer any questions they may have.\nAlso take a quick history, primarily to exclude any allergy or sensitivity that the patient may have. This is particularly true for latex allergy. Should an allergy to latex be confirmed, then the tourniquet, gloves, and the cannula must be latex-free.",
                "Wash your hands and put on gloves. All medical professionals should follow thorough and proper hygiene practices before coming into contact with a patient. It is important to keep the risk of the patient getting infection to a minimum while inserting a cannula by washing your hands thoroughly and putting on gloves. [3]",
                "Use proper personal protective equipment. Using gloves will not only protect your patient, but will also protect you from exposure to bodily fluids and potentially infectious material. A single pair of non-sterile gloves will probably be sufficient for this task.[4]\nDepending on your facility’s requirements, you may also wish to wear protective eyewear when inserting or removing an IV catheter.[5]",
                "Apply the tourniquet around the patient's arm. In most cases, the patient’s non-dominant arm is preferable. The tourniquet should be placed on the arm just above the cannulation site. Tighten it appropriately, so that the patient's veins are highlighted.[6][7] Other methods for locating a good vein include:[8]\n\nTapping on the vein to make it dilate.\nAsking the patient to open and close their fist.\nUsing gravity to highlight the vein by holding the patient’s arm down.\nApplying mild heat to the site of the vein.\nIf you have a difficult time finding a good vein on the arm you have selected, inspect the opposite arm. In some cases (e.g. if the patient has diabetes or a history of IV drug abuse), you may need to use an ultrasound to help you locate a good vein.[9]",
                "Clean the skin. Using an alcohol wipe or antiseptic solution, clear away pathogens on the skin around the vein used for cannulation. Apply the antiseptic to the site with friction for 30-60 seconds, and then allow the site to air dry for up to one minute. This will help prevent the risk of infection and reduce stinging.[10][11][12]\n\nIf the area is really covered in hair, you may need to shave it. This will help you to identify the vein, get a clear aim at it, and it will help when cleaning the area.",
                "Insert the cannula needle at an appropriate angle. The correct angle will depend on the size of the device and the depth of the vein.[13]\nIf you are trying to access a small, superficial vein, you should use a small catheter (with a gauge of 22-24) and insert at an angle of 10°-25°.\nFor a deeper vein, use a larger catheter and insert at an angle of 30°-45°.\nMake sure you insert the needle bevel up (with its eye is facing upwards). This means that the point of the needle is down against the skin.",
                "Advance the cannula until you achieve flashback. Hold the cannula in the front of its wings with your pointer and middle finger and in the back with your thumb. Advance it slowly into the skin until blood enters the base of the cannula. This is called a flashback, and it signals that you have entered a vein.[14]\n\nOnce flashback occurs, reduce the angle of the needle to avoid puncturing the posterior wall of the vein.",
                "Advance the plastic piece of the cannula. The needle should now be held stationary while the plastic component of the cannula is advanced another 2-3 mm into the vein.[15] The goal is to get the plastic sheath into the vein, and keep it there, while the needle is removed.[16]\n\nKeep advancing the plastic component of the cannula until the plastic tube is fully inserted. The \"hub\" of the plastic component will hit the skin when it is all the way in.",
                "Allow blood to flow into an attachment. Remove the tourniquet from the patient's arm. Remove the needle from the base of the cannula, leaving the plastic component in sight. Allow blood to flow into the base of the cannula, so there is less risk of air going into the vein if something is injected through the cannula, called an air embolism.[17]\n\nThen cap the cannula or attach test tubes or other supplies.",
                "Find another vein, if your catheterization is unsuccessful. If you are unable to catheterize a vein successfully, never attempt to reinsert the needle. This could result in fragmentation of the catheter and embolism in the patient.[18]",
                "Secure the cannula with an appropriate dressing. If the cannula needs to stay in the vein, you will need to secure it. Using transparent dressing and tape, or a specialized dressing that comes with the cannula, secure the venous access device to the skin. Attach the cannula to the skin so that it is comfortable for the patient but stays in place in the vein. You may need to tape attachments to the skin as well, for example a tube leading to another attachment point.\n\n\nPlace a label over the transparent dressing with the date, time, and any other information required by your facility.\nIf you are simply using the cannula to get several samples of blood, for example, extensive securing is not required. However, you do need to be sure that it stays in place long enough to get your sample, so you may want to tape it down a bit.",
                "Inspect and clean the cannula. First, pull back on the syringe to withdraw a little blood. This will confirm that the cannula is still in place inside the vein.[19] Then flush the cannula with a flushing solution, usually normal saline or heparin. This will assure that the site is clean and will check for adequate positioning within the vein.[20]\n\nTo flush the cannula you will need 5-10ml of saline in a syringe. This may come in a pre-filled syringe or you may need to fill it yourself. Flush the cannula by attaching the syringe of saline onto the cannula port, inject the saline into the port, detach the syringe, and then close the port.[21]\n\nIf you are returning to put an injection into a cannula, flush the it with saline solution again. This will assure that the cannula is still in place.",
                "Recatheterize, if necessary. If you do not observe blood in the flashback chamber when you inspect the cannula, you will need to recatheterize the vein. If there is no flashback, this may mean that the catheter has punctured the posterior wall of the vein. It can also occur in patients with severe hypotension (low blood pressure).[22]\nWithdraw the device until it is just below skin level, and attempt to recatheterize.\nIf swelling develops at the site, remove the device and release the tourniquet. Apply direct pressure to the site for 5 minutes.",
                "Clean up after the procedure. Dispose of the needle in a sharps container to reduce the risk of a needle stick. Dispose of any other waste appropriately.[23]\n\nDocument the procedure in the appropriate set of notes.\nIf removing the cannula, place a piece of gauze on the injection site and keep it in place with medical tape or a bandage. This will assure that the patient is not bleeding after the procedure."

        "How to Diagnose Kidney Failure in Cats": {
            "intro": "In cats over the age of 7 years with kidney disease, having the disease is part of the natural aging process. In animals less than 4 years of age, kidney problems are more likely to be the result of a genetic predisposition. The kidney has many jobs to do, but most important of these is filtering natural toxins out of the blood stream and reclaiming water that would otherwise be lost in the urine. Therefore, it is important to be sensitive to the signs of kidney failure so the cat can be diagnosed and treated as efficiently as possible.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the difficulties surrounding early detection. The kidneys have a huge reserve capacity and it isn't until at least 75% of total kidney function is lost that the cat shows clinical signs of a problem.\n\n\nThus, by the time a diagnosis can be reached the cat is coping on a maximum of 25% of the renal capacity when healthy. (This sounds alarming, but remember when people donate a kidney, they automatically lose 50% of their renal capacity and yet do not become ill).\nUnfortunately, as total kidney function declines, the nephrons (the individual filtration units contained in the kidneys) which are still working are asked to work harder and so their demise is hastened. It is therefore important to identify renal disease in the cat are early as possible because early treatment extends the life of the remaining nephrons.\nHowever, early detection is problematic because blood screening is relatively insensitive up to the point where 75% damage has occurred. Many vet clinics offer routine yearly, or six-monthly screening programs for senior (over the age of 7 years) cats.\nMany cats’ kidneys can compensate even if as many as 90% of the nephrons in their kidneys are destroyed. This will delay a diagnosis if the owner is not looking for signs of kidney failure or it may seem like the symptoms are just a part of the cat getting older",
                "Watch your cat carefully for symptoms. Kidney failure is usually accompanied by a range of symptoms. The symptoms occur as the body adapts in order to minimize the effects of kidney disease.\n\n\nAs an owner you may notice little changes in your cat early on, such as the need to fill the water bowl more often, or empty the litter tray more regularly. These are signs that the cat is drinking more, a sign which should never be ignored.\nHowever, many of the signs associated with renal disease overlap with other conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, pancreatitis, or infections. This means that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on symptoms alone, but they are a strong hint that further steps need to be taken to get to the bottom of the problem.",
                "Look for signs of increased thirst. You may notice if your cat develops unusual habits such as drinking from the toilet or if the water bowl constantly needs topping up. Increased thirst happens as a result of the kidney losing its ability to recycle water from the blood stream.\n\n\nThe body loses water through the urine, which is more dilute, and so this water needs to be replaced, causing increased thirst in the cat.",
                "Take note of whether the cat is urinating more often. Because the cat is drinking more and is not able to concentrate her urine as well, the volume of urine produced is larger. This means the bladder fills more often and the cat needs to urinate more often to stay comfortable.\n\n\nCardinal signs are needing to clean the litter tray more often, or a break down in house training habits, such as urinating outside of the litterbox.",
                "Watch the cat for signs of dehydration. Even though the cat drinks more, there is often an imbalance between water loss and water taken in, which results in the gradual development of dehydration.\n\n\nVeterinarians assess this during a physical examination by looking at how quickly the scruff springs back to its normal position. To do this, gently grasp a piece of scruff over the shoulder blades, between the finger and thumb of one hand. Lift the scruff 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) away from the backbone and release it.\nIn a well-hydrated animal the scruff springs straight back into the normal position. In a dehydrated animal the skin loses elasticity which means it returns slowly to the resting position. If the skin takes over a second to slip back down then the cat is probably dehydrated.",
                "Identify any weight loss. As part of the kidneys impaired ability to filter, large molecules such as protein tend to leak through the kidneys and be lost in the urine. Protein loss represents an important waste of calories.\n\n\nAnother reason for weight loss is that the buildup of natural toxins often makes the cat feel nauseous, which reduces her appetite.\nA cat that is usually overweight will suddenly become lighter, or a normal weight cat will lose muscle mass. The fat pad between the cat’s legs will also become saggy as it loses the fat deposits.",
                "Sniff your cat's breath. Cats get bad breath for many reasons, including rotten teeth, gum infections, diabetes mellitus, diet, and kidney failure. In kidney disease it is the toxins that cause the bad breath and this is described as having a typical ammonia-like smell.\n\n\nThis smell is not always easy to detect and some people's noses seem better tuned to pick up ammonia smells than others.",
                "Check for oral ulcers. The same toxins that cause bad breath also damage tissues and cause ulceration in the mouth and stomach lining. Of these, you can see the ulcers in the mouth. They tend to form along the margins of the tongue, or where the teeth meet the gum, and they may cause the cat to drool.\n\n\nAgain, ulcers do form for other reasons such as viral infections or if the cat has licked a caustic substance, but it remains a sign that needs to be taken note of.",
                "Identify any muscle wastage. Ultimately, when protein loss exceeds intake from the diet, the cat's muscle starts to break up to provide her with the necessary protein requirements.\n\n\nCats with kidney failure are typically thin, with dull coats and wasted muscles.",
                "Watch for vomiting and a poor appetite. Gastric ulcers caused by a buildup of toxins make the cat nauseous. This results in vomiting and a reluctance to eat.",
                "Feel the cat's kidney size. Scar tissue causes the kidneys to shrink and failing kidneys typically feel smaller than usual. Especially in thin cats, the kidneys are easy to feel in their location sitting beneath the lumbar vertebra (lower back).\n\n\nGauging their relative size is a subjective measurement and a skill that veterinarians acquire over the years. Don't try to feel your cat's kidneys at home.\nA normal kidney is usually equivalent in length to that of three lumbar vertebrae, and shrunken kidneys measure less than two lumbar vertebrae in length.",
                "Look for kidney symmetry and shape. Scar tissue forms fairly uniformly throughout the kidney and so the surface of the kidney feels smooth and both feel equally shrunken. However, cancerous kidneys often feel knobbly with a rough, bumpy surface.\n\n\nThe latter is an important indication for kidney biopsy because some renal cancers are amenable to chemotherapy, whereas old age kidney deterioration is not.",
                "Measure the cat's blood pressure. The kidney breaks down several hormones that control blood pressure. When the kidney is not working properly the levels of these hormones rise which creates an increased risk of high blood pressure o hypertension.\n\n\nOn physical examination the veterinarian may see telltale signs of hemorrhage on the retina, or even spot detached retinas, which are a common consequence of hypertension.\nOnce again, high pressure is not diagnostic of kidney failure, but a strong clue that needs to be followed up on. The blood pressure cuff used to measure your cat’s blood pressure is similar to the one used to measure human blood pressure. 120/80 is considered a normal blood pressure for your cat.[1]",
                "Do a dipstick urine analysis. Urine analysis is an extremely valuable tool for assessing renal health, especially in the early stages of kidney disease. A simple dipstick test can quickly rule out conditions which cause increased thirst such as diabetes, if no glucose is present.\n\n\nA dipstick test also gives a rough indication of the protein content of the urine. A high protein level can result from a urine infection (in which case blood is commonly present in the urine) or kidney disease.\nIf blood is present the clinician will suggest either treating preemptively with antibiotics, or sending the urine for culture. Only once the blood has cleared can a decision be reached that the protein is because of leakage from the kidney.\nYour cat’s veterinarian may also want to perform an Early Renal Damage (ERD) test, which checks your cat’s urine for the presence of microalbuminuria.[2]",
                "Try a specific gravity urine test. Specific gravity is a measure of how dilute or how concentrated the urine is. Cats are very efficient at concentrating their urine, in order to preserve water.\n\n\nSpecific gravity is measured relative to water (which is SG 1.000). A healthy urine SG is between 1.035 – 1.060. Urine below SG 1.035 is considered abnormally dilute. Urine SG below 1.025 is significantly dilute.\nDilute urine should contain very little protein, thus a result of a low SG and high protein level is an indicator that the kidneys are not concentrating urine and are leaking protein. This is an important pointer towards kidney disease, which can be detected before changes are evident in the blood test.",
                "Test the urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC). This test measures the ratio of protein in urine to another naturally occurring metabolite called creatinine. The normal value in the cat is below 0.4. Ratios above 1.0 indicate significant protein loss which needs investigating.",
                "Take a sample of the cat's blood for blood testing. Blood tests play an important role in identifying cats that have lost over 75% of their functional kidney capacity. Most useful for diagnosing kidney failure are three indicators: blood urea, creatinine, and phosphate levels.\n\n\n\nBlood Urea: Normal blood urea levels in the cat are less than 32mg/ml and levels above 35mg/ml are considered to be high. Whilst raised urea in the blood is an indicator of kidney failure, it can be high for other reasons. Therefore raised urea levels alone are not sufficient to diagnose renal failure.\n\nBlood Creatinine: The normal level in cats is below 130 umol/l. Any reading above 130 umol/l is likely to indicate renal disease. Creatinine is a waste product of protein breakdown and is only excreted by the kidneys.\n\nPhosphate levels: The kidney finds it difficult to excrete phosphate and when kidney function fails the levels of phosphate in the blood stream rise. Normal levels are below 2.6mmol/l. Unfortunately, high blood phosphate levels cause further kidney damage and so a vicious circle of poor kidney function leading to phosphate retention, which then causes further damage.",
                "Do a test to distinguish between kidney disease and dehydration. High levels of urea, creatinine and phosphate is a strong indication of kidney disease. However, raised results do not necessary tell the clinician whether the problem lies within the kidney (i.e. true kidney failure) or if the kidney is under strain because of another condition such as dehydration.\n\n\nTo investigate whether the problem is pre-renal (caused by dehydration) or renal, the clinician often suggests rehydrating the cat by putting her on an intravenous drip for 2-3 days, and then repeating the blood tests at the end of this time.\nIf in the fully rehydrated cat the results are now normal, this indicates the kidney is probably functioning normally but was under severe stress. If however the results remain raised in the hydrated cat, kidney failure is likely.",
                "Perform a kidney biopsy only if renal cancer is suspected. Kidney biopsy plays a limited role in the diagnosis of kidney failure. The main indication for kidney biopsy is when renal cancer is suspected, in which case a definitive diagnosis as to the type of cancer can indicate whether chemotherapy would be beneficial or not.\n\n\nThe majority of renal cancers present with either large kidneys, or kidneys with knobbly surfaces – which contrasts sharply with the small, smooth feel of kidneys with renal failure.\nWith the exception of kidney cancer, most causes of renal failure are treated in the same way. Putting the cat through the extra stress of an anesthetic and a surgical procedure in order to reach a precise diagnosis which is largely of academic interest is therefore not warranted."

            "intro": "In the 60s and 70s there was a major backlash against the creative and sexual repression of the 40s and 50s. Young people across the U.S. embraced what was called the hippie movement, which aimed to break conformity, promote peace, and spread social consciousness.[1] Today, the word hippie is well known, but actually becoming one as a teenager can be difficult if you don’t know what you’re doing. Being a hippie encompasses a lot more than what you look like or the bands you listen to. It requires a complete change in perspective and a greater propensity for understanding and love.",
            "steps": [
                "Grow your hair to shoulder length. Growing your hair long is a popular hairstyle among hippies. For men, having long hair is sometimes not acceptable in the corporate world, and as a hippie you should embrace the counter culture.[2]\n\nDreadlocks are also another hair option for hippies.\nHippies originally grew their hair long in protest against the Vietnam War and as a symbol of rebellion against the cultural norms of the 40’s and the 50’s[3]",
                "Avoid using cosmetics or personal care items that use harmful chemicals. Certain hair products, like aerosol cans, are bad for the environment, which doesn’t align with the hippie lifestyle.[4] Being natural is essential to being a hippie, and certain cosmetics or personal care items like moisturizers or shampoos contain harmful chemicals, so make sure to read the labels before purchasing your products.[5]\n\nSome hair products are animal tested which also goes against hippie ideals.[6]\n\nPopular brand such as Clinique, Lancôme Paris, L’Oréal, Clarins, and Revlon contain harmful toxins that destroy essential bacteria in soil.[7]",
                "Purchase your clothes from a thrift shop or second hand store. Being a hippie also means going against the capitalist machine, and this includes not caring about brands or tags on clothes. Find a local thrift store in your area instead of going to a chain outlet or a mall. Look for earth tones or tie dye, so you can achieve a hippie look.\n\n\nYou can buy more clothes than you normally would, since clothes at second hand stores are usually significantly discounted.\nHemp based clothing is a common favorite for many hippies.\nBaja hoodies, sometimes referred to as “drug rugs,” are common garb for hippies.[8]",
                "Buy a pair of aviator or round sunglasses. As a person who is always one with nature, it’s likely you’ll be spending most of your time outside. Make sure to get a pair of fashionable sunglasses to really exude your hippie aura. Round and aviator sunglasses are usually the type that hippies like to wear.[9]\n\nDon’t get your sunglasses taken away at school if it’s against the policy.\nJohn Lennon, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix made round, tinted glasses, popular in the early 70’s.[10]",
                "Don’t shave your body hair. As a man, it may be standard practice to keep your body hair intact, but cultural norms set for women often have them shaving their armpits, and legs.\n\n\nAs a hippie, you need rebel against the archaic and misogynistic ideals that are placed on people.",
                "Avoid all processed food and food with chemical additives. Not all hippies are vegan or vegetarian, but being a hippie means having respect for your own body and this begins with the food you eat.[11] Avoid processed foods like fast food or microwaveable dinners, and try to eat more vegetables and fresh fruit.\n\n\nHave a conversation with your parents about making healthier food choices, and explain how natural and healthy eating is important to you.\nYou can join a local food co-op if you are struggling to find healthy food in your area, or your parents refuse to buy healthy foods.\nGrowing fresh herbs or vegetables in a garden is a good idea if you want to regularly eat like a hippie.\nPack your lunch instead of buying processed food at the school cafeteria.",
                "Volunteer at local organization that is involved with environmental activism. Hippies originated the pro-earth movement, and created Earth Day in 1970.[12] Try volunteering at a local environmental activism nonprofit in your area, or donate to an environmental cause if you have extra money.\n\n\nOn the first Earth Day, 20 million Americans participated in peaceful demonstrations across the U.S.[13]\n\nYour local community center will probably have opportunities to volunteer in a garden.",
                "Act relaxed, stay positive, and go with the flow. Hippies aren’t bothered by everyday problems like other people are. Instead of ruminating on the negative, hippies always try to see the positive in every situation.\n\n\nBeing a pacifist and practicing non-violence is also another hippie belief.\nIf you’re the type to get worked up emotionally during conflict, practice meditating or doing yoga.",
                "Attend outdoor festivals to become part of the hippie community. Take every opportunity to attend outdoor festivals and talk to other hippies. Search the web for festivals happening around you, and ask your parents if you can attend. See if any of your friends want to go with you, so you don’t have to go alone.\n\n\nThere are different kinds of outdoor festivals including music festivals, outdoor film festivals, and art festivals.[14]\n\nMake sure to check if the festival is for your age. Many of them are 18 or 21 and over.",
                "Read up on revolutionaries and activists of the past. Hippies protested the Vietnam War, and are inherently against injustice. Many hippies of the 60’s and 70’s were also involved in the Civil Rights movement in America. Educate yourself on revolutionaries like Martin Luther King Jr, Che Guevara, and Mahatma Gandhi, to get a better understanding of what it’s like to be a socially aware hippie.\n\n\nIn 1967 100,000 people protested in Washington D.C. against the Vietnam War.[15]\n\nYou can participate in peaceful protests in your city around raising the minimum wage, environmental justice, or any other cause that is important to you.",
                "Listen to psychedelic rock, jam bands, and folk music. Music is a massive part of the hippie lifestyle, and many hippies listen to a pretty specific type of music. Luckily, it’s easy to find contemporary bands that take cues from bands that existed during the 60s and 70s.\n\n\nPopular hippie musicians include The Beatles, Mamas & Papas, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Neil Young.\nModern hippies will often listen to electronic dance music at outdoor festivals.",
                "Research Eastern Philosophy online or at a library. Eastern philosophy heavily influences hippie ideals, leading many hippies to explore religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American mysticism.[16] While it’s not necessary for you to change your religion, it’s important that you have an understanding and respect for these practices and belief systems.\n\n\nSpiritual exploration and acceptance of other cultures and beliefs is a common hippie trait.",
                "Educate yourself on psychedelic drugs. While you should never take illegal drugs, it’s important to know that psychedelic drugs influenced art and music for the hippie movement.[17] Read up on the effects of LSD and marijuana, as these were widely used drugs in the past.\n\n\nMany hippies use drugs to achieve a spiritual experience, not to party.[18]\n\nPopular hippie musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin died of drug overdoses.[19]"

            "intro": "Cast iron is much beloved by serious chefs for its even heating and non-stick surface. And cast iron lasts nearly forever if you take care of it. Seasoning cast iron cookware is necessary to maintain its ongoing non-stick surface and to prevent the pot or pan from rusting. If seasoned correctly, your cast iron cookware can last a lifetime.",
            "steps": [
                "Place the cookware in a self-cleaning oven. Run one cycle. Alternatively, place in a campfire or directly on a hot charcoal fire for 1/2 hour, and heat until it turns a dull red. The crust will be flaking, falling and turning to white ash. After allowing the cookware to cool a bit (to avoid cracking the cast iron), use the following steps.\n\nIf you have more rust than crust, try using steel wool to sand it off.",
                "Wash the cast iron cookware with warm water and soap. Scrub using a scouring pad.\n\nIf you have purchased your cast iron cookware as new, then it will be coated in wax or an oily coating to prevent rust. This will need to be removed before seasoning so this step is essential. Soak in hot, soapy water for five minutes, then wash off the soap and air dry.[1]",
                "Dry the cookware thoroughly. It helps to put the pan in the oven at 350F for a few minutes to make sure it's really dry. Oil needs to be able to soak into the metal for a good seasoning and––oil and water don't mix.",
                "Coat the pot or pan inside and out with lard, Crisco (cooking fat), bacon fat, or corn oil. Over time, oils will make your pan sticky. Bacon fat is the best choice. Ensure that both sides of the lid are also coated.",
                "Place both the lid and the pot or pan upside down in the oven at a high temperature (300ºF to 500ºF/150ºC-260ºC, depending on your preference). Heat for at least an hour to bake on a \"seasoning\" cover that will continue to protect the pan from rust and provide a stick-resistant surface.\n\nPlace a sheet of aluminum foil or a large disposable foil roaster under the pan, on a lower rack or on the bottom of the oven, to catch drippings.\nLet cool to room temperature in the oven.",
                "Repeat. For best results, repeat steps three and four and five.",
                "Maintain the cast iron with ongoing care. Every time you wash your cast iron cookware, season it without fail.\n\nPlace the cast iron cookware on the stove and pour in about a 3/4 teaspoon of corn oil (or other cooking fat).\nWad up a paper towel and spread the oil across the cooking surface, any bare iron surfaces, and the bottom of the cookware.\nTurn on the burner and heat until smoke starts to appear.\nIf using an electric stove, heat slowly as hot spots can crack the cast iron.\nCover the cookware and turn heat off. Leave until cooled before placing in storage. Wipe off any excess fat before storing. If your cast iron gets sticky from using oil instead of bacon fat, use it over a campfire to make some bacon or other item which renders pig fat, and the stickiness will burn off.",
                "Use the self cleaning oven to strip down the cast iron cookware. Place the utensil in your self cleaning oven on the shortest cleaning cycle (usually 3 hours on most models). It will come out looking like the day it came out of the mold.\n\nAllow it to cool overnight.\nWash the residue off with water only in the sink, using a stiff abrasive pad.\nDry the cast iron utensil off with a paper towel, and immediately place the cookware back in the oven at 350ºF/180ºC for 10 minutes or so.",
                "Take the utensil out of the oven after the 10 minute drying time is complete. Lightly brush the utensil with a paper towel coated with Crisco (or other solid cooking oil). Liquid vegetable oil will do in a pinch, but it's better to save the liquids until after the initial seasoning.\n\nIt is important in this step only to lightly coat the cast iron with a thin coating of oil, just enough until it barely glistens. Do not allow any puddles or pools of liquid as this will cause problems at a later time.",
                "Place the cast iron cookware in the oven. Set to 500ºF to 550ºF/260ºC to 290ºC degrees. Have the cooking side of the cookware facing the bottom of the oven. This allows for any excess oil to drain off to the sides, and prevents pooling during the seasoning process.\n\nThe higher heating temperatures allow for the oil to truly \"cook\" as opposed to just \"gumming up\" at lower temperatures. Cook undisturbed for 1 hour.\nNote: During this step, it will be best to turn off any smoke alarms in the immediate area as the cookware may smoke quite a lot. Ceiling fans also aid in ventilation.",
                "Finally, after the cast iron cookware is finished seasoning for 1 hour or so, take it out of the oven. Immediately wipe it down with another extra-light coating of Crisco. Allow it to completely cool before storing."

            "intro": "Although you might view your fast food job as less than ideal, there are many ways to make the most of working in the service industry. Learn as much as possible in your position; customer service skills, stress management abilities, and knowledge of specialized tasks are all assets that may serve a future job hunt. Focus on the flexible hours, social interaction, fast pace, and other perks of your job to stay positive. In addition, use all resources at your disposal in this service position to build your resume and further your career.",
            "steps": [
                "Build your customer service skills. Customer service is a very important part of the fast food industry, and a skill that will serve you well in all future jobs and endeavors. Knowing how to deal with difficult people in an appeasing matter, even when said people are in the wrong, is a strength that is applicable to both your personal life and professional life. To improve your customer service skills, try to:\n\n\nbe friendly and polite[1]\n\napologize for any delays or errors[2]\n\nsmile",
                "Learn to deal with stress. Working in a fast food environment can be stressful and chaotic, but learning how to deal with that kind of pressure is an invaluable lesson. Prioritizing tasks, recognizing what's worth stress and what isn't, and seeing stressors as a finite things are good ways to adapt.[3] Learning how to breathe, stay calm, and collect yourself is important to both your job performance and health.[4]",
                "Ask to learn new tasks. To learn as much as possible from your fast food job, ask your manager or supervisor if you can learn new tasks. This will show your initiative and enthusiasm, and it will also broaden your work experience and skills. New tasks may include:\n\n\ntaking inventory[5]\n\npreparing side dishes, like salads or soups[6]\n\noperating cooking equipment[7]\n\nreplenishing supplies[8]",
                "Appreciate the flexibility. Since fast food restaurants are open all week, typically for many hours a day, employee work schedules are usually flexible.[9] This industry is especially accommodating to employees who want extra hours, an opportunity that is not always available with a strict 9 to 5 schedule. Take advantage of the opportunity to work at different times of the day and request shifts outside of typical work day hours; this will allow you to avoid rush hour hassles, and possibly cut down the time of your commute.[10]",
                "Enjoy the social interaction. Working in the service industry provides you with an opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. You're likely learning how to read people, which is a valuable skill; additionally, the camaraderie and fun you may develop with your fellow employees doesn't exist in all working environments. Social interaction is a crucial part of human life and is thought to be a factor in extending lifespan.[11] To bond with co-workers, try:\n\n\norganizing after-work outings\nsitting with them during your breaks\nparticipating in team-building activities sponsored by the company (charity events, sports, etc.)[12]\n\nstarting discussions about workplace experiences (e.g. \"I just served a really difficult customer. How do you deal with that kind of situation?\")",
                "Welcome the fast pace. Most jobs are stationary - in other words, many people have desk jobs where they are required to sit for long periods of time. Sitting for too many consecutive hours on a regular basis can result in neck and back pain, an increased risk of heart disease, poor posture, and difficulty concentrating.[13] To avoid getting overwhelmed by the fast pace of your fast food job, take advantage of your break time to regroup, relax, and focus on your breathing.[14] Having a job that requires physical activity not only makes the time pass quickly, but it keeps your body active.\n\n\nMake sure to take care of your feet; buy a pair of comfortable shoes and breathable socks to prevent injury and hygiene issues while you're on your feet for long periods of time.[15]",
                "Make the best of working on holidays. While working on holidays is an unfortunate reality of fast food employees, there are positive things to consider. Working on days that you would prefer not to shows dedication, loyalty, and professionalism - qualities that will earn you recognition from your supervisors. In addition, postponing your own celebrations will allow you to celebrate during off-peak times, which can be less hectic and expensive.[16]",
                "Don’t let angry customers get you down. Working in the service industry means that you will inevitably encounter angry or rude customers from time to time. Remember that this is part of your job and not something that you should take to heart; customers don’t know you personally, they can only speak to their experience of the product or service you are providing. Do your best to handle each difficult situation in the best, most professional way you can and, if possible, take a few minutes to yourself if a situation really gets you down.[17]",
                "Do what you can with a lower salary. One of the biggest disadvantages of working at a fast food restaurant is the low wage you are likely to be earning. Do what you can to make the most of your money; work out a firm budget for your spending, open an account at a bank with low fees, and shop around for a high-interest savings account. These efforts to bolster your savings will make a difference over time.[18]\n\nYou may also take advantage of the non-monetary rewards of your fast food job, like free or discounted food and drinks.",
                "Consider your employer's management training program. Completing a training program has the potential to increase your income and benefits.[19] Ask your manager or supervisor about such opportunities, or do your own research on your employer's website. Keep in mind that some fast food restaurants promote their service staff to management positions; do your best to be a model employee and express interest in advancing your career with the company.[20]",
                "Build your resume. You'll acquire important skills by taking on more responsibility - experience as a supervisor is applicable anywhere. A strong work ethic, dependability, and motivation are all skills that are highly valued by prospective employers, and all of these qualities can be learned from your fast food job.[21] The more skills and experience you obtain, the more your resume is likely to impress future employers.",
                "Think about your education. Keep in mind that some fast food franchises offer scholarships and grants to their employees.This initiative gives employees the opportunity to further their education and career while working at their fast food job, and helps fast food chains attract and retain workers. Visit your employer's corporate website to apply for any opportunities available to you.[22]",
                "Look into your employer's corporate career opportunities. Many fast food chains provide opportunities for restaurant managers to move into corporate positions. Benefits at the corporate level typically include medical, dental, profit sharing, incentive pay and recognition programs. [23] Look into your options and go for any opportunities that are available to you; it is worth the risk to move towards the kind of career you want.[24]\n\nRemember that many successful people started out in the service industry; think of your experience as preparation for bigger and better things![25]"

        "wikiHow to Use Isomalt": {
            "intro": "Makes 2.5 cups (625 ml) syrup",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare a bowl of ice water. Fill a large bowl or shallow baking dish with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of water and a handful of ice.\n\n\nNote that the bowl needs to be wide enough to fit the bottom of the saucepan you'll be using.\nYou can also use this ice water in case you accidentally burn yourself during the cooking process. If you burn yourself with the metal saucepan or the hot syrup, simply dunk the burned area into the bowl of ice water to immediately stop the damage.",
                "Combine the isomalt and water. Place the isomalt crystals in a small to medium saucepan. Pour the water into the saucepan, as well, and stir the two ingredients together with a metal spoon to combine.\n\n\nYou only need enough water to wet the isomalt. When combined at this stage, the contents of the saucepan should look like wet sand.\nIf you need to alter the amount of isomalt, make sure that you change the amount of water, too. Typically, you need three to four parts isomalt for every one part water.[1]\n\nUse distilled or filtered water. Tap water contains minerals that can cause the syrup to turn yellow or brown.\nThe saucepan and spoon should be made of stainless steel. Avoid using a wooden spoon since previously absorbed material can seep into the syrup and give it a yellow tint.[2]",
                "Boil over high heat. Set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. The contents should reach a steady boil; do not stir or disturb them until they do.\n\n\nOnce the contents reach a boil, use a nylon pastry brush to scrape excess off the sides of the pan and back into the main mixture. Do not use a natural bristle brush for this.\nAfter cleaning the side of the saucepan, attach a candy thermometer to the side. Make sure that the ball of the thermometer touches the hot syrup, not the bottom of the pan.",
                "Add food coloring at 280 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). If you want to add food coloring to the isomalt syrup, this is the ideal temperature to do so. Add the number of drops needed to achieve your desired color depth, then stir the food coloring into the boiling syrup using a metal mixing spoon or skewer.\n\n\nDon't worry if the mixture gets stuck at around 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) for a little while. At this temperature, the excess water is boiling out. The temperature will not climb further until this water boils out.\nExpect the mixture to bubble rapidly when you add the food coloring in.",
                "Cook until the syrup reaches 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171 degrees Celsius). In order to create isomalt glass or similar isomalt decorations, the liquified syrup must be allowed to reach this temperature. If it does not, the structure of the isomalt may not be altered enough to allow the decoration to set properly.\n\n\nYou should actually remove the saucepan from the heat when the thermometer reads 333 degrees Fahrenheit (167 degrees Celsius). The temperature will continue to climb after that, even if you try to quickly stop the melting process.",
                "Dunk the bottom of the pan in ice water. Once the isomalt reaches the correct temperature, quickly transfer the saucepan to your prepared dish of ice water. Stick the bottom of the pan inside the water for 5 to 10 seconds or so to stop the temperature from climbing further.\n\n\nDo not let any of the ice water get inside the saucepan.\nRemove the saucepan from the water as soon as the hissing sounds stop.",
                "Keep the isomalt warm in your oven. Isomalt pours best at about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius), so you should keep it warm in the oven until you are ready to use it to prevent the syrup from cooling too much.\n\n\nThe oven should be set to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).\nKeeping the isomalt syrup in the oven for 15 minutes will usually help it achieve its ideal pouring temperature. During this time, the bubbles will also have time to escape from the syrup.\nYou can keep isomalt in the oven for up to three hours. If you store it longer, the mixture can begin to yellow.",
                "Place the nibs in a microwave-safe bowl. Make sure that they are evenly spread out to promote even melting.\n\n\nIf using isomalt sticks instead of nibs, break the sticks in halves or thirds before placing them in the dish.\nIsomalt nibs and sticks come in clear forms and pre-colored forms. If you want to create a colored creation, use pre-colored nibs.\nSince melted isomalt can get very hot, using a dish with a handle may make it easier and safer to handle the melted syrup. You could also use silicone baking dishes or bowls since silicone is fairly heat resistant. If you use something without a handle, however, consider placing the dish on a microwave-safe plate to limit the amount of contact you'll need to have with the dish itself.",
                "Microwave on high, working in 15 to 20 second increments.[3] You will need to stir the isomalt nibs after each increment to make sure that they are heating in an even, thorough manner. Continue microwaving them in this manner until the entire batch has been melted down.\n\n\nNote that air bubbles will naturally form as the isomalt melts.\nUse oven mitts to protect your hands while handling a dish of hot isomalt.\nStir the melting isomalt with a metal skewer or similar utensil. Avoid wooden utensils.\nIt takes an average of one minute to melt roughly five nibs. This amount of time can vary depending on the strength of your microwave and the size of the nibs, however.",
                "Stir well. Stir the melted isomalt one last time to remove as many air bubbles as possible.\n\n\nYou must make sure that all of the bubbles are out of the melted isomalt before you try to use it. If there are bubbles in the syrup, there will be bubbles in the finished decoration.",
                "Reheat as needed. If the isomalt begins to harden or set before you have a chance to use it, you can simply reheat it in the microwave by putting the dish in and reheating it in additional intervals of 15 to 20 seconds.\n\n\nYou should be able to let the melted isomalt sit out for up to 5 or 10 minutes before it starts cooling.\nIf additional bubbles begin to form, stir the isomalt to help release them.",
                "Coat the molds with cooking spray. Spray an even layer of nonstick cooking spray into each mold, giving each one a thorough, even coat.[4]\n\nUse a dry paper towel to clean off excess cooking spray from the top of the molds.\nMake sure that the molds you use are labeled for use with isomalt or sugar-based hard candy. The high temperatures you'll be working with could melt molds that are not durable enough.",
                "Transfer the syrup into a pastry bag, if desired.[5] Only add about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of melted isomalt to the pastry bag.\n\n\nAdding more could cause the bag to weaken or melt. Adding too much can also cause burns.\nUsing pastry may can make it easier for you to work with the melted isomalt, but many find the step to be an unnecessary one.\nDo not cut off the tip of the pastry bag before adding the isomalt. Leave the tip intact for now.\nMake sure that you still continue to wear oven mitts while handling the pastry bag. The heat of the melted isomalt can still burn you through the bag.",
                "Pour or squeeze the syrup into the molds. Place just enough melted isomalt into each mold compartment to fill it.\n\n\nOnly cut the tip of the pastry bag when you are ready to fill the molds. The isomalt will pour out quickly, so you'll need to be careful.\nRegardless of how you pour the melted isomalt, you should let it pour out in a thin stream. Doing so will minimize the number of bubbles that form.\nLightly tap the bottom of the mold on a counter, table, or other hard surface to release any bubbles from the syrup after you fill the molds.",
                "Let the syrup set. Depending on the size of your molds, the isomalt should harden into a stiff decoration within 5 to 15 minutes.\n\n\nOnce the isomalt cools, it should naturally pull away from the sides of the mold. You should be able to simply tip the mold on its side and watch the pieces tumble out.",
                "Use as desired. The isomalt decorations can be stored in airtight containers or used immediately.\n\n\nIf you plan on sticking the decorations to something like a cake, apply a little corn syrup or melted isomalt to the back of the decoration using a toothpick, then stick the decoration onto the cake. It should remain in place without any difficulty."

        "wikiHow to Learn a New Language Fast": {
            "intro": "Want to find out how you can learn a new language quickly, without the need for expensive classes or language learning software? There are really no secrets or shortcuts -- you just need to commit to your new language, be willing to work hard and not be afraid to make mistakes. Start with Step 1 below to find out more.",
            "steps": [
                "Connect with a native speaker. Hands down, the best way to learn a new language is to speak it. Too often, people spend all of their time studying grammar and memorizing lists of words instead of actually going out there and putting what they've learned into practice. Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.\n\n\nTry to find a friend or colleague who speaks the language you wish to learn and who'd be willing to sit down with you and help you practice. Alternatively, you could try putting ads in local online forums or newspapers to find someone to tutor you or participate in a language exchange.\nIf you can't find anyone who speaks your language nearby, try to connect with someone on Skype. People in foreign countries are often willing to exchange half an hour of speaking in their native tongue for half an hour of speaking in English. A Hellotalk account is another option.",
                "Study the language every day. People often claim to have studied a language \"for five years\" and still not be fluent. But when they say five years, they probably mean that they studied the language for only a couple of hours a week over that entire time period. Let's get one thing clear -- if you want to learn a new language quickly -- that is, in the space of a few weeks or months -- you're going to have to commit to studying the language for a couple of hours per day.\n\n\nLanguage learning is based on repetition -- hammering something into your brain over and over again until you remember it. If you break too long between study sessions, you are much more prone to forget what you learned last time and you will waste valuable study time going back over what you've already learned.\nYou can cut down on this wasted time by studying every day. There are no miraculous short cuts when it comes to language learning -- you just need to commit.",
                "Carry a dictionary at all times. Carrying a dictionary with you will save you a lot of time and frustration, so invest in one as soon as possible!\n\n\nIt can be an actual, physical dictionary, or a dictionary app on your phone -- you just need to be able to consult it quickly whenever you need a word.\nCarrying a dictionary will allow you to find the necessary word at a moments notice. This is especially important when you are having a conversation with a native speaker and don't wish to disrupt the flow of conversation by not being able to remember a word. In addition, looking up the word and using it immediately in a sentence will help you to commit the word to memory.\nYou can also peruse the dictionary at random moments throughout the day -- when you're waiting in line at the grocery store, when you're on a coffee break at work, or sitting in traffic. You could learn an extra 20 or 30 words a day this way!",
                "Watch, listen, read and write in your chosen language. Immersing yourself in a language means doing all of the activities you would normally do in your native tongue, through your new language -- whether that's reading, writing or listening.\n\n\nPossibly the easiest thing you can do is watch television shows or movies in the language you are trying to learn. Try to avoid subtitles, as you will tend to rely on them. To make things easier, try to watch shows or movies whose plots you are already familiar with -- like kids' cartoons or dubbed versions of English movies -- knowing the context will help you to decipher the meanings of words and phrases.\nYou should also attempt to read and write in your new language. Get a newspaper or magazine and attempt to read one article a day -- looking up any words you don't understand in your dictionary. You should also try to write a few simple things in your new language --whether it's a pretend postcard or a shopping list.\nDownload podcasts or tune in to radio stations in your new language. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language while you're on the go. Not only does this help with your listening comprehension, it also allows you to hear the correct pronunciation of common words and phrases.\nChange your language settings on all your electronic devices so that you can pick up words you know already in English but not in the new language.\nListen to songs in that language. Try to learn the lyrics, then check what they mean. That way, if you hear it again, you can tell what the conversation is about at that point.",
                "Visit a country where your chosen language is spoken. Obviously, it would be a great boost to your language learning skills if you could visit and spend some time in a country where your new language is spoken.\n\n\nForce yourself to interact with the locals -- whether you're asking for directions, completing a transaction in a store, or simply saying hello -- and you will gain a new appreciation of the language and its speakers.\nIt doesn't matter how basic your oral skills are, keep pushing yourself to speak and you will soon notice a vast improvement in your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.",
                "Learn a few greeting words in the language before you learn the alphabet. This way when you do learn the languages alphabet you will already know some pretty basic words. For example: Hello, Goodbye, How are you?, I am good, What is your name?, My name is____, and so on.",
                "Learn the alphabet of the language you are learning, if necessary. It will make it significantly easier for you and you will be able to read and pronounce words, which will help you memorize them with greater ease. Plus, it is better for you to be sounding the words out rather than looking at the romanization for the words.",
                "Learn vocabulary. Mastering basic vocabulary is probably one of the most important things you can do when learning a new language. Even if you can't understand whole sentences, the ability to pick out keywords can help you to understand the general meaning of a speech or text.\n\n\nFocus on 100 most common words. Picking out the most common 100 words in a given language is a clever way to start. From there, you can work your way up to the most common 1000 words. It is estimated that learning the 1000 most common words in a language will allow you to understand 70% of any text.\nFocus on the vocabulary that is most relevant to you -- learn business vocabulary if you're learning a language for business, don't waste time learning the words for different species of fish (which you might want to do if you're traveling to go scuba diving!)\nYou should also learn words and vocabulary that pertain specifically to you, so you're able to talk about your life and your background to people you meet.",
                "Learn to count in the new language. Start off by learning to count to ten, because it is usually the easiest thing to memorize at first. Each day learn a new set of ten numbers, keep going each day until you are satisfied with how high you can count. If you are up for a challenge, memorize all the numbers up to one hundred in one day.",
                "Don't worry too much about grammar. The reason why most people can't remember most of the language they spent years learning in school is that school curricula tend to focus a huge amount of time on learning grammar and very little time on speech. This is pretty much backwards -- if you want to learn a language quickly, you should learn how to converse first. The specifics of grammar will come later.\n\n\nOf course, there's no denying that grammar is important -- you need to learn how to conjugate basic everyday verbs and have some idea of the correct word order in a sentence.\nThe point is that you shouldn't spend hours and hours learning verb tables by heart, or worrying about the specific circumstances in which a certain preposition can be used. You'll learn these things as you go along!",
                "Work on pronunciation. Pronunciation is another place where you should focus your energies. There's no point in memorizing hundreds of words and phrases if you pronounce them so oddly that they can't be understood. Therefore, it's important that when you learn a word, you learn the pronunciation simultaneously.\n\n\nPronunciation can be difficult to learn from a book -- so this is where chatting with native speakers (or using interactive software programs and applications) comes in handy. You need to actually say the word out loud in order to learn how to pronounce it correctly.\nIf you're practicing with an actual person, make sure that they're not too timid to correct you when you pronounce a word incorrectly, otherwise you may never fully get the hang of it. Remember -- pronunciation can be the difference between speaking a language well and speaking a language fluently.",
                "Don't be afraid to make mistakes. When you're learning a new language you can't be afraid to make mistakes, otherwise you won't get very far.\n\n\nYou're bound to get yourself in a few embarrassing situations, but what's the big deal? The native speakers might have a good chuckle, but they'll still appreciate the effort you're making and be willing to help you out.\nYou are not aiming for perfection here, you are aiming for progress. Making mistakes (and learning from them) will help you to progress.",
                "Use Anki. Anki is a very popular software program and smartphone app that helps you to effectively memorize words and phrases using flashcards. You can upload your own deck of cards with the specific vocabulary you wish to learn, or you can download one of the many pre-existing shared decks to get started.",
                "Use Duolingo. Duolingo is a free language learning tool available online and on Android and iOS. Rather than focusing on memorization, it gets users to read and speak their new language by seeing, hearing and internalizing it. Users gain points as they complete lessons, giving Duolingo a fun, game-like feel.",
                "Use Memrise. Memrise is another flashcard-style program that allows users to memorize words and phrases using memory tricks, images and other useful tools. Memrise allows users to compete against other users as you complete language-learning activities, making it a fun, non-formal way to learn.",
                "Use Babbel. Babbel is a fun, interactive language learning tool, available online and as a mobile application. It can help users to improve their vocabulary, grammar skills and pronunciation. It can also identify your problem areas and offer targeted exercises based on your individual needs."

        "How to Become a Strong Muslim": {
            "intro": "If you are looking to affirm and live up to your Muslim identity, you can do so by focusing on your faith expression. Show pride in your identity, and seek a greater understanding of your faith. Fulfill the five pillars, and do so mindfully, devoting attention to planning your actions and completing them with attention. Convene with other Muslims, and share in efforts of fard al-kifaya at your mosque and with other groups within your community.",
            "steps": [
                "Fulfill the five pillars of Islam. Islam's Five Pillars are required for all Muslims. You must comply with them to practice Islam. To be a strong Muslim, do not waver from your observance of the pillars. Fulfill your daily obligations mindfully, and plan your occasional obligations with care. The Five Pillars are:\n\n\nTestimony of Faith (Shahada). When you become a Muslim, you make a testimony of faith. Say aloud: \"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.\"\nPerformance of the five daily prayers (Salah). Pray five times daily in the direction of the holy city of Mecca.\n\nFasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm). Ramadan is a holy month. Observe it by praying, fasting, and performing acts of charity.\nAlmsgiving. Donate 2.5% of your savings to the poor (Zakat).\nMaking a pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). If you are able, you must travel to Mecca at least once in your lifetime.",
                "Read the Qur'an as often as you can. Seek an understanding of Islam directly from the authentic source. You will strengthen your personal faith if you know the language your faith is based on. Make a practice of reading for at least a few minutes daily, as well as moments when you feel your faith waver or your focus on Allah falter.[1]\n\nEvery time you read, recite at least one verse aloud and try to perfect its pronunciation.\nTry to be mindful of Allah throughout your day as you go about your business or chores. Keeping your lips moist with dhikr helps develop an awareness of Allah's might and majesty.",
                "Pray above and beyond the mandatory requirements. While you must pray five times a day, a strong Muslim may also pray at additional times when moved to do so. You may pray alone, but to strengthen your faith, head to your mosque at prayer times. Collective worship has special merit.[2]\n\nWhile the obligatory prayers typically last only a few minutes each, you may extend your time in prayer by including additional voluntary prayers in your schedule.\nTahajjud is a very rewarding Sunnah prayer offered during the dead of night, a peaceful time when Allah descends to the lowest heaven.\nAdd your own personal prayers (dua) after the formal prayers or at any time during the day - ask Allah for help, guidance and protection, thank Him for his bounties and praise Him for His wisdom and generosity.\nRepentance is an important part of every Muslims' daily routine. Acknowledge your sins, however small, promise not to repeat them and ask Allah for His forgiveness. Allah is always inclined to forgive us, but only when we ask and when we repent with deep sincerity.\nCrying during prayer is encouraged as it signifies fear of Allah's punishment and hence leads to submission to His will.\nVary your routine so that you concentrate and feel close to Allah during the act of praying, and are not merely going through the motions. If your mind wanders you make mistakes, your prayer becomes invalidated and is not accepted.",
                "Donate time and money to the needy. While almsgiving is required of all Muslims, it is up the individual to determine what they can give beyond the required 2.5% of their income. If you are a high-earner, donate more than 2.5% of your income to good causes represented by trustworthy organizations. If you have extra time, volunteer at charity organizations. If you have special skills that can be helpful for others, such as TESOL training or knowledge of the law, consider donating your skills to non-profits and volunteer organizations that cannot afford to hire professionals.[3]",
                "Contribute to your community's fulfillment of fard al-kifaya. Fard al-kifaya are community obligations. Some of your community must fulfill fard al-kifaya for the benefit of the rest. For instance, if a Muslim dies, some of the Muslims in the community must get together to say funeral prayers. It's not required for every individual Muslims to say the prayers. However, if no one says the funeral prayers, the whole community is at fault.[4]\n\nStep forward to fill in gaps when your community is failing to fulfill fard al-kifaya.\nThink about the larger meaning of fard al-kifaya for your community. Could the Muslims in your community take on responsibilities toward feeding the hungry, repairing civic infrastructure, or participating in local politics?",
                "Stand up for yourself and other Muslims. Muslims are often portrayed negatively by various political groups to further their own ends. You don't have to engage whenever you hear an Islamophobic statement, but you should say something if you feel safe and have the energy to do so.[5]\n\nIf you hear someone conflating Islam with violent extremism, you might say, \"I am a Muslim, and I don't appreciate you assuming all Muslims condone violent actions. That's not based on fact, and saying it as if it were could have dangerous consequences for me and people I love.\"\nStand up for other Muslims if you see them being targeted. For instance, if you see a woman in a hijab being harassed, stand between her and her harasser and engage her in friendly conversation to take the power away from the person harassing her.",
                "Dress to express your faith. Most Muslims dress modestly, but the style of dress varies greatly by school of thought and by region. Consider your circumstances and dress in a way that expresses your religious belief.[6]\n\nEven if your family does not dress in this way, you may choose to wear long sleeves, a hijab or even niqab to more clearly express your identity.\nIf you do not wear any easily-recognizable symbols of Islam, consider wearing a button or using a bumper sticker with a pro-Islam message.\nTake care of yourself. If you live somewhere where you are at physical risk for showing (or failing to show) your faith, make the compromises you need to stay safe.",
                "Join or start an affinity group. Consider joining a youth group, a volunteer collective, or a meet-up group for other Muslims. Check your Mosque to see if there are groups you can join. If you are in school, there are often affinity groups for Muslim students, or inter-faith groups other Muslim students have joined.\n\n\nEncourage each other to extend and deepen your knowledge of Islam, so that you can better understand how Allah wishes to be worshiped.\nObserve holidays together, go to meetings, and organize protests, celebrations, and other events in your community.\nForm letter-writing committees to contact your local politicians about legislation that would affect other Muslims, such as refugees from Muslim-majority countries."

        "wikiHow to Treat a Wound Created by an Impaled Object": {
            "intro": "How you treat a wound caused by being impaled by an object differs depending upon the severity of the wound. If the object is small and only in the surface of the skin, you can remove and clean it yourself. But if it is deeply embedded, do not remove it. Call emergency responders immediately.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Call emergency responders if the object is deep. If the object is large or deeply embedded in the skin or muscle, removing it may cause additional damage. It may also cause the person to bleed severely. Call an ambulance for severe injuries such as:[2]\n\nGunshot wounds\nKnife wounds\nConstruction accidents\nAny penetrating injury\nInjuries from metal or glass caused by a car accident\nInjuries to an eye\nInjuries that are deep and dirty",
                "Control the bleeding while you wait for an ambulance. If you are bleeding heavily, try to prevent yourself from losing too much blood. If possible, you can do this by:[3]\n\n\nNot removing the object. Doing so may cause the bleeding to increase and should be done by a doctor. Instead, you can try to reduce the bleeding by pressing around the object. Be careful not to push the object deeper inside, but to instead try to hold the edges of the wound together.\nElevating the wound above the heart. If the wound occurred on an arm or leg, lie down. Prop the arm or leg up on a pile of pillows.",
                "Stabilize the object in the wound. If the object is large and heavy, such as a knife or other object that may move, it needs to be kept still. If the object moves inside you, it may do additional damage. You can stabilize the object by carefully bandaging the wound.[4]\n\nBuild up a layer of support around the object using clean gauze that is rolled to increase stability. Tape across the rolled gauze in a \"log cabin\" method (horizontal lines of tape overlapping at ninety degree angles). This will give the support much needed height to increase stabilization.",
                "Monitor yourself for shock. Losing a lot of blood can cause a person to go into shock. Shock can be fatal because the circulatory system fails to deliver blood and oxygen to the person’s organs.[5]\n\nThe following symptoms are signs of shock: Paleness; cold, clammy skin; fast, shallow breathing; vomiting; yawning and sighing; thirst.\nIf you think you (or someone you are treating) are going into shock, call emergency responders and update them on the situation. If you can, lie down and raise your legs above your head. Cover yourself so you will stay warm and ask someone to talk to you to keep you awake. Do not eat or drink anything.",
                "Follow the instructions when the ambulance arrives. Depending upon the severity of your wound, you may be transported to a hospital and treated there. Tell the medical staff as much as you remember about how the injury occurred.\n\n\nAfter you are treated, your doctor may recommend you get a tetanus shot if it has been more than five years since you had one or if the wound was dirty.[6]",
                "Protect yourself from diseases if you are treating someone else. Blood can transmit infectious diseases such as HIV. The best way to protect yourself and the injured person, is to wear protective gear. This protects you from any diseases they may have and protects them from any diseases you may have.[7]\n\nWear latex gloves if you will be touching a bloody wound.\nWear masks, eye and face shields, and protective aprons if there are splashes of blood.\nWash your hands after you remove the gloves. Wash all surfaces that came in contact with blood or other bodily fluids.\nIf the person was injured with a sharp object, be careful not to cut yourself as you treat the wound.\nIf at any point your protective gear becomes compromised while you treat another person, take a moment to replace it.",
                "Wash the wound. Use clean soap and water to wash your hands and the area around the small embedded object, wiping away from the site of the injury. This will minimize the risk that you will introduce dirt and bacteria into the wound as you remove the object.[8]\n\nExamine the wound to verify that the object is just beneath the surface of the skin. Chances are you will be able to see it and feel it. If it is a splinter of wood, it may even be poking out slightly. If possible, use a magnifying glass to help you see exactly how it is positioned in your skin.",
                "Sterilize a set of tweezers. You can do this by wiping them with rubbing alcohol. The alcohol will evaporate immediately afterwards.[9]\n\nThe alcohol does not need to be washed off.",
                "Grip the object with the tweezers. Gently pull it out using the same path through which it entered. Pull firmly but gently.\n\n\nDo not make sudden jerky movements or twist the object. Doing so will make the wound larger.\nIf the object is difficult to remove, soaking the site in warm saline water or water with a splash of vinegar for a few minutes can help the object to work its way to the surface.",
                "Wash the wound again after the object has been removed. This will clean the area where the object was. Run the wound under clean water and gently wash it with soap.\n\n\nInspect the wound to make sure there are no foreign particles left in the wound.\nGently dry the wound. Do not scrub hard because once the wound has been cleaned, you want to allow it to close and heal.",
                "Apply an over-the-counter topical antibiotic ointment. This will help prevent infection. These ointments (Neosporin, Polysporin) are available at local pharmacies.[10]\n\nCover the wound with a bandage. This will prevent dirt and bacteria from getting into the wound as it heals.\nMonitor the wound for signs of infection. If the pain increases or the wound swells, becomes hot, turns red, or leaks pus, call your doctor.",
                "Check when you had your last tetanus shot. If the wound was dirty, you may want to call your doctor and ask whether you should get a booster.[11]\n\nWhen you call, explain that you had a wound which you are concerned about. Tell the doctor when your last tetanus shot was.",
                "Purchase materials for changing the dressing. If your wound has a bandage over it, you may need to change it and clean the wound regularly during healing. You can buy the supplies you will need at your local pharmacy. Your doctor should be able to give you a list of what you will need. This may include: [12]\n\nSterile gauze\nTape\nAdhesive bandages or elastic bandages\nAntibacterial soap/surgical soap",
                "Change the bandage at least once per day. If the bandage gets wet or dirty, change it right away. This will help prevent infection.[13]\n\nFollow your doctor's instructions for washing the wound, applying any medications, and bandaging it.\nIf you are worried about your ability to take care of the wound properly, ask your doctor about visiting nurses services. It may be possible for a nurse to visit you daily to change the bandage.",
                "Inspect the wound for signs of infection. Each time you change the bandage, examine the wound closely to see if it is healing. Call the doctor right away if you notice any of the following signs that it may be becoming infected:[14]\n\nIncreasing pain\nRedness\nSwelling\nHeat\nDraining pus or other fluids\nThrobbing at the wound site\nRed streaks radiating from wound site"

        "wikiHow to Follow the Paleo Diet": {
            "intro": "The \"Paleolithic\" or \"Paleo\" diet (also sometimes referred to as the \"Caveman Diet\") is based on the idea that our bodies are better adapted to what our human ancestors ate during the Paleolithic era. While we don't have the predators, caves, and short lifespan of the caveman to contend with, the reality is that many of the foods we consume today aren't very healthy for us. For some, a return to eating like cavemen is a way of restoring a balance. When done well, the paleo diet involves a change in lifestyle that can help you lose weight and become more active.",
            "steps": [
                "Set your paleo goals. Supporters of the paleo diet believe that by recreating the way humans ate during the Stone Age, they can recreate a healthy lifestyle. Following the paleo diet can help you lose weight, control blood pressure, and manage your appetite.[1] If you have different dietary or health concerns, the paleo diet may not be for you.\n\n\nA change in lifestyle, even something as simple as your diet, can mean a major shift in your personal life. Knowing what you want to accomplish can help keep you motivated and on track.",
                "Prepare your kitchen. The paleo diet involves eating more fresh meats and vegetables, so you'll need somewhere suitable to store them. Make sure you have ample freezer space for meat, and a refrigerator to keep vegetables cool.\n\n\nCooking paleo meals does not require specialized equipment, so you should not need to purchase additional pots, pans, or appliances beyond what you already own.\nEquip yourself with a comprehensive cooking or recipe book specifically for the paleo diet.",
                "Base your diet on meats. These can be red meat, pork, poultry, venison, eggs, or any other kind of meat. Meat for a paleo diet should be grass-fed, not corn-fed. This distinction is more important than the particular type of meat you choose. It better re-creates the conditions cavemen would have found their food, and avoids the sugars found in modern animal feed.\n\n\nFish and other seafood are also good meats to include. These contain healthy Omega 3 oils. Fish for the paleo diet should be wild, and not farm-raised.[2]\n\nFor each meal, a serving size of protein should be 4 – 8 ounces, or approximately one to two palm-sized pieces. You can eat a little more or a little less depending on factors such as your own weight or hunger level, but each meal should stay in that range.[3]",
                "Incorporate vegetables, especially leafy green ones, and fruits. Vegetables provide most of the fiber and carbohydrates that you will get on the paleo diet. Fruits will provide the natural sugars your body needs. These should be fresh, not dried, fruits. Most fruits that fit with the ethos of the paleo diet (that is, eaten by cavemen) contain much less sugar than most fruits available today.[4]\n\nIf you are diabetic, or have other restrictions on sugar intake, it may be better to avoid sweeter fruits including grapes, bananas, mangos, sweet cherries, apples, pineapples, pears and kiwi fruit, especially early in the diet.\nYour daily intake of fruits and vegetables should be at least nine servings (about 4 1/2 cups).[5] You can spread these over your daily meals to best suit your appetite and menu.",
                "Use nuts and seeds for snacking or garnish on recipes. Remember that peanuts are not nuts (they are legumes), so instead focus on actual nuts like almonds, cashews, pine nuts, pecans, and walnuts. Unsalted pumpkin or sunflower seeds are also good. These make good snacks, but make sure you avoid salted and processed nuts. It is better to avoid snacking altogether, but nuts are the best choice.[6][7]\n\nYou can also use almond flour or coconut flours for many recipes.",
                "Use natural oils when cooking. These should be natural, such as olive, walnut, flaxseed, macadamia, avocado, and coconut oils, all of which are sources of good fat. They are great for marinating meat, or providing a base for frying meats and vegetables.[8]\n\nEach meal should include approximately one to two thumb-sized servings of fat, and oils are a good source of that.[9]",
                "Limit dairy intake. Dairy products are a gray area for paleo practitioners. Most paleo diets restrict dairy completely, as the introduction of regular dairy came much later in human history, and consuming dairy involves a large dose of carbohydrates in the form of lactose. In addition, modern dairy products come from cows fed with corn and other hormones, and are heavily pasteurized to remove fat. If you want to consume more of a \"primal\" diet, include dairy products such as full fat dairy like yogurt and butter from grass-fed cows.[10][11]",
                "Control your intake. The paleo diet does not require you to eat meals on a set schedule. Instead, you eat when you are hungry. You certainly can eat three regular meals a day. If you are not hungry, though, you do not need to eat simply because it is time for a meal.[12]\n\nSome paleo followers like to fast for extended periods between meals to better simulate the irregular eating schedule Stone Age humans would have followed. This is certainly not a necessary part of the diet, and being paleo does not have to mean fasting. The most important thing is eating the proper foods.[13]",
                "Start a paleo recipe collection. When you first start out, it's likely you'll still be able to use some of your cookbooks for basics such as salads and roasting. However, you'll be confronted fairly quickly by all the elements you can't use, such as salt and processed items. Expand your repertoire of caveman recipes and explore the many possibilities by building on the basics.\n\n\nGo through your existing cookbooks and adapt the recipes. You might like to compile a single book in a folder or in digital form to make it easier to refer to daily.\nSearch online for caveman food websites and blogs. There are also books available for purchase about the caveman diet – take a visit to your local bookstore. Popular websites include: Nom Nom Paleo, PaleoOMG, and RobbWolf.com.",
                "Don't be completely tied to the scheduled diet. Cutting out grains and processed foods can be very difficult in the modern world, especially at first. Eating a slice of bread will not ruin your diet, and doesn't make you a failure. That being said, if you are not seeing results, you may want to reevaluate your diet and see if you are cheating a bit too much.\n\n\nSome paleo dieters set aside a day during the week to eat whatever they want. This can help create better discipline throughout the rest of the week.[14]\n\nIf you're going to add a cheat food as a treat, use something filling and nutritious, such as a teaspoon of peanut butter on a banana, rather than grabbing a handful of cookies.",
                "Drink lots of water. Water is really the only approved paleo drink, and it can be especially helpful to keep your body functioning, especially given you will likely consuming additional protein. If water isn't enough, you can include an occasional cup of herbal tea or freshly squeezed fruit juice. Avoid sodas and processed fruit juices.[15]",
                "Supplement your diet with occasional vitamins. While the modern paleo diet can supply most of the necessary nutrients, there are some potential weaknesses. If you are not getting all of these proper nutrients, consider additional supplements.[16]\n\nVitamin D. Unless your diet is rich in wild fish, and you get plenty of sunlight, you may need a Vitamin D supplement.\nOmega-3 Fish Oil. In general, you will want to maintain balance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 oils. Unless you are fully paleo, 1 to 2 grams of high quality fish oil daily, containing Omega-3 oil, is a good supplement.\nProbiotics. Western or vegetarian diets can sometimes damage the necessary bacteria in your stomach. When starting the diet, you may need to supplement what you eat with strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.",
                "Exercise. At its core, the paleo diet is about changing your lifestyle, not just your meals. Even something as simple as walking as much as possible can be helpful to losing weight and getting the most out of your diet. Paleo exercise involves natural movements (preferably without too much gym equipment) and occasional strength training.[17]\n\nAvoid extensive cardio workouts. These put extra pressure on your body, and require more carbohydrates.\n\nCrossfit is a common exercise program for paleo dieters, and can be helpful for people looking for a more intense workout. Crossfit gyms are also a good place to meet other paleo dieters.",
                "Consider a paleo diet if you're generally healthy. Under most circumstances, the paleo diet presents very few health risks and is generally safe for most people to follow. It relies heavily on good sources of nutrients, including lean meats, vegetables, fruits, and nuts.[18]\n\nThe absence of whole grains, legumes, and dairy products will deprive you of some nutrients found in traditionally balanced diets, however, so a paleo diet may not be best for you if you have special requirements for fiber, calcium, or other vitamins and minerals.\nAdditionally, a paleo diet will be unsafe to follow if you have a vegetarian or vegan diet since soy and legumes--important sources of vegetarian protein--are not allowed.\nIf you have any previously known medical conditions, you should consult your doctor before attempting a paleo diet or any other major dietary change. In particular, those with heart, kidney, liver, or pancreatic disease may risk worsening their conditions by following a paleo diet.[19]",
                "Try a paleo diet after consulting with your doctor. Even though a paleo diet will generally be safe for most people who do not have previously known medical concerns, it's always advisable to consult with a doctor or nutritionist before making a major change to your diet like this.[20]\n\nYour doctor can work with you to determine if a paleo diet is right for your medical needs. Additionally, your doctor or nutritionist can help track the progress you make while following a paleo diet.",
                "Follow a paleo diet for short-term weight management. Several clinical trials lasting 12 weeks or less suggest that following a paleo diet may make it easier to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, these studies also suggest better short-term glucose tolerance and blood pressure control.[21]\n\nNote that longer clinical trials are still needed to assess the long-term risks and benefits.\nThere are some concerns that following a paleo diet long-term may result in higher levels of LDL cholesterol. The lack of calcium may also increase your osteoporosis risk, and the reduction of carbohydrates may result in ketosis.[22]\n\nAdditionally, following a restrictive diet like the paleo diet can be difficult to do for prolonged periods of time.",
                "Plan on paying more for your food. While a paleo diet can be beneficial, it can also be more expensive since it largely promotes organic, grass-fed meats and other less accessible foods. If you plan on following a paleo diet, do so when your finances are balanced and budgeted for the extra expense.[23]",
                "Remain willing to adapt. The scientific community still questions many of the underlying beliefs forming the basis of the paleo diet. While many of the foods restricted in this diet have been tied to health problems, many researchers still argue that the paleo diet could oversimplify dietary needs.[24]\n\nTry the paleo diet for several months and evaluate your health both during and after. If the diet improves your health and your doctor concludes that it's safe for you to continue, it might be worth continuing. On the other hand, if you experience health concerns while following a paleo diet, be prepared to adapt or abandon it altogether for something more suited to your own needs."

        "wikiHow to Get Rid of an Itchy Sunburn (Fair Skin)": {
            "intro": "Along with redness, peeling, and pain, sunburns can also cause itchiness. A sunburn damages the top layer of your skin, which is full of the nerve fibers that are responsible for that itching sensation. The sun damage causes the nerves to fire, making you feel itchy until the burn has healed.[1] In the meantime, you can use home remedies or over the counter or prescription medications to relieve the itching and let your skin heal.",
            "steps": [
                "Seek medical advice for severe burns. Home remedies can be helpful, but they're usually intended to treat mild burns. If you are experiencing blistering, dizziness, fever, or possible infection (draining pus, red streaks, increased tenderness),[2] you should contact your doctor before treating the sunburn yourself.\n\n\nIf you or a friend are feeling weak and unable to stand, confused, or passes out, you should call an ambulance.\nSkin that is waxy and white, very dark brown, or raised and leathery are signs of a third degree burn. It is very rare, but it is sometimes possible to suffer a burn this severe from the sun. Seek medical help immediately.[3]",
                "Spray the sunburn with apple cider vinegar. Vinegar is a weak acid that is sometimes used as an antiseptic. It balances your skin's pH, which in turn promotes faster healing and can relieve itchiness.[4] Vinegar does have a strong smell, but it should dissipate after a few minutes.\n\n\nFill a clean spray bottle with apple cider vinegar. Test it by first spraying it on a small area of sunburned skin and wait to see if you experience pain or any kind of reaction.\nSpray the vinegar on the sunburned skin, allowing it to drip-dry. Do not rub it into your skin.\nReapply if your skin begins to itch again.\nIf you don't have a spray bottle, pour a few drops on a cotton ball or washcloth and dab it on the sunburn.[5]\n\nSome claim regular white vinegar as the same effect as apple cider, so you can try using that instead of apple cider vinegar if none is available.[6]",
                "Take a warm oatmeal bath. Oatmeal moisturizes dry skin and will normalize the skin’s pH, which is often at a high level when skin is dry and itchy.[7] You can use colloidal oatmeal, which is ground and will float in the bathwater, increasing the exposure to your skin. Otherwise you can put 3/4 cup uncooked oatmeal in a clean pair of panty hose and tie or knot it.[8]\n\nRun a lukewarm bath (hot water may dry out your skin and cause more itching).[9]\n\nAdd the colloidal oatmeal to the running water so it mixes completely. If you are using the stocking, toss it into the bath at this time.[10]\n\nSoak for about 10 minutes. If you feel sticky afterwards, rinse with lukewarm water. You can take an oatmeal bath up to three times a day.[11]\n\nMake sure you pat dry with a towel—do not rub. This can cause further irritation to your skin.[12]",
                "Treat the area with diluted peppermint oil. Available in most health stores, peppermint oil has a cooling and calming effect on skin.[13] Do not use peppermint extract--it is not the same as peppermint oil.\n\n\nDilute the peppermint oil in a carrier oil (a vegetable oil like jojoba or coconut). Add 10-12 drops per ounce of oil for adults. For children, pregnant women, or those with sensitive skin, add 5-6 drops.[14]\n\nTest the oil on a small area of your sunburn to make sure you don’t have an allergic reaction.\nRub the oil into the sunburn. You skin should feel a cold/hot sensation, and the itching should subside temporarily.[15]",
                "Apply witch hazel to the sunburn. Witch hazel contains tannis, which may reduce swelling, pain, and itching.[16] It is a good alternative if you don’t want to use hydrocortisone cream.\n\n\nRub a small amount of witch hazel cream into your sunburn (after patch testing for allergic reaction).\nUse a cotton ball to apply witch hazel water to your skin.\nUse witch hazel up to six times a day to relieve pain and itching.[17]",
                "Use .5%-1% hydrocortisone to relieve pain and itching. Hydrocortisone is an over the counter steroid cream that is often very successful at reducing inflammation, redness, and itching. It stops your cells from releasing inflammatory substances, which calms the skin.[18]\n\nApply hydrocortisone to your sunburn 4 times daily, rubbing it into your skin.[19]\n\nUse hydrocortisone very sparingly on your face and for no more than 4 or 5 days.[20]",
                "Take an over the counter antihistamine to stop itching. Sometimes the itchiness in a sunburn is caused by immune-system cells that release histamines to notify your brain that something is wrong.[21]An antihistamine can suppress this reaction and temporarily relieve itching and swelling.[22]\n\nTake a non-drowsy antihistamine (such as loratadine) during the day.[23] Follow the directions on the box for dosage and use.\nAt night you can take a diphenhydramine, which can cause extreme drowsiness. Don’t try to drive, operate machinery, or do anything that might endanger yourself or others when taking this antihistamine. Just go to sleep![24]\n\nIf the itching is severe, talk to your doctor about hydroxyzine. It is a prescription drug that sedates your central nervous system and also acts as an antihistamine.",
                "Use a topical anesthetic to numb your skin. Available as sprays, creams, and ointments, a local anesthetic blocks nerve signals in your body so you won’t feel the itching sensation.[25]\n\nTo use the aerosol spray, shake the can well and hold it 4-6 inches from your skin. Spray it on the sunburn and rub in gently. Be very careful not to spray any into your eyes.[26]\n\nFor creams, gels, or ointments, apply the cream to dry skin and gently rub until it is evenly distributed. Look for brands that include aloe which can help soothe your skin.[27]",
                "Take a hot shower for severe itching that doesn't respond to treatment. If you are experiencing what is known as the \"Hell Itch\"--extreme itching that usually sets in about 48 hours after a burn, a very hot shower may be the best course of action. The Hell Itch does not respond to other treatments, and is so persistent and severe it can lead to sleep deprivation, depression, aggressiveness, and suicidal thoughts.[28]\n\nIf no other treatment works, including those recommended by your doctor, you may choose to try this method. If you are under 18, talk to your parents first.\nTake a shower in water that is turned up as hot as you can stand.[29] Don't use soap or scrub your skin--the hot water will dry your skin out and soap will make this worse.\nContinue with the extremely hot showers until the itching subsides (usually about two days).[30]\n\nThe hot showers work because the brain can only process one sensation at a time. The heat of the water activates the pain nerves, which will suppress or shut down the sensation of itching.[31]",
                "Talk to your doctor about prescribing a high-potency steroid cream. If the itching is so bad you can't concentrate on anything else--you can't work, can't sleep--and feel like you might go crazy, your doctor may be able to help with an aggressive treatment. A high-potency steroid cream may reduce inflammation and calm the itching.[32]\n\nThese medications are available by prescription only, and can weaken your immune system and cause other serious side effects. They should only be used in the most extreme cases.[33]"

            "intro": "Divorce in New York can be accomplished quickly if the two spouses can agree on distribution of property, custody of children, and support and visitation. If you meet the residency requirements, New York has a step-by-step procedure for uncontested divorces including forms and detailed instructions.",
            "steps": [
                "Verify your eligibility to file for divorce in New York. The Domestic Relations laws for New York are very specific on residency. Section 230 states that to be eligible to file for divorce in New York, you must meet one of the requirements.[1]\n\nIf you were married in another state, either you or your spouse must have lived in New York for at least two continuous years before the filing date of your divorce.\nYou must have lived in New York for at least one continuous year if you were married in New York state or you and your spouse lived together in the state as a married couple.\nIf you will be alleging grounds other than \"irretrievable breakdown\" (no-fault divorce,) you and your spouse must be able to show one continuous year of residence and that the grounds occurred in New York state. For example, if you are alleging adultery, you must be able to show that the affair was consummated inside state lines.",
                "Choose your grounds for divorce. In an expedited divorce where the parties agree on all terms, the most common legal reason cited is section 170(7) of the Domestic Relations law, which states the relationship between the spouses has broken down hopelessly for a period of at least six months.[2]\n\nOther grounds include adultery, imprisonment, legal separation for over a year, cruelty, and abandonment.[3]\n\nUnless you and your spouse both agree to grounds, such as admitted adultery or imprisonment, strongly consider using the no-fault option. Divorce is stressful enough without placing blame in public documents. One exception is abandonment where you cannot locate your spouse. Alleging abandonment can help you get permission for service by publication.\nGrounds in New York are very specific. For example, cruelty must rise to the level of domestic violence to meet the standard. The acts of cruelty cannot have happened more than five years ago. You will be required to detail the acts with dates and places. If you want to allege specific grounds for your divorce, you should consult with a family law attorney to make sure you draft the petition with the level of detail required by the court.[4]",
                "Prepare to pay the filing fees. In an uncontested divorce, you can expect to pay approximately $350 in fees, not including a process server. You must be able to pay these fees at the time you file.\n\n\nIf you are low income, you may qualify to have some or all of the filing fees waived. You must file a notarized \"Affidavit in Support of Application to Proceed as a Poor Person.\"[5] The judge will review your application and may request that you provide proof of income and expenses. If your application is accepted, the judge will issue an order[6] and your divorce will proceed without payment of the filing fee.",
                "Review the requirements of the Uncontested Divorce Program. If there are no children under the age of 21 born or adopted into the marriage[7] and all property and debt division are unanimously agreed to, you can qualify for the expedited Uncontested Divorce Program.[8]\n\nOnly no-fault divorces, meaning the problems in the relationship have been ongoing for at least six months and cannot be reconciled, are eligible for this program. There can be no allegations of fault. At least one party must be willing to swear under oath to this breakdown of the marriage.[9]",
                "Verify your computer capabilities. To use this program, you must be at a computer equipped with Microsoft Word or the free Microsoft Word Viewer.[10] The computer must also be attached to a printer to generate your filing copies. There is no online filing option in New York.",
                "Gather the necessary information. The program has a checklist showing the information you will need before you start.[11] Most of it is straight forward, such as names and contact information for the parties, the date and place of the marriage, and details of the settlement agreement.\n\n\nA settlement agreement can be as simple as statements to the effect of, \"Parties have separated the personal property and debts.\" If there are vehicles or leases, list them individually. For example, \"Plaintiff will retain ownership of 2012 Toyota Camry, VIN #[number],\" or \"Defendant will retain the right to occupy the apartment located at [address].\"\nIf there is real estate, you must detail if it will be sold or if one of the parties will be keeping it. Detail out things like equity buy-outs or agreements on mortgage payments. For example, \"Plaintiff will retain ownership and assume the mortgage of house located at [address]. Defendant will receive a lump sum payment of [amount] payable by [date]. Upon payment, defendant will execute the necessary deeds in favor of plaintiff.\"\nEven though you are using the Uncontested Divorce Program, consider consulting with an attorney to create the settlement agreement if there are any complicated issues such as investments and retirement accounts. A little work before filing can speed the divorce through the system.",
                "Determine if the spouses will go back to former names. Regardless of who files as the plaintiff, if the wife or same-sex spouse adopted the other spouse's name in the marriage, the divorce petition can be used to legally restore the unmarried (\"maiden\") name. The same process can be used if both parties legally adopted hyphenated names. The divorce can restore the singular surname. This information can be entered in the form generator.",
                "Purchase an Index Number. Preparation of your documents will go faster if you already have your index number from the court. You can file a Summons and Notice and pay the fee to receive your index number.[12] At this time you will also file your application to have the fee waived. You will file at the courthouse in the county where you reside, even if another courthouse is closer.",
                "Use the state program to generate your divorce petition. The state of New York, working with Legal Services, has created an interactive online program to generate a court-ready document package for uncontested divorces.[13] One party can prepare the documents for the other to sign or you can work on it together.\n\n\nYou can also hire an attorney or document preparation service to prepare your divorce package. You will not be paying for representation, but for consultation and tailoring of the documents and services to meet your unique situation.[14]",
                "Review and sign the documents. Once you have your divorce package, both parties must read and sign the documents. The petition will need to be signed in front of a notary in blue ink to show that it is an original signature. You and your spouse can sign them separately, but both signatures must be on the same divorce package.",
                "File your divorce package. The state of New York provides a detailed step-by-step procedure to file your divorce documents.[15] In summary, you will bring your index number, your summons, and your completed divorce forms. Bring the original and two copies of all the documents. The court will keep the originals and return two file-stamped copies, one for each party, to you.",
                "Determine if service of process is needed. In your uncontested divorce, the easiest way to speed your divorce through the court is for the defendant to waive service by signing an Affidavit of Defendant.[16]\n\nIf your spouse refuses to sign the affidavit, you will have to hire a process server to deliver a copy of the summons and complaint. The process server will file an affidavit of service.[17] Expect to pay between $50 and $100 for this service.",
                "Put your divorce on the court calendar. If your spouse has signed the Affidavit of Defendant, you can request an immediate calendar entry. If not, you will have to wait a minimum of 40 days after the date of service to request a court date. Procedures vary a bit from county to county. Some courthouses are more formal than others. Speak with the court clerk as to whether you can schedule a hearing with an oral request or will need to ask in writing.",
                "Receive your final judgment. Depending on the county of filing, you may or may not have to appear in court. Ask the court clerk if there is a requirement for you to appear. Most courts, especially in the more populous counties may grant your divorce by signature. If this is the case, you will receive the postcard from your divorce package in the mail. At that time, you can pick the decree up at the court clerk's office. Bring your identification and expect to pay around $10. If you have an order waiving your fees, bring a copy and your document fees will also be waived.\n\n\nGive a copy to your spouse. You can now proceed with changing your name on documents, rewriting leases, or updating financial accounts.",
                "Verify that the divorce is uncontested. New York legal procedures when children are involved are quite complex. It is best for you and your spouse to agree on issues of property, custody, and visitation before you begin to prepare the mountain of forms.\n\n\nConsider summarizing your agreement in a memo that you and your spouse both sign and date. It may prevent arguments further into the procedure.",
                "Review the legal forms and instructions. There are 17 forms required to complete an uncontested divorce with children in New York. These forms can be downloaded as Microsoft Word documents or as .PDF files for printing. [18] The state has also compiled a detailed instruction book that details how to fill out the forms field by field.[19]\n\nAs you complete the forms, one or both spouses can elect to be restored to an unmarried surname. This includes couples that elected to legally hyphenate their names when they married. A divorce decree will allow reissue of driver's licenses, social security cards, and voter registration.\nNothing in the law prevents you from having help, either your spouse, someone else, or a paid preparer to complete the divorce package.\nType or print the forms neatly in black ink. This enables the forms to be copied and scanned clearly.",
                "Complete the child support worksheet. Even if you and your spouse are agreeing to a different amount, you must still file a completed worksheet to show what the payment would be under the law.[20] The judge will only deviate from the presumptive amount on a showing that there will be adequate support for the children. You must also complete a Medical Support Order stating that the parents will enroll the children in employer health care when it is available.[21]\n\nYou and your spouse can work on the worksheet together, you can exchange it with each of you filling out your part, or you can estimate your spouse's income and expenses. Note, if you estimate it, your spouse can contest the amount and delay the divorce. It is better to cooperate.",
                "Sign and notarize the documents. Most of the documents require your signature, some of them in front of a notary public. There are also places for your spouse to sign for an uncontested divorce. Even though you prepared the documents in black ink, sign them in blue to identify the original documents.",
                "Determine if service is needed before you file. Like a divorce with no children, the divorce with children can be expedited if the defendant is willing to waive service and accept the summons and complaint. To waive service, your spouse can sign the Defendant's Affidavit.[22]\n\nIf your spouse refuses to sign the affidavit, you will have to arrange for a process server to deliver the divorce package and file an Affidavit of Service.[23] This will add approximately 40 days to the length of the divorce procedure.",
                "File for an index number and calendar your divorce. Once the forms are complete and signed, you can file them at the courthouse in the county where you live, even if another courthouse is closer. At this time you will pay the filing fees or file an application to have the filing fees waived. Take the originals and two copies. The court will keep the originals and there will be one file-stamped copy for each of you.",
                "Receive your final divorce decree. Ask the court clerk if there is a requirement for you to appear. Depending on the county of filing, you may or may not have to be present in court for hearings on uncontested divorces. If divorce is granted by signature, you will receive the pre-filled postcard from your divorce package in the mail. At that time, you can pick up your divorce decree at the court clerk's office. Bring your identification and expect to pay around $10. If you have an order waiving your fees, bring a copy and your document fees will also be waived.\n\n\nGive a copy to your spouse. You can now proceed with changing your name on documents, rewriting leases, updating school records, and financial accounts."

        "wikiHow to Be Diligent": {
            "intro": "Being diligent is an essential skill in all aspects of life. It involves being able to focus and concentrate persistently to achieve the completion of the task at hand. By maintaining focus and self-discipline and by practicing self-care, you can be diligent in your work and accomplish your goals, whether personal, professional or academic.",
            "steps": [
                "Keep a planner. A planner helps you organize your day and maintain diligence. You’ll need to write down all major exams and due dates for a given semester or term. You should include allotted times for studying and stick to them. You’ll be glad you’ve studied all semester so you won’t have to cram for exams.[1]",
                "Don’t overextend yourself with courses and extra-curricular activities. While everyone who wants to get the most out of college will want to take their money’s worth of courses and participate in some extra-curricular activities, make sure you haven’t overloaded yourself with obligations. If you’re signing up for far more than the minimum of credits (or even taking the maximum), and participating in more clubs than you can keep track of, you may need to take stock and slim down your schedule so you can be diligent in all your pursuits.[2]\n\nYou’ll want to watch drop/add periods to make sure you can drop a class if needed.",
                "Get an early start on projects. Waiting until the end of the semester to work on a big project will only make you more stressed than you have to be, especially when you’re also studying for exams. Instead, talk to your professor early to get an idea of what the project entails, and what steps you can do when. Getting an early start will take a load off when you’re swamped with studying for exams.[3]\n\nIt’s not a good idea to start a project before you’ve gotten the assignment sheet or talked to the professor. You may waste a lot of time doing something other than what the assignment is really about.",
                "Allow for the unexpected. Sometimes life intervenes and makes it difficult or impossible to reach a goal when you want to, or to finish a project on time. You may have to re-schedule, re-work, and re-evaluate your goals. This is all okay and a normal part of progress. There is no need to be hard on yourself when this happens.[4]\n\nHowever, don't confuse real reasons (like a sudden severe illness in the family or the loss of a job) with excuses (your friend called and wants to hang out when you have a deadline).\nMake sure you are communicating with professors and teachers when this happens. You may even want to contact your academic advisor or guidance counselor.",
                "Remove distractions. Too much time on the internet, your phone or in front of the television can distract you from your goals. It is easy to get off task if your phone is going off or you have social media tabs open on your computer while you're working.[5][6]\n\nThere are even apps that help you remove distractions for certain periods of time.\nYou can turn off your notifications on your phone or turn on the \"do not disturb\" mode.",
                "Keep yourself organized with to-do lists. You can make separate lists for urgent, high-priority, and low-priority tasks. Or you can make lists by date. For instance you can list all of the tasks that need to be done today in one list, and all the things that need to be tomorrow on another list. By knowing what you want to accomplish, you can get a lot more done. Breaking larger tasks into smaller steps can help you see the overall time a task will take and its potential complexity. You can schedule time for each task or subtask. Keeping the list to three items can help you focus and get things done.[7]",
                "Prioritize. Pushing back other things of less importance can help you focus on the task that will help you reach your goals. Deadlines can help you determine what's important, as well as the impact of completing or not completing a task will have on you and your employer.[8]\n\nFor instance, you can wait to answer an non-urgent email to a friend you see regularly when you're working on a work-project.\nIf you’re uncertain what to prioritize, ask your manager or boss.",
                "Use time efficiently. Making a schedule and having a plan for the day will help you see how you are using your time. This is where you can set deadlines, make appointments, and schedule breaks. Remember to give yourself enough time for each task. [9]",
                "Focus your energy on your goal. Sticking to the plan can help you put your energy into achieving your goals. Remind yourself of your goals and why you're focusing on the task at hand. Sometimes devotion will seem easy, and other times you'll have to push yourself to maintain it.[10]\n\nMaking and repeating a mantra like “I can lose weight” or “I can get the kitchen remodeled by Thanksgiving” can help you keep your goals in mind when you’re tempted to let them slide.[11]",
                "Reward yourself to spur motivation. The kind of reward will depend on the milestone you've reached and the type of goal your pursuing. If you're intent on losing weight, don't reward yourself with an extra-large pizza when you lose a pound. You don't want to reward every little thing, because the rewards will lose their meaning. Rather, focus on rewarding real progress by setting up subgoals and rewarding yourself once you've met those goals.[12]",
                "Realize the value of hard work. When you accomplish one goal, before you move on to the next one, make sure you take the time to appreciate your accomplishments. Each step usually builds upon the previous. With time, you'll see how your hard work has paid off.[13]",
                "Find an accountability partner or group. This should be a person who knows you well enough to know what might get in your way. They will be helpful in motivating you to make progress on your goals. Sometimes, all you need is someone who is working on the same goals as you. For instance if you’re trying to lose weight, you might try a weight-loss group.[14][15]",
                "Be realistic. You may need to re-prioritize at times. You may realize after a few weeks or months of pursuing a goal that you need more time, sometimes a lot more time. Don't be too hard on yourself when this happens. Be careful not to lose heart when you've reached an obstacle to your goal.[16]",
                "Realize when to give up. This is not a step to be taken lightly. Some goals like losing weight or getting a raise are totally reachable for most people. Other goals, on the other hand, like winning a gold medal, becoming President of the United States, or owning a multi-national corporation may be attainable by only a few people. This is not to say you shouldn't try, but that recognizing when to let a goal go and start something new can be empowering when a goal is no longer attainable.[17]\n\nAsking yourself whether your drive to pursue a certain goal is negatively impacting your relationships with people you love can help you determine whether to give up on a goal."

        "wikiHow to Fix a Bad Rental History": {
            "intro": "A bad rental history can have a negative impact on your ability to rent an apartment or even to get a first-time home loan. If your bad rental history is haunting you, you can take action to erase the negative history and start building a more positive future.",
            "steps": [
                "Purchase a rental history report for yourself. Some credit reporting agencies, such as Experian, also have divisions that produce reports on your rental history.[1] By learning exactly what is on your rental history, you can see the information that property managers see and start taking steps to fix it.\n\n\nYou can purchase a copy of your own rental report from a reporting company such as Experian, or you can purchase one from a third-party company.[2]",
                "Examine the report for incorrect information. Accidents can happen, and the report might reflect incorrect data related to your rental history. Your rental history falls under the umbrella of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). According to this law, reporting agencies must correct or remove any information that is incomplete, incorrect, or unverifiable.[3] If any information on your report falls into this category, contact the reporting agency. They must usually remove or correct the information from your report within thirty days.[4]\n\nThis also applies to credit reports in case you’re having trouble renting due to incorrect information bringing down your credit score.[5]\n\nIf the reporting agency claims to verify the information as correct, they do not need to remove it.[6] Build a case if possible. Contact the owner, property manager, or landlord who oversaw your lease, and see if he or she will attest to the falsity of the information as it appears on the rental history report.",
                "Try to fix negative aspects of the report that are true. Just because a negative portion of your rental history might be true, you still aren’t necessarily stuck with it. If, for example, you never paid a late fee on your last month of rent in a previous location, this information can end up on your rental history, but you can still contact the landlord or the community and try to fix it. Check with the landlord to see if you can still pay the fee (or whatever the source of the negative reporting). Get your payment in writing and submit it to the reporting company to have the instance of outstanding debt removed from your rental record.\n\n\nThis can also work when trying to fix your more general credit report.\nIf the landlord for the home or apartment you wish to rent wishes to contact your previous landlords rather than rely on a rental history reporting agency, this step is even more important. contact the previous landlord, apologize for the negative renting behavior, and offer to pay any money owed. The landlord may agree to update the reference he or she will give you for amending how you previously left things.",
                "Petition to have old evictions removed. You can petition to have a previous eviction removed from your rental history by the reporting company if you’ve since repaid the landlord or community.[7] Look into an eviction expungement in your county. By proving that you’ve since paid the debt or that the eviction was unfairly brought against you, you stand a good chance of having the request granted.[8] The reporting company will then be required to remove the information via the FCRA.",
                "Have outdated information removed. Also under the FCRA, reporting agencies must remove bankruptcies ten or more years old, as well as most other negative reporting that is seven or more years old.[9] If old information has brought down your rental history, then you can request to have it removed under the FCRA.",
                "Convince beneficial previous landlords to report for the programs. Only landlords and communities that participate in the rental reporting programs will appear on your rental history. This means that if the application for a future community uses a reported rental history instead of requesting references from previous landlords, they can end up with an incomplete picture.[10] Contact previous landlords who will report positive rental history information about you, and encourage them to submit that information to a rental history reporting program.\n\n\nThis step might not help remove bad information, but balancing it with positive information provides a better, more accurate representation. This can especially work in your favor if the beneficial information will be more recent and frequent than the negative aspects of the report.",
                "Include a cover letter with your application. You may not always be able to repair your entire rental history. However, you can take other steps to address the history with your prospective landlord. If your application for the home or apartment includes an authorization for the landlord to perform a credit or rental history check, then you already know what he or she is likely to encounter. By including a cover letter, you can take responsibility for any blemishes on your records, explain the surrounding circumstances, and assure the landlord that you’ll always pay rent on time for the duration of your lease.[11]\n\nDo not blame others or wallow in self-pity in the cover letter. Keep the letter concise and factual, and point to concrete examples of where you’ve otherwise been a responsible renter.[12]",
                "Include references. Explaining the reasons behind your poor rental history can help, but showing the prospective landlord that other people trust you will go even further. Try to get letters of recommendation from your boss, a previous roommate, another recent landlord, etc.[13]\n\nSubmitting the letters of recommendation along with your cover letter on the application can also make an immediate first impression with the landlord regarding how organized you are and how serious you are about the rental.",
                "Find a co-signer. Many landlords are willing to overlook a poor rental history if you can find a close friend or relative with good credit to co-sign the lease with you.[14] A co-signer doesn’t actually live with you like a roommate but simply agrees to be held responsible as well if you damage the property or fail to pay your rent.\n\n\nEssentially a co-signer agrees to take over payments if you fail to make them or risks affecting his or her own credit.[15]\n\nDon’t ever take advantage of someone who agrees to co-sign a lease for you.\nThis is also a good option for a first-time renter whose problem is a lack of a rental history as opposed to a bad one.",
                "Offer to pay in advance or a larger security deposit. At the end of the day, a landlord simply wants to receive your rent on time. Offering to pay two or three months of rent in advance (or allowing the landlord to retain a larger security deposit) can help reassure the landlord that you’re serious about the renting responsibility.[16]",
                "Offer to pay more in rent. Most people may not have two or three months of rent to pay in advance. However, you can similarly offer to pay a little more on your monthly rent.[17] Even offering to pay an additional $25 each month equates to an extra $300 for the landlord over a twelve-month lease.",
                "Provide proof of employment. Showing the landlord proof of employment and pay stubs to verify your income might help convince him or her that you will be a reliable renter.[18] The aforementioned letter of recommendation from your manager or supervisor is beneficial here as well. Have him or her verify the length of your employment and your job responsibilities. Proving recent dependability in other aspects of your life can work in your favor.",

If your problem has always been remembering to pay your rent more so than the availability of the funds, you can suggest a direct payment method with your prospective landlord.

        "How to Lead a Discussion": {
            "intro": "Classroom discussion is a time-honored way to learn. It is also an evidence-based way to help students retain information,[1] pay attention,[2] and gain real insight. However, if you’re a discussion leader, you may be nervous. Preparing for, opening, and continuing a great discussion is a skill you can learn. These steps advise you on every aspect of leading a good discussion, from keeping everyone engaged, to managing strong personalities, to wrapping up the discussion. So if you find yourself needing to lead a class in college or high school, or if you are simply interested in alternative ways of learning, practice these skills and make them your own. Soon you will be on your way to leading engaging and thought-provoking discussions where everyone learns -- including yourself!",
            "steps": [
                "Ask a question that inspires a productive conversation. The best questions are neither too open-ended nor too limited. \"Yes or No\" questions halt discussion, while overly broad questions (such as \"What do you think about Romeo and Juliet?\") questions also tend to discourage discussion. The best questions are balanced; they are open enough that there seem to be a few good answers, yet closed enough that people know how to approach them, and feel motivated to start talking.\n\n\nFor example, suppose you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet. You may start by asking, \"In what ways does the Friar make mistakes in guiding Romeo? In what ways does he succeed?\" This question doesn't feed any answers, but leads students in a productive direction.",
                "Be prepared. As the discussion leader, you should come into the meeting with several \"big\" questions. Be prepared to ask the next one when discussion dies down, when people need more food for thought. The more prepared you feel when you walk into a classroom, the more confident you’ll look. If you look confident in your ideas and your approach, students will be more likely to respect you and to cooperate.\n\n\nIt can be helpful to give participants 1-2 questions in advance to give them more time to provide thoughtful contributions when the discussion comes.\nAlso, it can be helpful to give participants the questions you'll discuss in class, on paper, or on the board. Some students learn better and think more effectively if they have the questions out in front of them. This can also be an excellent reminder of the main question for the day.\nIn a 2 hour discussion, 2-5 good questions should suffice. It is also good to have 2 or 3 smaller sub-questions for each main question. However, you should prepare for at least 1.5 times as much material as you think you’ll cover, just in case students are particularly reticent that day or in case one line of inquiry wasn’t as fruitful as you thought it was.",
                "Provide clear guidelines for participation. Everyone knows how to have a conversation; but a thoughtful discussion is more intentional and more focused than just a chat. If you want to start the conversation off on the right foot, then let the students know exactly what your expectations are. Should students raise their hand before speaking? Or should they speak freely without raising their hands? Should they use \"Mr.\" and \"Ms.\" when addressing their fellow students? These details clarify expectations and hence increase student confidence. You might also coach students on how to avoid personal biases in their responses, or any terms to use or avoid, and what to do if the discussion gets heated.[3]\n\nIf you have a handout with “Dos” and “Don’ts” listed on it, this can help students stay on track, too.",
                "Provide a shared frame of reference, such as a book, video, or other media. It’s important for you and the students to have something you can all talk about before you begin the discussion. This can be almost anything: the assigned reading for that day’s class, a news story or poem, a work of art, or even a natural object like a sunset. The important thing is that you and the students share a common object of study so the discussion can be concrete instead of wallowing in abstractions.[4]\n\nMake the expectations for being prepared clear. If you don’t have incentive for students to do the homework or consequences for students who are unprepared, then they’ll be less likely to come to class with fresh, exciting ideas.",
                "Maintain enthusiasm for the topic. One way to make sure that the discussion goes well is to show your enthusiasm for the subject right from the beginning. If you have engaged body language, are alert and energetic, and show how the topic is important to your life and the lives of the students, they’ll be much more likely to be engaged. If they think that you’re tired, apathetic, or just trying to get the discussion over with, then they’ll be less likely to care.[5]\n\nEven if a topic isn’t inherently fascinating, don’t try to cushion the blow by saying, “I know this isn’t that exciting, guys…” Instead, show that the topic is worth caring about; your students will follow.\nSometimes, showing that something has real-world applications can help your students care about it. If you’re studying a historical event, for example, then starting off the class with a news article about an event with similar themes or values behind it — such as current protests against discrimination in relation to race riots of the 1960s — can help students stay engaged.",
                "Define key terms. One helpful way to begin the discussion is to define any key terms that may be useful to your students throughout the discussion. For example, if you’re giving a lesson on poetry, you can discuss simile, metaphor, allusion, or any other literary devices that are central to the poem. If all of your students feel like they’re on the same page and have a strong foundation before they begin the discussion, then they’ll be much more confident about participating.\n\n\nEven if it feels like you’re oversimplifying things a bit, it’s better to have everyone on the same page before the discussion really kicks off than to lose a few students. Some students may be too shy to admit they’re confused about some of the more simple terms, and it’s important to explain them before you can move forward.",
                "Present yourself well. In order to lead a meaningful discussion, you should strike a balance between confidence about what you know and a willingness to learn more. A discussion is an adventure -- you may not know exactly where it will go, but you can lead the way. If you are willing to be vulnerable in showing that you don't know everything, students will be more likely to be vulnerable too.\n\n\nPresent yourself as a professional in dress and body language: stand tall, make eye contact, and smile. [6]\n\nBe genuinely excited about your students’ ideas to help generate enthusiasm for the topic. Point out great comments and ask the student to repeat it. They may not even realize that they made a great comment!",
                "Maintain an atmosphere of safety and respect. One of your most important jobs is creating an atmosphere of respect, even respectful disagreement. If you want to encourage your students to participate, then you have to give them a safe environment for doing so. You have to make it clear that all of the students deserve respect and that no one will be made to feel unworthy because of their ideas or opinions. You should treat students positively and reward them for contributing.[7]\n\nAnd never make them feel stupid, and don't let other students do so. If a student is being rude to another student, address the problem head-on instead of letting the conversation go on; if you say nothing, you’ll make it look like it’s acceptable for students to be rude to each other.\nEncourage students for speaking instead of tearing them down. Make them feel excited to join the discussion, instead of self-conscious.",
                "Make arguments. Don't just share your feelings or opinions without backing them up. If you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet and someone asserts, \"The Friar shouldn't have given Romeo any advice!\" ask them why that is so. Discuss possible support or objections to their claim. Use the \"Pros and Cons\" model; argue for a position, and then let students argue against it (or argue against it yourself!). Ask: which conclusion would hold up better in a court of law? This can lead to meaningful results without having the students feel like you’re spoon-feeding them the answers.\n\n\nHelp guide students to reach conclusions for themselves. If the objective of the discussion is only to make the students see the “right” answer, then you might as well have lectured at them instead.",
                "Move from the known to the unknown. No one can learn if they know everything already; and no one can learn if they know nothing. A good discussion begins when we realize we know something but need to learn more. Even if you feel you have answered a question, press deeper. Find another puzzle you don't yet understand, or move to the next area of interest. Once you’ve established something you and the group have puzzled out, move on to a new, more complicated mystery. Use your previous discussion as a reference point and continue to dig deeper.\n\n\nTreat each new “unknown” as an exciting mystery that the students will solve together. Even if you’ve already thought it through, act like you’re figuring it out right along with them.",
                "Manage personalities. Some students love to discuss and debate; others feel anxious speaking in a group. Give space to each different person, and don't worry if you sometimes make mistakes. Make sure every participant has an opportunity to be heard. Some will not take the opportunity, but they will feel cared for that it was presented. Work to make sure that every student is heard, and that some students aren’t heard too much. Make it so students with conflicting personalities don’t have misunderstandings and that everyone gets along, for the most part.\n\n\nFor the more talkative student, here are a few tips: 1. Ask them to speak only 5 times that day and make them keep track of their comments; this allows them to decide which comments are really important. 2. Ask them to help lead the discussion; let them ask questions and not just answer your questions every time. 3. Invite them to write out their thoughts and present a conclusion at the end of class. 4. Tell them that they get a turn to speak every time a quieter person speaks first; this will encourage them to balance each other out.\nFor the quieter student, here are a few tips: 1. Try specifically ask the quieter members what they think of the topic. 2. Invite them to write their thoughts out and offer to read their thoughts to the class at the beginning of the next discussion. 3. Allow room for silence and reflection while \"internal processors\" think through the discussion.\nBe aware of the different personality types in your classroom and of how they succeed the most in group discussions. For example, if you have a student who likes to absorb the conversation and then weigh in toward the end, let this student take the time he needs instead of forcing him to speak when he’s not ready.\nDon't take it personally if some students refuse to participate. They may have other things going on in their life, such as social anxiety or family stress, that make it difficult for them to engage. Encourage them, if possible, that their presence matters.",
                "Write ideas down. One technique to help maintain a productive class discussion is to write down the ideas of your students throughout the discussion. This can remind students of what you’re talking about and can give them something to point back to. You can even write their ideas down in a slightly more articulate way to help frame the discussion. If you do this, though, make sure you write down most of the ideas that are said so some students don’t feel discouraged if you don’t write down their ideas.\n\n\nYou can even consider having one student as a designated “note taker” who stands at the board and writes down the ideas as they come.",
                "Remember that it’s about the topic, not you. When you lead a class discussion, you may be feeling self-conscious and thinking that if it’s not going well, that it’s because the students don’t like you or respect you. This negative thinking will only discourage you instead of focusing on the topic at hand. If your students aren’t responding well or aren’t as engaged as they could be, then remind yourself that this is because the topic could be presented in a new light, not because there’s something wrong with you.[8]\n\nOnce you stop focusing on there being something wrong with you, you’ll have more freedom to turn to the discussion topic and to make the conversation as dynamic as possible.",
                "Manage your time well. One important aspect of leading a discussion is making sure that you hit most of the important points you wanted to hit. If students get too stuck on one point that isn’t central to the discussion, then you can move the conversation along to the more important aspects of the day’s material. That said, if you find that students are having a fascinating conversation about something you didn’t intend to hit and that they are really learning from each other, then you can continue to use this time to explore a new line of thinking.\n\n\nTime management is an important part of leading a class discussion. It’s important to keep the students on track and avoid talking about one minor quibble for the entirety of your class time.\nFind a way to subtly check the clock or your watch from time to time. You don’t want to make the students nervous when you do this.\nGive students a \"two minute warning\" to allow them to slow down, reflect, and present any closing thoughts or last words.",
                "Help students address each other. One way to help move the discussion forward is to help students talk to each other instead of to you. As long as the conversation is respectful and well-meaning, then having them directly address each other’s points can help them get to know each other and can facilitate a meaningful discussion without any barriers. If you find that this technique is making the conversation too aggressive or argumentative, then you can pull students back a bit.\n\n\nHaving the students talk to each other more can lead to a more dynamic, exciting discussion. They’ll feel like they can talk more openly if they’re talking to each other instead of just addressing the teacher.\nJust make sure to stress that they should do this in a respectful manner and that focuses on the person’s ideas, not the person.",
                "Manage problem students. Unfortunately, just one problem student can ruin an entire discussion. If there’s a person in your class who always talks out of turn, interrupts others constantly, puts down the views of others, or just generally disrespects you and the other students, then you need to work on addressing the problem head-on as quickly as you can so this one student doesn’t keep the others from learning. You can first try to address the problem in class, and if that doesn’t work, you can pull the student aside and talk about his or her behavior privately.\n\n\nThere are many kinds of problem students. For example, if one of your students talks out of turn, stress the importance of raising his hand before he speaks.\nIf you have a student who talks too much, tell him to wait until at least four other people have spoken before contributing again. Though this may sound harsh, it can help this student focus on listening to what others have to say.\nOccasionally, though thankfully not very often, an overbearing participant may need to be removed from the discussion. Mostly, such students respond well to gentle but firm correction. It does happen, though, that a student refuses to play by the rules. It is not fair to the participants who want to learn to allow one person to ruin the discussion. If possible, and after many warnings, you may want to find a way to organize the discussion without them.\nIf you have students who are distracted or doing other things during your class, sit them up front and pay extra attention to them.\nIf you’re having trouble leading a discussion because many students aren’t doing the reading, then you should incentivize them to do their homework by giving reading check quizzes at the beginning of class, making class participation a higher percentage of the course grade, or finding other ways to hold them more accountable for doing their work.",
                "Summarize as you go. One way to make sure that all of the students are on the same page is to summarize the class discussion as you move forward. You can make it feel seamless, and not like an interruption of the conversation. Even repeating the points that you or your students have made with extra care can help your students get a firmer painting of the big picture. Make a point of slowing down and rebooting every 20 minutes or so, especially if you’re teaching a longer class, so that everyone is on track.\n\n\nYou can ask other students to help you with this task. Say something like, “Okay, what have we learned so far?” and have volunteers help you out.",
                "Tie it all together. When the allotted time for the discussion is up, or when things have reached a natural end point, do a full summary of what you covered. Talk about the point you started from, and remind the students of any arguments that were made along the way. Don’t invalidate any arguments and focus on bringing together all of the different ideas you talked about instead of acting like you’re showing students the one and only way something should be done. Make sure you leave some time to do this so your students aren’t distracted and ready to pack up their bags.\n\n\nThis is where leaving notes on the board during the discussion can really come in handy. Having something you can point to can make it easier to wrap up your ideas.\nYou can even try having another student or two wrap up the class discussion. This can make students feel more accountable and involved.",
                "Leave room for questions. Make sure to leave at least a few minutes for questions at the end of class. You want students to leave the discussion feeling like they learned something, not like they are utterly confused. If you wait until the class is almost over to ask if anyone has questions, then students will be much more reluctant to say anything because they won’t want to hold up or even prolong the class. Leave a suitable amount of time for questions and make sure to encourage students to speak up if they’re confused.\n\n\nAnswering the students’ questions can also help you wrap up the discussion more thoroughly.\nHaving people ask questions can also give you insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your discussion. If five students seem to be confused about the same thing, then it may be because you didn’t cover it thoroughly enough in your discussion.",
                "Leave 'em hungry. Close with a related question, or a \"suggestion for further research.\" This will give all involved something to think about for next time. You shouldn’t leave students feeling like you discussed absolutely everything there was to say about the given topic and that you had completely solved the puzzle together. Instead, you should have moved the conversation forward, helped students gain valuable insight, and leave them looking forward to the next discussion.\n\n\nLeaving your students wanting more can also give you a logical place to pick up during the next class. They’ll come to class feeling ready and excited to continue the conversation, and they may have even gained some insight into the topic in the meantime.\nConsider conducting a brief “check out”. Let students talk about where the discussion leaves them or where they will go next. They can do this at the end of class, or even in a written survey they take during the last few minutes of class.",
                "Notice who did or did not participate to improve next time. After the discussion is over, ask yourself who did the most talking, who did the least talking, and who contributed the most meaningfully to the conversation. Keep in mind that talking the most doesn’t actually mean contributing the most, either. The next time you lead a discussion, you can work on encouraging the more quiet students a bit more, and making sure that everyone has a chance to speak and that the students don’t feel dominated by a few more confident speakers.[9]\n\nRemind yourself that no discussion is perfect. As you improve at leading class discussions, you’ll improve at making sure that all students participate in the conversation."

                "Volunteer your storytelling ability whenever you can. Often, the beginning of a professional storytelling career involves many free performances at public events. By volunteering at a local library, community day care, cafe, charity, or other venue, an amateur storyteller can gain the experience needed to perfect their craft and transition into becoming a professional storyteller.[1] As the old saying goes, “Practice makes perfect.”",
                "Start a storytelling club or event. If you don’t have many events or storytelling venues near you, take the initiative and found your own. Propose the idea to start a public storytelling hour to your local library or coffee shop. Give your story event a theme. For instance, you might open the event up for proposals pertaining to specific themes like romance, adventures on the sea, or troubles with technology.[2]\n\nDon’t make your theme too specific. For instance, a theme like “my first date” might get a lot of similar stories and be boring for the audience.\nSet a time limit so you don’t get stories that are too long and rambling. Ten minutes is usually a good limit for the average story.\nAlternately, you could just get your closest friends together in your living room on a Friday or Saturday night and swap stories in a semi-structured way. You could select a specific theme, or you could just provide an open forum for sharing stories.\nStoryCorps is a podcast which attempts “to preserve and share humanity’s stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world.”[3] For the hefty sum of $3,500 per day, you can host a StoryCorps event in your community. (You might consider soliciting public funding or private fundraising to help with the fee.) Interviews can last forty minutes and are added to the Library of Congress archives. They are also available online.[4]",
                "Start your own podcast. A podcast is a streaming or downloadable audio interview. Podcasts are a great format for telling your own story or those of others. With some editing, you can incorporate music into your podcast too. Your podcast can be narrow (stories in the history of astronomy) or broad (stories from around the world) in focus.\n\n\nPodcasts can be hard to produce. Get help from a trained sound engineer to record and produce your podcast.\nAs you build your audience, seek local businesses for financial support. Offer them advertising space on your podcast.[5]\n\nWhile you can easily do a simple podcast on your home computer with your built-in microphone and recording software, a good podcast will need to invest in high-quality technology.[6] If conducting interviews over Skype, Pamela is a great program for PC users. A similar program, Ecamm Call Recorder, is available for Mac users. Adobe Audition is a useful program for editing purposes.",
                "Attend storytelling clubs and festivals. Storyteller groups host festivals all over the country. Whether you attend festivals or conferences as a participant or as a member of the audience, take advantage of the opportunity to hear other storytellers to hone your own craft and inspire you to find new stories of your own. Conferences are great opportunities to perform or engage in professional development.\n\n\nThe largest festival -- the National Storytelling Festival -- takes place each year in Tennessee.[7]\n\nCheck the National Storytelling Network’s calendar at http://www.storynet.org/events/calendar.php to search for storytelling events in your area.",
                "Read a lot. Read both fiction and nonfiction in a conscious way, thinking about what made a given story memorable. Memoirs are especially useful for helping you think about how to frame your personal experience and regurgitate it as a great story. Read storytelling guides to improve your delivery, learn how to pace your story, and understand what makes a story great.[8]\n\nWhile you might intuitively understand some or all of these storytelling elements already, explicitly recognizing how these elements work in conversation with each other will hone your storytelling skills\nYou probably have lots of questions and issues about becoming a professional storyteller that someone else has already dealt with. Learn from their experiences, avoid their pitfalls, and adopt their paths to success.",
                "Solicit feedback.[9] Don’t get feedback from any random audience member. Get feedback from people who are professional orators, actors, writers, and storytellers. Ask them what worked and what didn’t. Make improvements if their criticisms are well-founded and continuously review your own storytelling style and material to become the best storyteller you can be.\n\n\nBeyond some simple feedback and nurturing, consider getting real coaching from another storyteller. A storyteller coach will tailor their advice to your specific needs and presentation and give concrete steps to help you build your business.[10]",
                "Work on your timing. Pause for laughter when something is funny. If you say something that is meant to be funny but falls flat, move on.[11] Use pauses between sentences to give your story a natural, conversational rhythm. Do not speak too fast or you will lose the audience. Remember, storytelling is not a race. Pause before revealing a surprise or a shocking conclusion.\n\n[12]\nIf you plan on telling a story and you know you’re limited to a certain amount of time, ensure your story is the right length. Do not try to jam a 15 minute story into 8 minutes.\nUse repetition of a certain action or event to set up a pattern that will later be broken, or drive home feelings of drudgery or disappointment. For instance, if your story is about a person’s boring life, don’t just say that they walk home “alone, every single day.” Say instead that “They walked home. Alone. Every. Single. Day.” This emphasizes the monotonous, lonely nature of their life.\nSpeak rapidly -- but not so fast that the audience can’t understand you -- to describe or depict a sudden, jarring event or action.\nWork on your timing not only within each story, but between stories as well. If you intend to deliver multiple stories to a class or group of people, follow a longer story with a shorter one, and vice versa. This will give your listeners a chance to mentally rest and reset their attention.",
                "Be confident in your delivery. Enunciate clearly and project your voice so that everyone in attendance can hear you. Your delivery should be energetic and memorable.[13] Do not use filler words like “uh,” “anyways,” “you know,” and so on. Keep your head up and eyes forward. It helps to focus your eyes not on any particular member of the audience, but on a point just over the heads of the audience and towards the back of the venue in which you’re telling your story.\n\n\nBe authentic when telling your story. Even if the story you tell is fictional, show enthusiasm for the characters and events.\nDon’t be afraid to use unique voices for certain characters.[14] For instance, if your story features a fierce monster, make your voice harsh and scary when reciting the monster’s dialogue. If your character(s) are afraid, speak in (audible) whispers, as they would. Getting into character can bring the story to life.",
                "Keep your story focused.[15] A good story will revolve around a single well-defined idea, topic, or theme.[16] When developing and practicing your story, ask yourself, “What is this story about?” If you cannot answer concisely in a sentence or two, revise the content of your story to keep it more tightly focused.\n\n\nYour audience should also be able to summarize the main theme or events of the story in a succinct way. If other people who read or hear your story get confused in the telling, you may need to edit the story.\nFor instance, if you rehearse your story in front of a test audience of friends or family and they all have competing and contradictory ideas about what the story is about, you might want to revise the way you tell your story.\nExamine each part of your story and ask yourself if it adds to the narrative flow. The events of your story should be clear and connect with one another in a logical way.\nListen to the advice of others when developing your story. It is important to understand how other people receive and understand your story if it is to be effective and memorable. Soliciting feedback from other writers is especially useful.",
                "Use body language to engage your audience. Sharing a story well requires a total physical and mental commitment on the part of the storyteller.[17] The amount of physicality you include in your storytelling varies with the content and style of the story. Incorporating physical movement into your storytelling enhances the experience.\n\n\nFor instance, if you’re telling a story about a big bird, you might say, “Then the bird swooped down from its nest.” While saying this, you might raise your hand high above your head and bend it at the wrist in a ninety degree angle. You could then move the hand across and down your body at a forty-five degree angle and elongate the long “O” sound in “swooped.” This would add an exciting physical dimension to the story and help the audience visualize what it was like to see the bird swooping down from its perch.\nDon’t over-perform your story. A storyteller is not an actor.[18] Always keep your body language appropriate and relevant to the tone and style of the story.",
                "Don’t quit your day job too soon.[19] Working as a storyteller can be difficult: work might be rare or periodical at times and unless you are highly sought-after, it might be hard to support yourself with your storytelling income. Work part-time as a storyteller and keep your full-time job until you’re well-established. Set some benchmarks to help you decide when you should make the move from part-time to full-time storytelling.\n\n\nFor example, you might decide that if you make $1,500 each month from your storytelling, you can become a full-time storyteller.\nA supportive spouse or partner who contributes to the household income can make it easier for you to take the necessary risk which becoming a full-time storyteller entails.\nKeep enough money in the bank to carry you through lean times. Maintain at least six months’ worth of funds.",
                "Build a web presence. Start by building a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and the like. As you get more experience and start to develop your business, contract a web designer for your own web domain. Having your own website is important because it gives you total control over the style and presentation of your own work in a way that social media sites do not.\n\n\nUpload audio and/or video of your stories in part or in whole\nProvide a bio of yourself, including how you got started as a storyteller and what drew you to it. Make your own life a story!\nBe sure to include contact info for people who want you to deliver some stories to their event or party.\nGet listed in online directories.[20] The Storyteller.net directory is a good place to start.[21] List your available services on local marketing sites like Craigslist to get your name out, too.",
                "File the necessary paperwork. Open a business account, register your business with your local and state authorities, and maintain accurate tax and financial information. Like any other home business, professional storytelling requires a keen eye for finances. Take some accounting classes or enlist the services of a skilled accountant to ensure your home-based business conforms to the letter of the law. Your business will probably be registered as a sole proprietorship, a business which is owned and operated by a single person.",
                "Be professional. Being professional means comporting yourself with grace and dignity, and demanding respect from your audience and hosts. For a professional storytelling session, always plan ahead. Find out where the venue you’ll be performing is, where you can park, and how many people will be in attendance. If possible, scout out the location before attending. Ask important questions like if you will be provided a microphone, bottled water, or other amenities.[22]\n\nIf you are performing in a large hall in which sound does not easily carry, suggest -- or insist -- that your hosts provide a microphone for your performance. Remember, your reputation will suffer whether a bad storytelling performance is or isn’t your fault.\nSimilarly, don’t be afraid to ask that a teacher, parent, or other adult stay in the library or classroom with you if you’re delivering a story to children.\nAlways aim to defy your clients' expectations and leave them wanting more.[23]",
                "Join a professional organization. The National Storytelling Network is the country’s largest storytelling organization. There are many other local and national storytelling organizations, some with specialties like African or Native American heritage stories, others with stories about history, nature, or another topic of special interest.[24]\n\nDepending on the club or organization your join, you will gain access to any number of neat perks. Becoming a member of the National Storytelling Network, for instance, will allow you to apply for NSN grants, access online discussion groups, and attend the National Storytelling Conference.[25]\n\nCheck http://www.storynet.org/resources/organizations.html for a list of organizations by state.",
                "Find your audience. Many professional storytellers get more successful in their business when they identify a particular audience for their tales. Ask yourself what kind of stories you like to tell and who they would most appeal to. For instance, if you love metaphorical fables about anthropomorphic animals, or tall tales about fantastic happenings, you might be best suited to storytelling for a youth audience.",
                "Consider a career as a children's entertainer. Many professional storytellers reach out to the primary consumers of stories: Many professionals will admit that opportunities for children's entertainment far outnumber gigs for storytelling to adults. Being open to a young audience will help storytellers build a career.\n\n\nLibrarians often pull double duty as both librarian and storyteller.[26] If you have a passion for telling stories, you might be able to introduce a storytelling program to your library.",
                "Think about doing stand-up comedy.[27] Essentially, the most highly paid professional storytellers for an adult audience are stand-up comedians. Comedians have a knack for timing and know how to make people laugh with their stories. If that sounds like you, start out by doing open-mic nights and hone your jokes. When you feel comfortable, move on to booking professional gigs at bars and nightclubs.",
                "Get a job as a filmmaker.[28] Film is a powerful medium that engages sight and sound. Almost nothing can compare with the ability of film to inspire, excite, and convince us to suspend our disbelief. Becoming a filmmaker usually requires at least a four-year degree in film. You can make as many kinds of films as there are kinds of stories: westerns, sci-fi movies, romantic comedies, thrillers, documentaries, and dramas.\n\n\nConsult with the film’s writer to talk about their vision for the script and characters. How do they see various lines of dialogue being delivered? How do they imagine the characters moving and the sets looking? Since films almost always begin as a screenplay, use that as your bible and integrate the writer’s vision into your filmmaking process.\nMake shorter films first to get a feel for how the medium works. Most phones have a video function and can be a great first camera for a young amateur filmmaker.\nGet a production internship with a film studio to learn how the industry works. Continue developing your filmmaking abilities with new projects and developing new contacts with actors, producers, and studio executives.",
                "Consider becoming a musician or adding music to your story. Singer-songwriters set stories to music and can use the rhythm and volume of their music to add gravitas to their storytelling process. Whether you rock out with a whole band behind you or simply strap on an acoustic guitar, music can be an effective storytelling medium.\n\n\nAnother community of professional storytellers includes those who tell their stories with a guitar, drums, or other musical instrument.[29] Including music in the narrative can get both children and adults involved in clapping or singing along to your story. Musical storytelling can also constitute an important educational tool by providing new linguistic structures to young children.\nThink about adopting a spoken-word storytelling style. While spoken-word storytelling requires no musical instruments, it does require a sense of timing, rhythm, and (often, though not always) rhyme. Look for opportunities to perform at open-mic nights in your local coffee shops and bookstores.",
                "Become a religious officiant. If you are a religious individual, you might feel called to put your storytelling skills to use in the service to your higher power. Priests, imams, and rabbis don’t just recite ancient passages from their holy books. They must prepare innovative sermons and stories for their congregations. Storytelling is integral to keeping their attendees engaged the religious service.[30][31]"

        "How to Love Your Dog": {
            "intro": "While loving your dog might seem like a simple concept, there's more to than adoring him and spoiling him with treats and toys. Loving your dog is about building a strong bond with him and acting in his best interest. A well-loved dog will feel safe, cherished, and secure, yet still know and follow the rules of canine citizenship. If you take the right steps, you can remain in charge while still having a friendly relationship with your dog.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Know how to nurture your dog. Create rules and enforce them to show your dog that you love him. Rules and expectations will help your dog know what behavior is acceptable and what isn't. This way he won't have to worry about when he may or may not get in trouble. Your dog will know he's loved, because he feels safe in the knowledge that you're in charge and taking care of him.[2]\n\nPart of nurturing your dog is rewarding your dog's good behavior with food, attention, or play, and knowing how to correct bad behavior. This way, he won't repeat the action.",
                "Recognize the importance of boundaries. Since your dog will share your home, he needs to understand your rules and expectations, such as where to toilet, not chewing furniture, and not stealing food off of the table. If you don't set limits, your dog will find yours by doing something that upsets you. Setting boundaries also helps him cope with the outside world, making him less likely to act out dangerously.[3]\n\nFor example, if you don't set boundaries, don't be surprised if your dog one day tries to bite your partner or chews your favorite designer handbag.",
                "Consistently enforce rules. When you notice your dog breaking a rule, don't just ignore it sometimes and enforce it other times. This will send a confusing message to your dog, so that when you do correct him, he'll become conflicted and distressed. He may even challenge you by growling or attempting to bite.[4]\n\nFor example, if your dog is breaking a \"no dog on the sofa\" rule, distract him so he jumps down, then reward the good behavior of getting down. You may distract him by playing with his favorite toy or dropping a treat on the floor.\nIf the dog disobeys you again, you may need to put a leash on him in the house to keep him off the sofa. Or, you may need to put him out of the room, withdrawing attention.",
                "Read your dog's body language. Start paying attention to your dog's body language in order to understand your dog better and what he's trying to tell you. For example, pay attention to signs that your dog feels uncomfortable. His head will lower, he'll glance away, cower down, and tuck his tail low. This will tell you that he's stressed and help you respond to his discomfort.[5]\n\nBy understanding how your dog feels, you can react appropriately by removing the dog from what's scaring him, distracting him with some training exercises, or backing away and reducing the pressure on your dog.",
                "Cherish your dog. Always respect your dog and the love that your dog has brought into the house. Be kind, caring and considerate in the way that you treat your dog. Your dog is a family member. Dogs read a lot into your tone of voice, so speak kindly to him and he will understand your intentions.[6]\n\nMake your dog feel secure by never fighting with your family in front of the dog. Watching an argument may distress him.",
                "Spend quality time talking with your dog. Your dog loves getting attention from you. Every day, set aside some time to spend with your dog, even if you're just watching TV together or stroking your dog's ears and resting. Make sure to talk to him, which will help develop your own language together. You might also encourage your kids or family members to read to your dog. Don't forget to rub, scratch, or massage your dog's tummy. This is a great way to show your love.\n\n\nIf your dog puts his head in your lap, it's not because he wants you to scratch behind his ears. He's actually trying to figure out where you've been, who you've been with, and what you just ate.",
                "Establish a routine. Routines give a dog a sense of stability,which makes them feel more secure. He doesn't have to worry about future meals or walks because they always occur at set times. In a dog's world, routine means knowing what time he gets up, goes for a walk, has his meals, and when he's groomed. Having those things happen at a predictable time shows your love for your pet.[7]\n\nExperts believe that a grieving or depressed dog can be cheered up by enforcing a routine rather than deviating from it.",
                "Feed your dog a nutritious diet. While your dog may enjoy treats, this doesn't mean he should always get them, instead of nutritious food. Instead, talk with your veterinarian about recommending a healthy dog food and correct amount to feed your dog. This way, your dog gets the vitamins and minerals he needs to thrive.[8]\n\nBy caring for your dog's health and only occasionally rewarding him with treats, you show him that you care.",
                "Give your dog a comfortable place of his own. Make sure your dog has his own sleeping area that's set out of the way of people or storage. This will give your dog a space to withdraw to if he's simply had enough and needs to relax or calm down. He should have a den or safe place that contains a comfortable bed.[9][10]\n\nConsider crate training him, which gives your dog a space to lie down in. You may want to partially cover the crate, so it's secluded and he can feel like he's in a den. This will help him relax when he's overwhelmed or tired.",
                "Give your dog plenty of exercise. Depending on your dog's breed, being cooped up could potentially drive him crazy. Working and herding dogs typically have a lot of energy, and that energy needs to go somewhere productive and fun. Play fetch to get your dog running around or go for a walk (or jog, if you both like a challenge). Walks also give a dog a chance to see their world and sniff around as dogs naturally do.</ref>\n\n\nA well-exercised dog is a fulfilled dog, who is far less like to have behavioral issues such as destructiveness or disobedience.\nSmall dogs have a lot of energy, but it is quickly used up. A short walk should give a small dog enough exercise for the day.\nDogs with thicker builds are typically more sedentary and will be less interested in exercise. Still, it's good to get them outside once in a while.",
                "Have regular training sessions. Look into reward-based training programs. Try to do two 10 to 20 minute training sessions every day and make them fun. If your dog doesn't already know them, start with the basics like, \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\" Your dog will love earning rewards and showing off his skills to other people when he learns a trick.[11]\n\nTraining keeps dogs mentally stimulated and is a great chance for some one-on-one attention, which they love. Keeping your dog mentally active is a great way to show you love him, because it adds purpose and stimulation to his life, and helps him look forward to each day.",
                "Reward your dog. Let your dog know he's behaving well by rewarding him with small food treats, extra praise, or a game with a favorite toy. If you give food treats, choose ones that are healthy and made specially for dogs. Or, you can make them at home.

        "How to Calculate Annuity Payments": {
            "intro": "An annuity is an insurance contract that takes the form of an investment, providing an income source with periodic payments for an agreed-upon period of time for the annuitant or their beneficiary, beginning now or at some point in the future. It can be an effective addition to a retirement portfolio, but it can also be confusing. Understanding how your annuity works and the income you can count on from it will help you plan for the future and adjust your other investments accordingly. The Steps below will show you how to calculate annuity payments and accurately estimate future income.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine the type of payout of your annuity. Check your paperwork or call the issuing firm to find out whether your payout is immediate or deferred. If it is an immediate annuity, the payments will begin immediately after your initial investment. If you have a deferred annuity, it will accumulate regular rates of interest.[1]",
                "Determine the investment type of your annuity. Your investment may be fixed or variable—you can also check your paperwork or call the issuing firm to find out this information. A fixed annuity will have a guaranteed rate of interest, and therefore a guaranteed payout. A variable annuity depends heavily on the performance of its underlying investments and therefore offers payouts that may vary from month to month. You choose the investments at the time you purchase the annuity. This annuity is also tax-deferred.[2][3]",
                "Know your liquidity options. Check your annuity contract or call the issuing firm to find out your annuity's liquidity options—it may have penalties for early withdrawal. Some annuities with withdrawal penalties may allow you to withdraw a portion without penalty, however, while other annuities may be available without any withdrawal penalty, such as no-surrender or level-load annuities.[4]",
                "Find out your annuity's payout option. The most popular payout option pays the full amount of the annuity over a specified period, with any balance remaining after your death being paid to your beneficiary. Other options will pay out until death with no beneficiary or pay out for a certain period including payments to your beneficiary for the duration of the period after your death. Still another option pays out to the beneficiary for the duration of his or her life beyond your own.[5]",
                "Find out the principal balance. Your principal balance is the amount you pay to purchase the annuity either as an initial payment or as a monthly contribution (such as from your paycheck).[6] If you make payments on a regular basis, you will have to inquire as to the current balance in order to calculate your payments.\n\n\nYou should also receive statements on your annuity, which should list your principal balance.",
                "Find out the interest rate. There may be a guaranteed minimum interest rate that you may receive when you purchase your annuity, which means your interest rate will never fall beneath that rate.[7] Otherwise, a fixed rate should be noted in the paperwork you received when you purchased the annuity, or, if it is variable, you should be able to call the provider or check your account online to find your interest rate.\n\n\nYour statement should also list your interest rate.",
                "Calculate the amount of the payments based on your specific situation. For example, assume a $500,000 annuity with a 4% interest rate that will pay a fixed annual amount over the next 25 years. The manual formula is Annuity Value = Payment Amount x Present Value of an Annuity (PVOA) factor.[8] A PVOA chart is available here.\n\n\nThe PVOA factor for the above scenario is 15.62208. Thus, 500,000 = Annual Payment x 15.62208. Solving the equation for the annual payment gives us $32,005.98.\nYou can also calculate your payment amount in Excel using the \"PMT\" function. The syntax is \"=PMT(Interest rate,Number of periods,PresentValue,FutureValue).\" For the above example, type \"=PMT(0.04,25,500000,0)\" in a cell and press \"Enter.\" There should be no spaces used in the function. Excel returns the value of $32,005.98.",
                "Adjust your calculation if your annuity will not begin paying out for several years. Find the future value of your present principal balance by using a Future Value table,[9] the rate of interest that will accrue on your annuity between now and when it begins to pay out, and the number of years until you begin drawing payments. For instance, assume that your $500,000 will earn 2% annual interest until it begins paying out in 20 years. Multiply 500,000 by 1.48595 as per the FV factor table to find 742,975. Future values are created using mathematical equations—you can find a link to a table here.\n\n\nFind the future value in Excel by using the FV function. The syntax is \"=FV(InterestRate,NumberOfPeriods,AdditionalPayments,PresentValue).\" Enter \"0\" for the additional payments variable.\nSubstitute this future value as your annuity balance, and recalculate the payment using the formula \"Annuity Value = Payment Amount x PVOA factor\". Given these variables, your annual payment would be $47,559.29."

You can try printing on metal at home with an inkjet printer or with transfer sheets. Keep in mind that this process will require testing and adjustment to fit with your specific printer requirements.",
            "steps": [
                "Ensure you have an inkjet printer. For this project, the wider the printer and the more flexible the feed, the better. If it has problems printing thick cardstock or stickers, it is unlikely to work.",

                "Take the flashing inside. Apply a large piece of double-sided tape and tape it to a waterproof work surface.",
                "Purchase and use an inkjet pre-coating product, such as Dass pre-coat. You will need an even layer on the top of your flashing before printing.",
                "Apply a thick bead of pre-coat above the sheet of metal flashing. It should be pooled above it so that you can coat it evenly with a coating bar.",
                "Use a pre-made coating bar. It can be wood or plastic, but it is similar to a screen-printing technique.",
                "Place the coating bar above the pre-coat and slide it down over the entire metal piece to coat it evenly. If it doesn’t coat your metal and the surface is flat, you haven’t used enough pre-coat.",
                "Don’t touch the surface once you apply the pre-coat. Pick it up from the sides until the tape comes loose.",
                "Get your image ready to print. Make sure to size it ahead of time and test it. Place your feeder tray bars in the right position for even printing.",
                "Apply double sided tape to a piece of carrier paper the same size as your metal print. Press the flashing down onto it, with the printing side up.",
                "Load the carrier sheet and metal into the feeder tray. Press print. If your printer will not print on metal, you will need to opt for the next part, which is using an inkjet transfer.",

                "Vow to make a change. Forget diet and exercise---the hardest part of losing weight is actually making the decision to do it. You've probably told yourself you're going to lose weight in the past but never followed through; that's because you didn't really mean it. Vowing to make a change means being willing to give up what you want now (unhealthy foods) for something even better (the body you've always wanted). Once you have made an honest promise to yourself to make a change, the weight will take care of itself.",
                "Weigh yourself. If you don't already know how much you weigh, then step on the scale and find out. It's important to know how much you weighed at the start of your journey so that you can better track your progress.\n\n\nUse a digital scale for the most accurate results.\nIt's best to weigh yourself in the morning before you have eaten anything, and with little or no clothing on.\nYou may also find it helpful to take measurements so that you can track inches lost, especially if you plan on gaining muscle (remember that muscle weighs more than fat). Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your arms, legs, chest, waist, and/or hips. Where you measure is up to you, and will depend on your specific weight loss goals and problem areas.",
                "Reduce your caloric intake. When it comes to losing weight, diet is the most important factor. The less food you eat, the more weight you will lose; it's as simple as that. It's important that you're eating enough to sustain yourself, though. Starving yourself will only lead you to have more cravings, binge eat, and eventually fall back into old habits.\n\n\nMany medical experts believe that most adults, regardless of their current weight, will lose weight if they eat about 1,200 calories per day. It may take some trial and error to find your magic number, so be sure to pay attention to how much you're eating in relation to the number on the scale so that you can make the necessary adjustments.\nStart keeping track of the calories in everything you eat, including the things you would normally overlook like salad dressings, cooking sauces, cooking oils, and beverages. Read the nutrition labels on everything you buy and measure out your portion sizes. You can also use online nutritional references like Calorie King and My Fitness Pal to find the calorie content of vegetables, fruit, meat, and other foods that aren't labelled.",
                "Exercise 4-5 days per week. Cardiovascular exercises that increase your heart rate can help burn calories and temporarily speed up your metabolism in the several hours following exercise so that you lose weight more quickly.[1] Keep in mind, though, that exercise alone will not make you lose weight.[2] You absolutely must change your eating habits in order to lose weight.\n\n\nAerobic exercises like jogging, biking, walking, swimming, dancing, and kickboxing are all great for burning calories while improving your overall health. If you are new to exercising, then start off slow and ease yourself into a regular workout routine. It's important to find an exercise that you genuinely enjoy so that you will actually do it every day.\nAim to get at least 20 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 days a week. If you don't have time to exercise every day, then find ways to incorporate more movement into your daily routine by making simple changes like taking the stairs rather than the elevator.\nBuilding muscle through resistance training can also help you lose weight. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns, even at rest.[3] Keep in mind that muscle weighs more than fat, though, so you may want to hold off on resistance training until you have already lost some weight.",
                "Drink eight glasses of water each day. Staying properly hydrated is crucial to maintaining your overall health, but it has also been proven to aid in weight loss.[4] This is perhaps due to the fact that water helps keep your stomach full in between meals and prevent mindless snacking.\n\n\nDrinking water before a meal has been shown to aid in weight loss by reducing the amount of calories consumed during the meal.[5] Try drinking one or two glasses of water 20 minutes before each meal to feel fuller faster.\nIf you don't like the \"taste\" of plain water (even though there's no taste) then infuse your water with lemon juice, lime juice, fruit, or mint leaves to add some flavor.",
                "Keep a diet journal. Studies have found that people who keep track of what they eat by writing it down lose more weight, and keep it off, than those who don't.[6] That's because writing down what you eat holds you more accountable to the decisions you make and helps you notice patterns in your diet so that you can determine what works and what doesn't.\n\n\nBe sure to include the calories in everything you consume. That includes the calories in beverages, oils, dressings, sauces, spices, and garnishes.",
                "Cook your meals at home. Even with the best intentions, eating out can ruin your diet quickly. Cooking meals at home makes it easier to choose healthy options and control your serving sizes. Plus, you'll be saving lots of money by eating at home!\n\n\nWhen you do eat out, you can cut down on calories by asking for sauces and dressings on the side.\nUse cooking sprays rather than olive oil or butter when cooking at home. If you do use olive oil to cook, be sure to measure out how much you are using as one tablespoon contains more than 100 calories.[7]\n\nPack a healthy lunch and bring it with you to work or school, and be sure to include healthy snacks like carrots, celery, and apples to keep you satisfied in between meals.",
                "Allow yourself a cheat day. No matter how committed you are to dieting, it's inevitable to have a slip-up every now and then. For many people, social events like birthday parties or picnics make it difficult to eat healthy--remind yourself that it's okay to indulge every once in a while. Giving up your social life for a diet will make you feel miserable and you'll be tempted to quit before reaching your goals.",
                "Consider weight loss surgery. If you are clinically obese and have serious medical conditions related to being overweight, you might consider bariatric surgery. There are a few different kinds of bariatric surgery, but most methods involve either decreasing the size of the stomach or the length of the small intestine[8] so that patients are forced to eat less.\n\n\nCandidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of 40 or higher, have been overweight for several years, and have never been able to permanently lose weight through diet and exercise.\nTalk to your doctor if you think that you might be a good candidate for weight loss surgery.

Some programs, like Jenny Craig, do most of the work for you by preparing low-calorie meals that you eat throughout the week. Others, like Weight Watchers, teach you how to make your own healthy meal choices using a \"points system\" that is based on caloric intake.\n\n\nWeight loss programs help keep you accountable for the choices you make and allow you to connect with nutritionists and other dieters.",
                "Drink unsweetened tea or coffee in between meals. The caffeine in tea and coffee can help curb your appetite. If you struggle with nighttime snacking, then sip on herbal tea in order to keep your mouth and mind occupied.",
                "Get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived not only inhibits your ability to think and function properly, it can actually increase your appetite and slow down your metabolism.[9] Aim to get at least 7 hours of sleep every night.\n\n\nAdjust your schedule if necessary. If you have to wake up very early for school or work, then slowly get in the habit going to bed earlier each night to compensate.",
                "Tackle stress. Some stress is inevitable, but excess stress releases the hormone cortisol, which is responsible for fat storage, particularly in the midsection.[10] Stress may also be an underlying cause of your overeating, since food has a calming effect for many people. Remember that eating only offers temporary relief from stress and anxiety, but doesn't actually solve any of your problems.\n\n\nOne way you can help relieve the amount of stress you feel on a daily basis is to learn to better manage your time. Avoid procrastinating and saving your tasks for the last minute, and keep your eye on the clock throughout the day so that you aren't constantly rushing to get to where you need to be.\nCleaning your environment can also have a tremendous impact on your stress and frustration. Set time aside every single day to clean up your environment; whether it's your bedroom, your office, your kitchen, your car, etc.\nTake up meditation, yoga, or other relaxation practices to help you stay grounded and relaxed on a daily basis.",
                "Find something to replace food with. Dieting doesn't have to mean constantly feeling miserable or deprived. If food is your main source of joy and comfort, then it's important to find something that you love even more than, or just as much as, eating to keep you feeling satisfied. This might be spending time with friends, indulging in a hobby,  going shopping, playing an instrument or sport, or even just relaxing in front of a movie or in the tub.",
                "Don't weigh yourself every day. The scale is a great way to track your weight loss in the long run, but weighing yourself every day will drive you crazy. Remember that everybody's weight fluctuates a few pounds throughout the day for a variety of reasons, and much of the fluctuation can be attributed to water weight. Weigh yourself twice a week at most."

        "How to Braid Rope": {
            "intro": "Braiding rope gives the material additional durability and makes the finished product more versatile for use in a variety of applications. There are a few different ways you to braid rope when you only have a single strand, or you could join several ropes or strands together to create something even stronger.",
            "steps": [
                "Start with the rope of your choice. A three-strand braid is a very common way to braid, perhaps most associated with a classic schoolgirl hair braid. You can use this technique to make a strong braided rope. Braided ropes are appropriate for use in high-friction situations.[1] You can use more or less any type of rope material for this method, including synthetic rope, natural rope and plastic cords. It just has to be flexible enough that you can work with it. If the ends of your strands are frayed, fuse them before you begin.\n\n\nWith a synthetic rope you can fuse the end by holding it over a candle so that it melts a little and fuses together.[2]\n\nYou can tie twine (dental floss works well) around the end portion of the strand to bind it together. This practice is known as “whipping.”[3]\n\nYou can also use tape to secure the ends of the strands, and prevent fraying.",
                "Bind the three ends together. Use a knot or some tape to securely bind the ends of your three strands. Electrical tape and gaffer tape are good choices, depending on how thick the strands you are using are. Once you have bound the strands together at the left-hand side, stretch out the rest of the rope towards the right-hand end.\n\n\nThe three strands should be lying next to each other and not overlapping to get your starting position.[4]\n\nYou may find it helpful to label the three strands A, B, and C.\nYou could also color-code the strands, or use different colors if you want to make a pattern.",
                "Pass the outside strands across the central one. Start by crossing strand A over the central strand B. The order of strands will now be B, A, C. Next cross the other outside strand across the newly central strand, C over A. Now the order will be B, C, A. This is one basic repetition of the braiding pattern for a three-strand braid.[5]",
                "Repeat the outside to in pattern. Continue repeating this pattern of crossing one outside strand over the central strand, and then crossing the other outside strand over the new central strand.\n\n\nIn this example you would now cross B over C, so that B is the central strand.\nThen you would cross A over B so that A is the central strand.\nYou can continue this pattern until you reach the end of the length of rope.[6]",
                "Tie off the rope. Once you have reached the end of the rope, you can secure the braid by binding the strands together. You can do this by taping the ends together with electrical tape or gaffer, or by tying a strong knot at the end.",
                "Start with flexible cord. This technique requires four pieces of cord with good flexibility, since you will be braiding together multiple strands, so you need to ensure whatever type of rope material you use is flexible enough for you to work with. It will be hard to get a tight braid with something that is too stiff.\n\n\nA four-strand braid is a good choice for a high-friction use, such as in winches and pulleys.[7]\n\nEnsure that each strand is fused at the end, either by melting the end of a synthetic rope, or by tying or taping a natural rope.[8]\n\nThe extra strand over a three-strand brand should make the rope thicker and stronger.",
                "Join the ends together. For this braiding technique, you will need to knot or fuse together four strands of rope. There are a few different ways to do this, but the easiest is to simply tie a knot joining four pieces of rope together at one end. You could also secure them with some electrical tape or gaffer tape.[9]\n\nYou can work with four separate pieces of rope, or you could bend two pieces of rope in half and treat the two ends of one piece as two strands, thereby giving you a total of four strands.\nYou can also use eight strands of rope as long as you work in bunches of two, essentially treating two strands as one.\nFor the sake of this tutorial, the four strands will be labelled as A, B, C, and D. Strands B and C are the centre two strands.",
                "Cross the middle strands together. Cross strand C over strand B. Wrap C around B so that it first crosses over B before eventually winding underneath it and back to its original position in the cluster.\n\n\nWhen you are finished with this step, the ends of all four strands should still be in the same order they were in at the start.\nThe order should be A, B, C, D.[10]",
                "Cross one end over the middle. Bring strand A over strand B. Do not cross A over C. At the end of this step, the order of the strand ends should be B, A, C, D.[11]",
                "Weave the remaining end in. Pass strand D underneath strand C. Bring it up from the other side of C and pass it over Strand A. Do not cross D with B.\n\n\nAt the end of this step, the order of the strand ends should be B, D, A, C.\nYou have completed one braiding block at the conclusion of this step.[12]",
                "Repeat this pattern down the length of the rope. Follow the same pattern used to complete the first braiding block down the length of the rope until you make the braid as long as you need it to be or until you are nearly out of rope.[13]\n\nAt the start of each round, re-label the strands as A, B, C, D according to the order they are now in.\nWrap C around B.\nBring A over B.\nCross D under C and over A.",
                "Join at the other end. Once the braid is complete, you need to join the four strands at the finishing end of the rope. You can fuse them together or create a knot to hold them in place.[14]",
                "Start with a flexible single cord. A single braided rope offers the strength of braided rope, but is more lightweight as it involves only one strand. A synthetic or natural rope could work, but it has to have a high level of flexibility so that you can work with it. A stiffer cord will not really work with this method. It can be any length depending on what you want to use it for.\n\n\nSingle-braided ropes are often used for rigging and pulling and climbing.[15]\n\nDo not use a rope you have made yourself for climbing unless you have had it checked out by an expert who can vouch for its suitability and safety.",
                "Make a loop with the rope. If you are doing a single rope braid, you will be braiding a section of the rope. When you know how long you want the braided section to be, make a loop in the rope that is about that size.\n\n\nYou can do this just by sliding the two ends of the rope towards the centre.\nFor this example, have the right side of the rope above the left side.[16]",
                "Pass one free end through the loop. Once you have your loop, bring the end of the rope from the right-hand end up and through the left-hand side of the loop in an over and under movement. Your main loop should now have a smaller loop on the left-hand side and the right-hand end of the rope should be below the loop.[17]",
                "Twist the loop. Bend the top of the loop down so that it crosses over the bottom end of the original loop. Make this crossover near the first braid of your rope and not toward the open end of the loop. This will create the beginnings of a braid-like pattern and create the hole that you will then pass the right-hand end of the rope through.\n\n\nAs you cross the rope over itself, the original top portion of the loop should cross back over the original bottom portion of the loop, just a short distance away from the new intersection you created.\nAs a result, a new, smaller loop or hole should form just past the original link of your braid.[18]",
                "Pass the end through the newly created hole. Insert the right-hand end of the rope through the hole you just created in the previous step. This action forms another link in the braid.\n\n\nThe right-hand end of the rope will go through the hole by going over the bottom portion of the loop and under the top portion of the loop.\nThe right-hand end should now be angled upward, above the rest of the rope.[19]",
                "Repeat down the length of the rope. You will need to continue making new, small loops from the larger loop by twisting the rope, and then weaving the right-hand end of the rope through the holes that are created. The braid is complete once you no longer have enough of the large loop to work with and use for the creation of new sub-loops.",
                "Tighten the braid. When you twisted the loop for the last time, thread the right-hand end of the rope through the final small loop. Carefully pull on both ends of the rope to tighten the braid.[20]",
                "Start with a flexible single cord. To make a Monkey Braid (or Chain Sinnet) you only need a single strand. Monkey braids can add bulk, or shorten a rope. They are often used as a way to store rope without it getting tangled up.[21] You can use synthetic or natural rope, but ensure that the material is flexible so that you can work with it. Plastic cords tend to be quite stiff, which can prevent you from getting a tight single-strand braid.\n\n\nYou can use a Monkey Braid to make a nice looking chain, which returns to a straight rope when pulled.\nYou often see these braids on dress uniforms.",
                "Make a loop. For this technique you need to start by making a loop in the rope by pushing the right-hand end of the rope towards the left-hand until a loop pops up. The point where this loop starts will be where the braid starts so ensure that the loops start near to the left-hand end of the rope.[22]",
                "Push the long side through the loop. Once you have a loop you need to take the rope from the long end (the right-hand side) and push it through the loop. You are pushing the part of the rope that is closest to the loop on the right-hand side. Only use a small section of the rope.[23]\n\nYou should be pulling a small U-shaped portion of rope through your initial loop to create a second loop.\nPull it down, through the loop and out, tugging it toward the working side of the rope to tighten it slightly.\nNote that it is easier to tighten each loop as you work when using this braiding method. Trying to tighten the loops once you finish the entire braid can cause the braid to be loose and uneven overall.",
                "Turn the u-shaped part into a new loop. Once you have pulled the u-shaped part of rope through the loop pull it to the right hand side so that is in line with the braid and the loop that you just pulled it through.[24]",
                "Create another loop. Pinch another section of rope from the working end (the right-hand side), again making sure that it is directly next to the loop you just created. Push it under, through, and out of the loop on the end of the braid, tugging gently to secure it.[25]",
                "Repeat through the length of the rope. The rest of the braid is completed simply by making new loops from the working side of the rope and pulling those loops the larger loops. Pinch another section of rope from the working end. Push this section under and through the previous loop made in the rope.\n\n\nRepeat this as necessary down the length of the rope.[26]",
                "Pass the end through the final loop. When you have enough braids in the rope, create one special final loop to pass the finishing end through. To create a locking loop at the end pass the working end (right-hand end) of the rope over the top side of the last loop and through it.[27] Pull snug on both loose ends of the rope to tighten the braid securely."

        "wikiHow to Remove Emblems From Cars": {
            "intro": "Most car emblems consist of the make, model, trim level, and possibly the dealership's logo. Older cars have emblems stuck on through holes in the sheet metal, but today most emblems are attached using a strong adhesive that is safe for paint. To safely remove car emblems you'll need to loosen and cut through some of the adhesive. Wash and wax the paint once the emblem has been removed to protect the newly exposed paint from the elements.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine how the emblems are attached to the vehicle. Emblems or badges can be attached to your vehicle in a few ways. Most emblems are held in place by using a strong adhesive, but some are secured from the inside via a hole in the body of the vehicle. If there is a hole, you will need to have the hole filled by a professional mechanic, then have the entire area of the vehicle repainted.[1]\n\nTry referring to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle to see how the emblems are replaced to see how they are fastened.\nYou can also try using an internet search for your specific car, followed by “shave emblems” or “remove badges” to see pictures of other people removing theirs so see how they are secured.\nIf the emblems are not secured with adhesive, you will need a professional body shop to remove them.",
                "Use hot water to soften the adhesive. To soften the glue securing the emblem to the vehicle, try pouring hot water directly onto the body of the car just above the emblem itself. The water does not need to be boiling, but should be as hot as possible without risking burning yourself.[2]\n\nMicrowave a bowl of water for a minute, then pour it onto the body of the car above the badge.\nPour the water above the emblem so it runs along the body and into the glue behind the emblem.",
                "Spray adhesive remover onto the glue. Instead of hot water, you can also try using an adhesive remover. Spray the adhesive remover onto the body of the car just above the emblem, then spray it around the rest of the edges of the emblem to soften the adhesive on all sides.[3]\n\nAdhesive remover can damage the clear coat on the paint, so avoid spraying it too liberally around the vehicle.\nLeave the adhesive remover on as you remove the emblems to help eat away at the adhesives.",
                "Use a hair dryer to warm up the glue. You can also loosen the grip of the adhesive by warming it up using a hair dryer. Plug the hair dryer in and set it to the hottest setting. Point the hair dryer directly at the badge and sweep it back and forth along the length of the badge if it’s longer than the nose of the hair dryer.[4]\n\nKeep the hair dryer on the emblem for a few minutes, or until the adhesive begins to get tacky.\nCheck the strength of the adhesive by running a fingernail along the edge of the emblem. If you can press your fingernail into the adhesive, it is warm enough.",
                "Use a plastic wedge to pry the emblem off. Place a thin plastic wedge against the body of the vehicle directly above, below, or to the side of the emblem. Slide the wedge beneath the badge and into the glue. You may need to do it from multiple angles to loosen the emblem sufficiently. You can then either pry the emblem off, or use another method to cut through the adhesive in the middle.[5]\n\nIf you pry the emblem off, it may break. If you intend to throw the emblems away after, this method is fine.\nIf you would like to keep the emblems, try using another method to cut through the glue in the middle.",
                "Cut the adhesive with dental floss or fishing line. Cut a length of fishing line or dental floss that is about eight inches long. Wrap each end around the index fingers on each of your hands, then press the line against the body of the vehicle. Slide it down behind the emblem and pull the line to the left and right in a sawing motion as it passes beneath the emblem and through the adhesive.[6]\n\nThis method offers the best chances of removing the badge completely intact.\nIf the dental floss breaks, cut another length of it and repeat the process until you are through.",
                "Remove the emblem using a credit card.. You can also use a credit card in place of a plastic wedge or wire. Slide the credit card behind the emblem and continue to work it through the softened adhesive until it is loose enough to remove.[7]\n\nMake sure to face the credit card out, toward yourself, so the letters don’t scratch the paint.\nIf you would like to keep the emblem, try to remove as much glue as possible before pulling the emblem off.",
                "Spray adhesive remover on the leftover glue. Once the emblem is off of the vehicle, spray adhesive removed on the bits of glue that remain on the body of the car. Allow the adhesive remover to sit for a minute, then wipe the area clean with a rag.[8]\n\nYou may need to apply adhesive remover more than once to remove all of the glue.",
                "Use soap and water to wash the area. With all the glue removed, fill a bucket with water and automotive soap. Spray the area with a hose, then wash it thoroughly with a sponge and the soapy water. Once done, rinse the area again.[9]\n\nYou want to be sure you remove all of the adhesive remover you sprayed onto the paint.\nDo this step soon after removing the glue to ensure the adhesive remover doesn’t damage the paint.",
                "Wait until the area is completely dry. After you washed the area thoroughly, allow it to dry completely. You may speed the process along by using a towel to dry it, but be sure there are no water droplets or moisture left or it can make it take longer to wax.[10]\n\nIt can take a few hours to dry if you don’t dry it yourself.",
                "Keep the vehicle out of direct sunlight. You should never wax a vehicle in direct sunlight, so you may need to move the vehicle so the area you wax the car is under shade. Sunlight can dry the wax to the paint too quickly.[11]\n\nParking the vehicle in a garage is the best way to do this, but if necessary, you can just park it so the area you removed the emblem from is under shade.\nBecause the area beneath the emblem has no wax and likely limited clear coat on it, you will need to apply wax to protect the paint.",
                "Use a circular motion to apply the wax. Use the supplied wax applicator sponge to apply the wax to the area the emblem used to be. Use a circular motion when applying the wax and ensure you cover any part of the paint that the adhesive remover was sprayed onto or may have dripped on. [12]\n\nYou may choose to wax the entire portion of the car to ensure the wax cover is uniform.\nYou don’t need to apply too much wax, just a light coat.",
                "Allow the wax to dry completely. It may take anywhere from thirty minutes to a few hours for the wax to dry completely. Check the dryness of the wax periodically by touching the area with your finger. If the wax rubs off easily under a single finger, it is dry. [13]\n\nMany waxes will turn white as they dry, making it easier to determine if it’s ready to be buffed off.",
                "Buff the wax off with a chamois towel. Once the wax is dry, buff it off of the paint using a chamois towel. Be sure to buff off all of the wax completely. Beneath the wax, the paint will be shiny and protected from the elements. [14]\n\nBe sure to use a chamois towel. More abrasive towels can scratch the wax coating you just applied to the paint.\nYou can apply another coat of wax if the area still isn’t as shiny as the rest of the car."

        "How to Do Your Makeup": {
            "intro": "While makeup is not required, many people choose to wear it to feel more confident about themselves. Knowing how to apply makeup properly is important for many reasons. Not only can it help you achieve the look you want, but it can help your look last much longer. Whether you are going for a natural look, or a dramatic one, the steps will be mostly the same. What really changes are the colors you use, and how much you put on.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash your face, then apply some toner and moisturizer. Makeup can clog pores, so it is important to start with a clean face. Toner will help close your pores, while moisturizer will smooth out your skin and make it easier to apply foundation. It will also prevent your skin from drying out and flaking beneath your foundation.\n\nWhen applying moisturizer, focus on areas that dry out the most, such as the forehead and cheeks.\nIt would be a good idea to use moisturizer even if you have oily skin. Choose a light-weight, gel-based formula meant for oily skin types.\nIf you have very dry skin, basic moisturizer may not be enough for you. Choose a rich, cream-based formula that is meant for dry skin.",
                "Consider applying some primer. While not essential, primer can really take your makeup to the next level. A little bit goes a long way, so you do not need a lot to cover your face. It helps reduce shine and fill in large pores or fine wrinkles, making it great for photoshoots and special events. Most formulas do not clog pores.",
                "Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone. Foundation comes in many different forms, including powder, liquid, and cream. Powder foundation (loose or pressed) is best for oily skin, while liquid or cream foundation is best for dry skin. Normal or combination skin can use any formula they want.[1] In the end, however, you should choose whatever you feel most comfortable with.\n\n\nSome foundations come in warm and cool shades. These shades relate to skin undertone, and can help you achieve an even closer match.\nThe thicker the formula, the more coverage it will have. For a lighter, more natural look, try BB cream instead.",
                "Apply your foundation over your face. Start by dabbing or brushing it onto your nose, chin, and forehead. Next, blend it outward towards your jaw and hairline for a smooth, seamless finish. Use a foundation brush or sponge if you are using liquid or cream-based foundation, and a powder brush if you are using a powder-based foundation.",
                "Apply some concealer, if desired. It is not a required part of the daily makeup regime, but it can help you feel better if you feel insecure about things like pimples, birthmarks, and under-eyeshadows. Choose a shade that matches your skin tone for the most natural look.[2] How you apply it will depend on what you plan on covering: [3]\n\nTo cover up under-eyeshadows: apply your concealer in an upside-down triangle shape, extending it all the way down to the tops of your cheeks. Gently blend it in using your ring finger or a blending sponge.\nTo cover up extra-dark under-eyeshadows, apply an orange or peach-toned concealer first, then apply your usual concealer on top.\nTo cover up pimples: use a dab of green concealer first to cancel the red tones, then your usual concealer on top of that. Apply it with a mini sponge applicator or brush, then blend it in with a clean mini-sponge applicator using tapping motions.",
                "Finish off with some setting powder or setting spray. This will not only help your makeup last longer, but it will also help reduce shine and give you a smoother finish. Setting spray can simply be sprayed on, while setting powder needs to be dusted on with a soft, fluffy, powder brush.\n\nOnly apply a light layer. The idea is to finish smoothing your complexion, not to create a mask of cosmetics.\nIf you accidentally used too much setting powder, use a clean powder brush to dust the excess off.[4]",
                "Consider brushing on some bronzer for a natural, sun-kissed look. Bronzer can be used on its own, without blush, or in conjunction with blush for a sun-kissed look. You can also skip the bronzer altogether, and move on straight to the blush. To get the most control over your bronzer, choose a brush with soft, short bristles. Be sure to blend it in well. If it is still too harsh, smooth it out with some translucent powder.[5]\n\nIf you choose to use blush alongside your blush, apply along the hairline/upper forehead area, into the hollows of your cheeks, and just under your jaw.[6]\n\nIf you choose to use bronzer instead of blush, apply it to the places that the sun would naturally hit: the tops of your cheeks, your forehead, the bridge of your nose, and your chin. Some people also like to dust some bronzer under their neck to brighten the area, especially if it looks grey.[7]",
                "Choose your blush. Like foundation, blush comes in many different formulas, including powder, cream, and gel/stains. Powder blushes are best for oily skin types while creams are better for dry skin types. Gel-based formulas (including stains) last the longest.[8] Here are some tips on selecting blush:[9]\n\nIf you have fair skin, go for rosy pinks and peaches, and avoid anything too brownish.\nIf you have medium-toned skin, you can use most pinks and peaches. If you have a cooler skin tone, you could also use something mauve-toned.\nIf you have dark skin, try corals, oranges, berries, or rich bronzes. Stay away from blue or light-toned blushes, or your skin will look ashy.",
                "Apply the blush. How you apply the blush depends on what formula you chose. Powder-based blushes should be applied with a powdered brush, while cream and gel-based formulas can be applied with your fingers. Blush should typically be applied at an angle, starting at the apply of your cheek and going up towards your temple. You can also use blush to contour or shape your face, however. For example:[10]\n\nIf you have a round face, and wish to slim it down: suck in your cheeks, then apply the blush to the hollows. Extend the blush up to your temples\nIf you have a heart-shaped face that you'd like to balance out: apply the blush just below the apples of your cheeks, then blend it towards your hairline.\nIf you have a long face that you'd like to soften, apply blush just below the apples of your cheeks and blend it in, but don't extend it towards your temples.",
                "Set your look with more setting powder or setting spray. This will help prevent your blush and/or bronzer from rubbing off or fading. It will also cover any areas that you might have missed earlier.",
                "Apply some eyeshadow primer, if desired. Eyeshadow primers help even out your eyelids and make it easier to apply your eyeshadow. They can help your eyeshadow appear brighter and last longer. Apply the primer over the entire area between your eyebrow and upper lash line.",
                "Choose your eyeshadow shades. The colors themselves don't matter, as long as you have a light shimmery shade, a light matte shade, a medium shade, and a dark shade.[11] You can use the same color palette for a unified look, or contrasting colors for something more dramatic.\n\n\nFor a natural look, choose a neutral palette with lots of creams and browns.\nFor an evening look, consider something more elegant, such as silver or gold.\nDon't be afraid to try other colors, such as green, blue, or brown.\nTo make your eyes stand out, choose colors that contrast it. For example, if you have brown eyes, choose blues, greens, or purples. If you have blue eyes, try copper or gold.",
                "Apply a medium shade over your entire eyelid using a soft eyeshadow brush. Start along your lash line, and blend it up towards your eyebrow. This shade should be close to your skin tone—not too light and not too dark. It can be matte for a natural look, or shimmery for something more dramatic.\n\n\nIf you want to go super-simple, you can stop doing your eyeshadow right here. If you want to get fancier, then keep reading!",
                "Soften any harshness by blending a light, matte shade beneath your eyebrow. Apply the shade with your eyeshadow brush first, then blend it in using a blending brush. Focus more on the outer part of your eye rather than the inner.",
                "Add some dimension by apply a darker shade into the crease using a creasing brush. This should be the darkest color from your chosen palette. For a smokier effect, extend some of the shadow to outer corner of your eye with a thin brush. Blend the shadow into the outer corner of your eye to create a < or > shape. Focus on the outer portion of your eye, and avoid extending it to the inner corners.\n\n\nFor a smoky look, apply some of your dark shade to your lower lashes.",
                "Pat a light, shimmery shade to your brow bone and the inner corners of your eyes. This should be the lightest color from your palette. White or a very pale color will work best for this. The lightness and the shimmer will help open up your eyes and make them look larger and brighter.",
                "Apply some eyeliner to enhance your eye shape. Tilt your head back and lower your eyelid. Gaze into a mirror, and carefully run your eyeliner along your lash line. If you are having too much trouble, gently pull on the outer corner of your eye. Keep in mind that this is not recommended, because it puts too much strain on the fragile skin around you eyes, and could lead to wrinkles.[12]\n\nFor daytime looks, use a slightly lighter and more natural shade of liner, like a gray or brown.\nFor a more natural look, use a pencil eyeliner, in brown or soft black. Smudge it slightly to soften any harsh lines.\nFor a dramatic look, try liquid liner in black. Consider adding a wingtip by extending the eyeliner just past the outer corner of your eye.",
                "Finish off with mascara if you wish to make your lashes look longer and fuller. Choose a mascara that lengthens and volumizes. Brush the mascara on starting from the base of your lashes. Work your way to the ends of your lashes using short, zigzag motions.\n\nFor a natural look, choose a dark brown or soft black mascara, and apply it only to the upper lash line. This creates a more subtle look.\nTo an evening look, apply some mascara to both your upper and lower lashes. Choose a mascara that lengthens and volumizes.",
                "Start with lip balm to moisturize your lips. Not only will this make your lips appear fuller, but it will also help make them appear smoother.[13] If you want to go with a more natural look, you can stick with just tinted lip balm and call it a day. If you want to get more fancy, keep reading!\n\n\nIf your lips are really chapped, consider exfoliating them with a toothbrush or with a sugar lip scrub.",
                "Choose your lipstick color and lip liner color. You can choose whatever color you want, but make sure that they match. For a more natural look, consider something nude-colored or something that is one or two shades richer than your natural lip color; avoid anything too shimmery. For a more dramatic look, consider something bright and bold, such as red. Shimmery colors also work well for the dramatic look.\n\n\nIf you decided to go fancy/dramatic with your eyes, choose a neutral shade. This will prevent your lips from overpowering your eyes.",
                "Outline your lips with lip liner. Not only will this define your lips, but it will help keep your lipstick from bleeding.[14] If you want to make your lips appear fuller, you can extend your lip liner just past your natural lip line; don't get carried away, however, or your lips will look fake!",
                "Fill your lips in with lip liner. This step is often overlooked, but it is an important one. It helps make your lipstick last longer because it gives it something to stick to. It also makes the color richer. Lastly, it makes any fading less noticeable.",
                "Apply your lipstick. You can apply the lipstick straight from the tube, but a lipstick brush will give your more control. Do not extend the lipstick past the lip liner.",
                "Blot your lipstick, apply a second layer, then blot again. This will help make your lipstick last longer. Simply fold a tissue in half, and gently press your lips around it. Reapply your lipstick the same way as before, and then blot it once more.[15]\n\nCheck your teeth for any lipstick that might have smudged onto them. If you find any smudges, wipe them off with a tissue.",
                "Make your lipstick last longer. This is not completely necessary, but it will make your life a lot easier—you also won't have to reapply or touch up your lipstick as often! Start by pulling a tissue apart so that you have a very thin tissue. Place the tissue over your lips, then gently tap your lips with setting powder; use a soft, fluffy powder brush to do this. Pull the tissue away when you are done, then discard it.",
                "Finish off with a coat of lip gloss, if desired. This can help make your lips appear fuller. Instead of applying the lip gloss all over your lips, simply tap it onto the center of your lips where the light hits them."

            "intro": "Painting ceramic items is a fun and inexpensive way to refresh old home décor or create a personalized gift or centerpiece. Read these steps to learn all you need to know about painting ceramic in your own home.",
            "steps": [
                "Pick your paint. Depending on how you plan to use your ceramic, there are a few slightly different approaches to picking paint, each of which will yield a different result in terms of appearance, durability, and usability.\n\n\nUsing regular paint (such as acrylic) plus an acrylic clear coat will produce highly glossy dishes that are pretty to look at, but not safe to eat off of.\nUsing a no-bake ceramic paint pen will allow easy, quick designs on dishes that are safe to eat and drink from, but which won't last with sustained regular use.\nUsing bake-on ceramic paint will produce fairly glossy patterns that are safe to eat and drink from, and that in most cases should last for years.",
                "Choose a brush or pen. Once you've decided on your paint approach, acquire a brush suitable for the pattern you want to paint, or consider a paint pen. A paint pen will allow you to “draw” the paint on like a marker, making it great for words and line drawings, but its applications aren't as flexible overall.\n\n\nA small, pointed brush is perfect for painting flower buds and vines.\nA flat-tipped brush is ideal for geometric work such as rims and straight lines, as well as for filling in larger areas of paint. If you plan to stencil in a design, a small flat-tipped brush is also probably the best choice.",
                "Purchase any other supplies you need. Buy clear coat for decorative dishes; pick up some painter's tape or masking tape if you want to paint straight lines or angles. A smock or apron and some disposable gloves are also useful in many cases.",
                "Paint your dish. With your dish thorough clean and dry, apply your chosen paint to it to create whatever design you want. The specifics of this step will vary somewhat between the different types of paint, but the basics involve brushing on designs with acrylic or bake-on ceramic paint. Using a small brush, paint your design on the ceramic dish.\n\n\nTo paint flower buds or leaves, use a pointed brush. Apply a tiny blob of paint to the dish where the base of the bud or leaf will be, and then drag and lift the brush in the direction of the tip of the bud or leaf. The tip will be created wherever you pull the brush away from the plate.\nTo paint straight lines across a plate or bowl, tape off the area on either side of where you want each line to be with painter's tape. (Use a ruler to ensure that the gap between the tape strips is evenly spaced.) Paint between the tape lines with bold strokes using a flat-tipped brush, then gently remove the tape to leave a clean line.\nFor an unusual motif reminiscent of the De Stijl art movement of the early 20th century, try blocking off rectangular sections with criss-crossed lines of painter's tape, and then filling in the sections with different colors of paint. Leave one or two sections unpainted for an eye-popping geometrical effect.\nKnow that acrylic paint can be reapplied after the first coat has dried to make it even brighter. This step isn't usually necessary for ceramic paint.",
                "Draw or write with a no-bake ceramic paint pen, if necessary. These pens are available at many art and craft supply stores, as well as online. They're relatively mess-free, making them ideal for children's parties and other open group activity settings.\n\n\nDraw, write, or doodle just as you would with a colored marker. The paint will dry quickly once applied. If a pen seems not to be writing, hold it with the point angled down and gently shake it for a moment.\nTry drawing a background or part of a picture in one color, letting it dry for a moment, and then adding the next layer in a different color to build a bright, fun image.\nBe sure to add a signature on the bottom of the dish so that everyone knows it's your creation.",
                "Keep breathing. Be sure to paint in an open and well-ventilated area for safety, especially when using acrylic paint. Fumes can be unpleasant and aggravate any existing conditions, such as allergies, that you may have.",
                "Sand your way to success. For dishes that seem too glossy to take paint, consider gently sanding them with an ultra-fine grit sandpaper, such as 1800 or 2000 grit. Don't apply much pressure, and try to sand evenly.\n\n\nThis works because the sandpaper creates microabrasions in the glaze of the dish, allowing paint to stick more easily.\nDon't make the finish visibly rough or jagged. A gentle sanding is more than enough.",
                "Gloss over acrylic paint. If you chose to paint a decorative dish with acrylic, let it dry thoroughly, and then apply clear acrylic topcoat to it. Let one layer dry, and then add a second to be sure it's completely sealed.\n\n\nThis dish will look very shiny and nice, but is not safe for food or drinks. Instead, display it on a shelf or give it is a gift. Be sure to tell the recipient not to use it for eating or drinking.",
                "Bake any ceramic paint. If you chose to paint a dish with special ceramic paint, find an out-of-the-way place to let it dry for at least 24 hours. Once it's dried completely, bake it in a preheated oven according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nAlways yield to the manufacturer's instructions. If they tell you to bake it earlier than this guide, do so.\nThis dish will have a pleasantly glossy finish, and be safe to eat and drink off of. If you chose a high-end ceramic paint that's dishwasher-safe, you can even run it in the dishwasher! The design should remain there for many years to come.\n\nAs with any painted dish, consider hand washing it even if you can technically use the dishwasher. Hand washing is much gentler, and ensures the longest life for your dish.",
                "Use your no-bake ceramic paint dish. If you chose to use no-bake ceramic paint pens to decorate your dish, it's ready to use as soon as the paint dries. No other steps are needed.\n\n\nYour dish will be safe to eat off of, but this paint will scratch and chip over time from contact with utensils, teeth, and other hard edges. It's definitely not dishwasher-safe.",
                "Know your limits. Ceramic tile of the type found in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms, can certainly be painted, but the process is more involved than painting a hobby item like a plate or a lamp base. Additionally, there are practical limits to what can be painted, and how long you can expect your paint job to last.\n\n\nLay out a plan beforehand. When you paint home tile, you'll be decommissioning whatever area of the house you're painting for a while. Plan ahead to avoid awkward bathroom and kitchen situations.\nPaint somewhere sensible. High-traffic areas, and tiles that are constantly subjected to moisture, are not generally considered good candidates for home repainting. At best, expert advice on the subject is ambivalent. Choose to repaint less-trafficked areas of tile, or accept that your project may not last as long as you'd like it to.",
                "Gather your supplies. Painting or repainting ceramic tiles in your home requires considerably more patience and preparation than the other ceramic painting methods described here, but it should go steadily as long as you have the tools you need. Collect the following items:\n\n\nFine grit sandpaper, such as 220 or 240 grit\nAn electric sander, preferably an orbital sander\nHeavy rubber gloves, eye protection, and a face mask\nAbrasive tile cleaner, such as Comet, Ajax (powder), or Bon Ami\nBleach to destroy mildew and other mold\nHigh-adhesion primer designed for glossy surfaces\nHigh-quality acrylic or epoxy paint\nClear urethane or epoxy top coat finish\nA large paintbrush and/or paint roller\nRags and a vacuum cleaner for cleanup",
                "Clean and sand the tile. The first step to repainting your tile is be sure it's ready for new paint. Be sure to wear a face mask and safety goggles for this step, to avoid getting dust in your eyes or respiratory system. If you're worried that 220 grit sandpaper will sand too quickly or too deeply for you to apply it evenly, you can use a finer grit. Just remember that the process is likely to take longer as the grit number goes up.\n\n\nStart with your abrasive tile cleaner. Thoroughly scrub the area you plan to repaint, and wipe it down until it's clean and dry.\nDisinfect. Using a fresh rag, make a bleach solution and scrub through the tiles a second time to kill mold.\nSand down the area. Affix your sandpaper to the orbital sander and sand your tiles down carefully. Your goal is to remove any extra gloss remaining above the ceramic itself, without damaging the ceramic.",
                "Prime the tile. As with painting a lamp, your exposed ceramic tile will need to be primed. Paint the primer on evenly with a brush.\n\n\nChoose the right primer. Apply an oil-based primer to ensure better water protection.\nApply two coats, then finish. Once the first coat has dried a little, apply a second coat of primer over it. Give it time to dry thoroughly (a few hours), then sand it with ultra-fine grit sandpaper, such as 1500 or 2000 grit, to remove any bumps or ridges in the coat.",
                "Choose your paint. Now that your tile is primed and dry, it's time to add paint. Choose the best paint possible. There are three basic options available:\n\n\nEpoxy paint is glossy, highly durable and long-lasting, but also more expensive than most other kinds of paint.\nAcrylic paint isn't as durable for high-traffic areas as epoxy, but is easier to work with and cheaper.\nLatex paint provides a soft-looking, “rubbery” finish that some people prefer, but it's the least durable of the three.",
                "Paint the paint on evenly using a paintbrush. A flat-tipped brush with a fairly wide tip is best. Start with a thin coat, let it dry, and then add a second coat. You'll get brighter and smoother results than a thick one-coat job.\n\n\nRefer to thinning instructions on your paint can to learn how to thin it properly, if thinning is required.\nTo paint a geometric pattern, tape shapes together out of blue painter's tape before you begin, and then use a laser level and a ruler to properly place them evenly throughout your work area. Remove the tape after you're finished (but before you apply a clear coat) to reveal sharp lines and shapes.",
                "Finish the tile. Wait 2-3 days for the paint to dry completely. Once the paint has dried, it's time to apply a clear finish and seal it in. Apply two coats of finish. Wait long enough between coats for the first coat to become dry to the touch. Choose between urethane and epoxy finish. Both have advantages:\n\n\nUrethane finish is cheaper, quicker to apply, and easier to work with. However, it doesn't hold up in high-traffic areas for as long as epoxy.\nEpoxy finish is hard, glossy, and essentially permanent, making it the better choice for areas with a lot of foot traffic or areas that get wet regularly. However, it is more expensive and takes more care to apply properly.",
                "Clean up your mess. Throw away any paper you set out. Vacuum up any remaining dust or detritus. Clean and store your supplies. Let the finish dry fully. Again, 2-3 days is recommended.",
                "Gather your paint and other supplies. To repaint an old ceramic lamp (or other decorative ceramic fixture), you'll be taking four basic steps: sanding, priming, painting, and finishing. To paint a ceramic lamp, spraypaint is the most sensible choice. Many people recommend Krylon-brand spraypaint for its bold color and durability, but other brands are usable as well. In any case, purchase the following supplies for your project:\n\n\nA face mask (surgical mask) and plastic safety goggles\nElectrical tape\n1800-grit or a similar ultra-fine grit sandpaper\nA sanding block to mount the sandpaper\nPaper towels and old newspaper\nA general-purpose spray primer in a neutral color such as dark gray\nSemi-gloss or glossy spraypaint in the color of your choice\nClear gloss spray sealer",
                "Sand your lamp. Unless you're painting a totally unfinished ceramic lamp, the first major step will be to sand its surfaces so that they'll take your primer more readily. To prevent dust from getting into your mouth and nose, wear a face mask before you sand.\n\n\nRemove the lampshade. Remove any other parts of the lamp you can set aside and don't plan to paint. (If there's still a light bulb in the lamp, remove that, too.)\nSand it down. Attach your sandpaper to the sanding block, and sand the entire lamp using gentle, even pressure and smooth strokes.\nDon't over-sand the lamp. It shouldn't be rough or irregular to the touch. The sanding step is only to give the primer a better surface to bind to.",
                "Clean up. Once you've finished, wipe down the lamp with damp paper towels and/or a gentle cleaning agent. Be thorough to ensure you've cleaned all of the sanding dust off the lamp, as well as any other remaining impurities.",
                "Prime your lamp. Once the sanded lamp is clean and dry, it's time to apply primer. Move your project outside or to an open garage or workshop, if you haven't already. Put on safety goggles and a fresh face mask. You'll be working with spraypaint, which can get into your mucous membranes from the air and irritate them.\n\n\nPrep your lamp. Set it on a bed of newspaper that's much wider than the base of the lamp, for easy cleanup. Use electrical tape to firmly seal off any part of the cord or screw base that might otherwise get paint on it, including under the base.\nApply the first coat of primer. Spray it on uniformly and steadily, all around the lamp. Once it's been applied, let it dry for at least 3 or 4 minutes. There's no need to wait more than 10 minutes at most before moving to the next step.\nApply the second coat of primer. Once the first coat is set, repeat the process to add a second coat of primer. This will help ensure a smooth, uniform base for your spraypaint, and should completely obscure any previous colors and patterns on the original lamp as well.",
                "Put on the first coat of paint. Give the primer between 30 minutes and an hour to set somewhat, and then bust out the paint. You'll be applying multiple coats for a great-looking finish.\n\n\nApply the first coat of paint. Using even movements, apply a thin coat of spraypaint over the primed lamp. Chances are, the primer will still be affecting the color somewhat; this is ordinary. Don't over-spray your first coat. You'll get a much brighter and smoother finish by using multiple thin coats.",
                "Wait for the first coat to dry. Advice varies on how dry you should let the first coat get before it's okay to apply the next coat, but the average consensus seems to be between half an hour and 2 hours. This guide recommends waiting 1 hour between coats.\n\n\nSpraypaint actually takes about a day to set completely, but there's no need to wait that long between coats.",
                "Apply the second and third coats of paint, if necessary. Repeat the pattern described above to apply at least 2 more coats of spraypaint. Be sure to keep each coat thin.",
                "Put gloss or sealant on your lamp. Once the last coat of paint has dried enough to take another coat, switch to your sealant and spray it on. For a professional-looking finish, choose a clear, glossy finish such as Krylon No-Scent Glossy.\n\n\nAs with painting, once the first thin coat has dried, add a second coat to maximize the glossy look.\nOnce you're satisfied, protect the lamp from the elements and leave it to dry overnight. Don't touch the lamp during this time if you can help it.",
                "Finish up. The next morning, remove the electrical tape from the lamp and bring it inside. Add a bulb and a shade to complete your lamp.\n\n\nDon't feel bound to use the shade that originally came with the lamp. Look at department and thrift stores to find one that suits you."
