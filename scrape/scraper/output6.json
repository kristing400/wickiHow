        "How to Work for a Wedding Planner": {
            "intro": "Planning a wedding takes approximately 240 hours, so many people hire wedding planners to ease the load. Wedding planners handle all aspects of the lead up and wedding day, as well as auxiliary events. Successful wedding planners often employ assistants to help them work on a number of weddings at once. You generally need approximately 1 year of experience in event or wedding planning in order to get a salaried job with a wedding planner or company. As a wedding planner assistant, you may be asked to attend weddings, produce small functions, arrange services and communicate with wedding parties, among other things. Find out how to work for a wedding planner.",
            "steps": [
                "Become a planner in your own life. Organize small and large birthday parties, anniversaries, school events and community events. You should have a passion for planning functions if you are going to work in event planning.",
                "Develop a passion for weddings. Whether you are inspired by planning your own wedding or enjoy attending weddings, you have to be ready to \"think wedding\" most days of the year. Decide if you can immerse yourself in all aspects of a wedding from formal wear to catering to stationary and everything in between.",
                "Consider getting some formal training. Search for certificate or associate's degree programs in your area. You may be able to attend an intensive course or conference specifically in wedding planning.\n\n\nEducation is not necessary to become an event planner. Most people earn clients by showing their portfolio of past events. However, it may be valuable to show a prospective employer that you have received formal training in wedding and event planning.",
                "Get hired for a job as an entry-level event coordinator. This need not be on a wedding event, necessarily. However, at least 1 year of experience in event coordinator will make you eligible for most wedding planner assistant jobs.",
                "Shadow a wedding planner. Doing a job shadow is helpful for 2 reasons: you can get an up-close view of the daily work involved and you can develop contacts in the industry. Choose 1 of the avenues to find a job shadow opportunity.\n\n\nAsk a wedding planner that you know if you can job shadow them for a day or a week. If you have some open time in your schedule, you may request an unpaid or low-paid internship for a few months in order to learn the ropes.\nLook in the phone book for local wedding planners. Although you may feel uncomfortable calling someone you don't know and asking to shadow them, you will develop contacts in the industry by doing so. Ask if they take on interns as well.\nPost an ad on Craigslist requesting an internship. If possible, take more than 1 internship to gain more contacts in the industry. Getting a job with a wedding planner is often easier by word of mouth than by job posting.\nGo to a mentor site, like PivotPlanet. This job search site allows you to sign up to speak with a wedding planner by web conference. You can set a number of dates to check in and ask questions about jobs, the industry and tips on getting started.",
                "Develop a portfolio. Bring together pictures of events you've put on or helped to produce. Write down the facts about the event and its success.\n\n\nIf you don't have any experience with graphic design, you may want to hire someone to help you with portfolio layouts. Print everything on quality paper, laminate it and stick it in a professional quality envelope.",
                "Network with wedding planners in your area. Attend conferences and bridal fairs, and introduce yourself as a wedding planner assistant. Many people in the wedding industry believe many of these positions are made available informally to contacts rather than posted on job boards.\n\n\nCreate business cards with this title. Bring your portfolio with you, in case you find a job prospect.",
                "Join a professional organization, such as the Wedding Industry Professionals Association (WIPA) or the National Association of Wedding Professionals (NAWP). Network with people on the site, post on their job boards and attend events.\n\n\nNote your professional organization on your business card.",
                "Start a wedding blog. A well-edited wedding blog can show your passion for the industry. Keep on top of the newest wedding fashions and put the site on your business card and portfolio.",
                "Call your contacts and ask if a position is available. Some wedding planners may be willing to offer a trial run of an assistant position. If they are not hiring, ask them to keep your resume on file.",
                "Check Internet job boards regularly. Although there are not always a lot of wedding planner job postings, you may find occasional positions on Craigslist, CareerBuilder, Indeed, SimplyHired or another site.\n\n\nLook for work as both a wedding planning assistant and as a personal assistant to a wedding planner. A planning assistant is likely to work more independently than a personal assistant, but either job is a good entry-level position in the wedding industry.",
                "Apply for project-based/contract work. Let wedding planners know that you'd be willing to aid them when large accounts come along. You will be able to gain experience and prove your worth to prospective employers until you find a full-time position.",
                "Consider moving to a metropolitan area. If you are not finding many job positions and there aren't many wedding planners in your area, then you are less likely to find a planner assistant job. Search job boards in larger cities and move to a more populated or destination wedding area that has more prospects."

        "wikiHow to Wear Red Shoes": {
            "intro": "Nearly every woman could benefit from having a pair of red shoes in her fashion arsenal. Red shoes can punch up the blandest of outfits and make a bold, confident statement. Unfortunately, red shoes can quickly look tacky or inappropriate if worn the wrong way. Use red shoes to add a touch of spice as needed, but resist the temptation to throw them into an already spicy ensemble to prevent red overkill.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for a slinky red stiletto for the ultimate in sexy footwear. If you want a shoe that will leave a lasting impression for a date or big event, a red heel is the way to go. Be careful about what you pair this shoe with, however, since pairing it with too many notably sexy garments can push your look into the realm of trashiness.",
                "Tone things down with a red pump. If you want to wear your red shoes to work or for a casual stroll down the block, a simple red pump is your best bet. Flats are simple enough to subdue wild red into submission.",
                "Find middle ground by choosing a low-heeled pump. Heels can look classy, even if they are red. Closed-toe pumps are your best choice, and you can wear them with both casual and dressy outfits.",
                "Try a different shade of red. If you feel uneasy about wearing a bright red shoe, start out by wearing a deeper shade, like burgundy. A deep shade of red is more subdued and a little less noticeable, which may make you feel more confident about your ability to pull it off.",
                "Match red with neutrals. If black, brown, gray, nude, white, and deep navy blue are the only colors found in your outfit, a neutral shoe will only make your outfit seem duller. Adding a bright red shoe can make your style pop. Try wearing a red pump the next time you throw on a black pencil skirt and white button-down blouse.",
                "Color block. Color blocking is the practice of wearing solid blocks of bright, complementary colors against one another. Try wearing your red shoes against an orange or pink dress.",
                "Avoid wearing red with red. If you have a solid red dress, do not wear it with your red shoes. If you do, you run the risk of overkill. If you would prefer to wear your bright red shoes with a red dress, choose a deep red dress to add depth to your ensemble.",
                "Also avoid wearing red shoes with bright green. Red and green are too closely associated with Christmas, and wearing them together will make your outfit look too seasonal. Instead of a bright green, mix your red shoes with deeper shades like olive.",
                "Wear red shoes with a neutral pattern. Red peep-toe shoes make a good accompaniment to a black and white polka dot dress or pinstripe trousers.",
                "Pair red shoes with patterns that have traces of red in them. While solid red outfits are often overkill with red shoes, a print with traces of red in it coordinates with your shoes in a subtle, appropriate manner.",
                "Wear your red pumps with casual clothes. Red shoes look great against denim blue jeans, especially medium and dark washes. A red pump is an easy way to add a pop of color and a twist of sophistication to your everyday style.",
                "Avoid wearing red shoes with trashy or suggestive pieces. Red shoes are already relatively sexy. Wearing them with ripped jeans, tube tops, cut-off shorts, and other revealing garments does not make you look sexier. Instead of looking confident, it may simply look like you are trying too hard to be noticed.",
                "Wear your red shoes with a conservatively sexy ensemble. If you want to take full advantage of the seductive nature of red stilettos, pair them with an outfit that is subtly, rather than overtly, sultry. For instance, a little black dress with cap sleeves and a hemline that comes down to your knee can be very sexy, even though it shows a modest amount of skin. This makes it a potential candidate for your red high heels.",
                "Resist the temptation to adorn yourself in too many red accessories. You can match your red shoes with red lipstick and a red handbag, but stop there. Do not add a red belt, red scarf, red bracelet, and ruby red ring to the mix. A few red accessories looks coordinated, but too many looks overdone."

        "How to Study Organic Chemistry Effectively": {
            "intro": "Organic chemistry consists of the study of organic molecules, including their formations, reactions, mechanisms of reactions, product formation, and uses.[1] Most of the compounds studied in organic chemistry contain at least one carbon-hydrogen bond. While organic chemistry can be very difficult, you can make it easier with some basic strategies such as knowing the types of reactions and how they occur and using a 3D modeling kit to work out the chemical structures.",
            "steps": [
                "Do practice problems. The number one way to study organic chemistry is by doing practice problems. Problems are what you will see on tests and quizzes and they are how you prove your understanding. The more problems you do, the better your understanding will be. Once you have mastered one concept, move on to problems that are more difficult.[2]\n\nDo a set of practice problems from your book every day to keep up with the material.",
                "Actively review your notes and textbook. Reading through your notes is definitely a good place to start, but actively reviewing your notes is even better. Rewrite your notes and summarize the material. Draw concept maps or visual summaries to illustrate how everything works together.[3]\n\nWhen you come across a compound, draw the structure for it.\nRead through the notes before class every day so that you will know what is coming up.",
                "Ask for help. Your professor and teaching assistants will have office hours that are specifically available for students to ask questions and get help with the material. Take advantage of this time and actually go ask for assistance. They are there to help you learn and this is an opportunity to ask questions you might have been afraid to ask in class.[4]\n\nGetting extra help from a one-on-one tutor can also be beneficial if you are really struggling.",
                "Number your carbons. When answering questions in homework or on an exam, it is easy to lose track of the number of carbons. The number of carbons in the products should always equal the number of carbons in the reactants.[5]\n\nYou don’t have to number the carbons for proper labeling, just number them so you know how many there are and you can put them in the correct position in the products.",
                "Recognize the relationships between properties. Organic chemistry relies heavily on understanding how different molecules relate to each other. While there is rote memorization involved, it is much more important that you understand these basic interactions to succeed in organic chemistry. Understanding the reason behind why these trends exist is also important. To name a few examples:[6]\n\nAs the pKa of an acid increases, the stability of the conjugate base increases.\nAs the polarity of a molecule increases, the boiling point increases.\nWhen you increase the chain length of a hydrocarbon, the boiling point increases.",
                "Use the modeling kits. Modeling kits allow you build chemical structures in three dimensions. Being able to visualize the structure can help you understand a compound better than just looking at the 2D version written on the board.[7]\n\nThe modeling kit helps you avoid mistakes when answering questions on exams and homework.",
                "Use reaction maps for synthesis problems. Reaction maps allow you to visualize all of the functional groups and the reactions that occur to produce them. You can use the reaction maps to string together reactions to get from one compound to the final compound.[8]\n\nOnce you have identified the functional groups in the reaction, work the problem backwards (from product to reactant) using the maps as a guide.",
                "Make flash cards. Organic chemistry is all about learning chemical structures and reactions. There is also a lot of vocabulary that is specific to the subject. It is very difficult to understand the material if you don’t know what all of the words mean. Use flash cards to help you learn the vocabulary.[9]\n\nOnce you have mastered the vocabulary, make new flashcards for reactions and structures.",
                "Form a study group. Study groups are a great way to check your understanding and gain new insight into the material. When explaining a concept to others, you may realize that there is something you were missing. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the material itself. At the same time, other members of the group can help you learn concepts that are difficult for you.[10]\n\nChoose study partners that learn at the same rate you do. If the group is too fast or too slow for you, it won’t be as beneficial.",
                "Write in pen. When using a pencil, it is easy to just write everything down, erase, and then keep writing more. When you use a pen, you have to think through the material critically before writing anything down to avoid having to scribble things out.[11]\n\nWhile this may not work for everyone, it is good to try it out and see if it helps you think ideas through properly before writing them down.",
                "Study every day. Studying for an hour or two each day is a much better use of your time than trying to study for 5+ hours all at once. With smaller, more frequent study sessions, you can focus on individual concepts and not burn yourself out trying to cram all of the information into your brain at once.[12]\n\nBreak up your studying into large and small blocks of time. If you only have ten minutes, flip through some flashcards. If you have an hour or two, do practice problems.",
                "Attend class. This may seem obvious, but a lot of effort put into learning material is just about showing up to class. Paying attention in class and taking relevant notes is also necessary. Be strategic about note-taking. Don’t take notes just to take notes. Listen to what the professor is saying and then summarize the information in your notes.[13]\n\nIf something you wrote during class doesn’t make sense, attend office hours to ask for clarification.",
                "Get proper sleep, exercise, and nutrition. The key to success when studying any subject is to maintain your health.[14] Getting the proper amount of sleep, exercising a few times a week, and keeping a nutritious diet are all necessary to keeping yourself healthy and ready for work. Doing these three things will help keep your energy up and help you maintain the information that you are learning.\n\n\nTry to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\nMake time for exercise, even if it’s just a walk with a friend.\nMake an effort to eat more fruits and vegetables and stay away from sodas and excess caffeine.",
                "Set up a good study space. Choose a study space that works best for you. Do you get more done when there’s absolute silence or when there’s a little bit of background noise? A good study space has plenty of lighting, is a comfortable temperature, has minimal distractions, and is comfortable, but not too comfortable.[15]\n\nMake sure you have plenty of space to spread out.\nKeep your study space stocked with everything you will need (paper, calculator, scissors, snacks, etc.) so you won’t have to go hunting and get distracted."

You can try to blend into your class or try to trick your teacher so you don’t get called on. However, the best way to have a good experience in class is to be prepared for questions.",
            "steps": [
                "Sit strategically. You want to try to sit in the teacher’s blind spot so they hopefully don’t notice you. Where you sit depends on the style of your classroom and your teacher. Try to sit in the edge of the classroom, out of the teacher’s main focus of vision. You can sit in the back to hopefully hide or the very front so the teacher possibly completely looks past you and forgets you are there.[1]\n\nYou can try to sit next to someone who answers a lot of questions to hopefully blend in next to them.[2]",
                "Look toward the front of the classroom. While the teacher is teaching, look toward them. Don’t look out the window, fidget, doodle, or text. At least look like you are paying attention to what they are saying. The teacher might find it disrespectful and think you are not paying attention if you seem distracted.[3]",
                "Have an appropriate balance of eye contact. When your teacher is scanning the room trying to decide who to call on, do not make direct eye contact with the teacher. However, don’t clearly avoid eye contact and definitely don’t look down. Look away for a second then look back at the teacher then look away again. Try to find a good balance between completely avoiding looking at your teacher and looking at them too much.[4]",
                "Look confident. Even if you aren’t confident and have no idea what the answer to the question is, pretend you do. Sit up straight and don’t look worried or nervous. Don’t look eager to answer the question, but don’t look like you clearly were not paying attention either. The teacher will likely call on someone who either seems overly confident or nervous.[5]",
                "Look through your notes. When the teacher is scanning the room, looking for someone to call on, search through your notes. Make it look like you are trying to find the answer and that you remember writing it down. If the teacher sees you searching through your notes, they might not call on you because they know you are trying to find the right answer.[6]",
                "Pretend to write down notes. You should write real notes too, but if you are trying to trick your teacher not to call on you, pretend to write more notes. If the teacher is scanning the room, start writing down notes as if you are writing down a few more points from what the teacher said. The teacher will think you are really concentrating and trying to understand all the points.[7]",
                "Rifle through your bag. When the teacher is deciding who to call on start rifling through your backpack, binder, or pencil case like you are looking for something important. Your teacher will hopefully see that you are focused on needing something urgently and not want to interrupt you.[8]",
                "Make a concentrated face. Look like you are really focused and trying to think of the answer when the teacher is calling on students. If you look like you are concentrating the teacher will assume you were paying attention, but don’t know the answer, so they won’t call on you.\n\n\nYou can also try making a really confused face like you don’t understand the question.[9]",
                "Raise your hand when you do know the answer. When you do know the answer or the question is easy, raise your hand! That way when the question is hard the teacher won’t call on you because you already talked and participated.[10]",
                "Overcome speaking anxiety. If the reason you want to avoid getting called on in class is because you are nervous to talk in front of other people, you might have a speaking anxiety. You can overcome this by being prepared for class and feeling confident and positive.\n\n\nStart your answers strong and don’t mumble.\nPractice speaking in front of smaller groups and then work your way up to talking in class.[11]",
                "Pay attention in class. If you pay attention and concentrate, you will feel a lot more comfortable answering questions in class. When the teacher talks, actively listen and try to process what is being said. Take notes while the teacher talks and sit in the front of the class.[12]\n\nDon’t be on your phone during class. It will distract you and stop you from paying attention.",
                "Do your homework so you are prepared. If you come to class unprepared, you won’t know the answer to any questions. Do any homework assignments before class so you are prepared for any questions that the teacher might ask. If you feel confident, you won’t have to worry about avoiding the teacher and you will have a better experience in class."

            "steps": [
                "Prepare your products around your budget. Determine the best method that will allow you to succeed:\n\n\nCreate wholesale prices to buy them, then list it on eBay for selling.\nExplore drop shipping. This is what most eBay PowerSellers use. PowerSellers rank among the most successful sellers on eBay in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.",
                "Research which items are in demand. eBay Pulse http://pulse.ebay.com is a free tool offered by eBay that will show you the top ten searches on eBay within a particular product category. If, for example, you want to sell digital cameras on eBay then use eBay Pulse to see which cameras people are searching for.",
                "Pinpoint the real wholesalers. There is a big difference between a wholesaler and middleman. With a true wholesaler, you get the best deals and prices. Having a re-seller's certificate is the most important thing to buy a lot of wholesale products at very low affordable prices. True wholesalers like to deal with other legitimate businesses.",
                "Find an adequate, safe and protected place for storing your products. This is very important because sometimes you sell on eBay a product and when you come back to pack it and ship it, you find it damaged if it was not well stored. This will be very disappointing to you as well as to your buyer.",
                "Have a nice place with adequate light to picture your products. This will help you to give accurate description to your listing. accurate descriptions and pictures builds confidence with buyers and make them repeat customers.",
                "Stock on shipping boxes and shipping supplies (tape, bubble wrap, and other necessities). Ensure that you have them readily and available.\n\n\nIf you do decide to purchase them from eBay itself, they are may be cheaper and of good quality and you will get a feedback from the seller which will also help building your reputation.",
                "File packaging tracking numbers. It is not necessary to keep, however, in such cases where the buyer requests it or if something goes astray during the shipping, you will need it.",
                "Advantages of drop-shipping:\n\n\nLower starting price for your business: The costs of storing wholesale products as well as packing and shipping individual items may be huge especially if you are starting your business and on budget. With drop-shipping, you don't have to store anything nor you have to pack and ship a single product.\nYou don't pay upfront for inventory: You don't pay the drop-shipping company for an order until your customer pays you. You can easily select some products from the drop-shipping company website and test them by listing on eBay without any need to buy them in advance. If your product sells, you will then pay the drop-ship company to ship to your customer. If it does not sell, you have no product in your hand. You just lost eBay insertion fees.\nSaves time: If you buy wholesale, you will spend a lot of time to arrange your products and store them. When something is sold, more time will be invested in printing packing slips and shipping labels, packing your items in shipping boxes as well as shipping your items.With drop-shipping, you will save all that time and you can concentrate on marketing and promoting your items on eBay.\nNo Order Minimums: Excellent drop-shipping companies will not charge a drop-ship fees for small orders.\nLarge variety of products: You can sell on eBay many products from different drop-shipping companies in different categories. You can sell electronics, baby items, clothing, games, etc..It doesn't matter because you will not be storing any of these products. This will not be available when buying wholesale.. You will also able to sell large and fragile items, such as furniture, without the hassle of trying to store, pack and ship each piece.\nEasier listing over eBay: Drop-shipping companies websites are always loaded with professional pictures and descriptions of their products. This will help you to list items easier and faster on eBay.\nBuild your name and reputation: Some drop-shipping companies will ship your packages with labels from your company name [ebay user Id In this case]. Your eBay store name can be put on all the packages drop-shipped to your customers.",
                "Learn about the disadvantages:\n\n\nDrop-shipped products prices are usually a bit higher than wholesale prices: This is a fact, the more you buy, the better price you get.\nSome companies will charge you a drop-shipping fee: You will pay this fee for each product shipped to your customer. This fee is to cover the process of packing and shipping individual items.\nOccasional problems with shipping: some drop-shipping companies are slow in fulfilling your orders or the packaging of products is not that good. This might lead to unsatisfied customer, if he receives his package late or damaged. So whenever you are joining a new drop-shipping company, always do a simple test for them. Make an order for a product for yourself. let the product be shipped to your address. Now you can evaluate by yourself the timing and packaging. You can avoid all this hassle if you know some trustworthy and tested drop-shipping companies to start with.\nDrop-shipping companies serve lot of sellers: Sometimes when you sell an item and you come back to order it, you will find it out of stock. This might carry the risk of unsatisfied customer. If this happens to you, try to handle it with your customer very fast. For example, you can write ”In rare occasions, we are out of stock of some items but the items are not yet removed from our eBay store. If this happens and you have already paid for the item, your money will be refunded in full immediately.”"

            "intro": "Kissing is an art, and with every form of art, it'll take time to develop. Luckily engaging in a passionate kiss is easier than learning the violin! You might feel nervous or uneasy if it's your first kiss, but try to relax and enjoy yourself. Be sure not to rush into a passionate kiss with a boy. Wait until you're both ready and comfortable around each other.",
            "steps": [
                "Relax. You have nothing to prove and nothing to lose. Kissing is a two way street and the guy is probably more nervous than you are. Take deep breaths, but don't make it too obvious that you're trying to calm yourself down.[1]",
                "Match the energy of the person you're with. Passionate kissing can be frenzied, calm and meditative, or anywhere in between. There is an unspoken process where both parties will try to match the type of passion the other is aching for.\n\n\nIt helps to synchronize breathing rates.[2]",
                "Keep a conversation. A good way to begin building sexual tension is to keep him talking. Be in a location that is secluded. Having the option to sit is an extra bonus. Just keep a conversation no matter how mundane it feels. The bleaker the conversation the higher your chances are that he's thinking about kissing you.",
                "Use your eyes. A great way to signal that you're ready to kiss is to go back and forth from looking at his eyes and his lips. This will create tension that is necessary to have a truly passionate kiss. If he repeats and looks at your lips, he is ready for those kissing sparks to fly.",
                "Lean close to him. There are ways of being sly about getting close to him, but you want this move to be obvious. This is another clue for him to know that you want to start kissing.[3]\n\nIt will help if your bodies are slightly touching. Even if your body contact is ever so slight, it will feel exciting.",
                "Touch him. Try and keep the conversation going, and touch him on the thigh or his arm. Another good spot to excite and comfort him is to put your hand behind his neck. Be sure to keep your eyes fixed on his eyes, but take quick glances at his lips.",
                "Move in for the kiss. Tilt your head slightly and move close to his face and pause right before you reach his face. You shouldn't do all the work, but initiating the kiss yourself will excite him. It isn't as popular for the girl to make the first move, but there isn't a rule book to kissing!",
                "Open your mouth. You do not want to open your mouth too wide or else he might feel strange. Just open it big enough to fit his lip securely between yours. Show your tongue ever so slightly. Don't fully extend your tongue at this stage.",
                "Start slow. Start gently kissing your partner on the lips, don't rush. It is good to build the pace naturally. Rushing into the kiss can decrease the potential passion.[4]",
                "Use your fingers. Run your fingers through his hair, his beard, or his shirt, and grab onto them. Pulling him into the heat of the moment is a good way to fire up his passion.[5]",
                "Use your tongue. Again kissing is a two way street. You might want to wait, if this is your first time, for him to initiate french kissing. Gently massage his tongue with yours while his tongue is inside your mouth. When you're ready you can try entering into his mouth. Then gently massage his tongue and the roof of his mouth.[6]\n\nDon't force your tongue into his mouth too quickly. You also don't want to go too deep.",
                "Ease the kissing. After you've been french kissing for a while, try moving your head away momentarily. Look at him and smile. Then either he'll come back in for the kiss, or you can go back for it.",
                "Kiss his neck. This is another way to enhance the passion. Lightly bite and suckle his neck. Do not do this for too long or else he will get a hickey. If you want to show off a hickey on his neck, then go for it. Feel out the vibes from him.",
                "Bite his lip. While your kissing, one way to show your passion is to bite his lip. Don't bite too hard or he might bleed. Only do this if you're confident and think he might like it.",
                "Pick the right time. You don't want to start initiating a kiss in a location that isn't opportune. You're looking for somewhere secluded and where you can hopefully sit.",
                "Go with the flow. Passion can't always be planned out in a step by step process. You need to be flexible and able to easily adapt with the mood of your partner.[7]",
                "Be spontaneous. A boy will be into it if you are spontaneous and confident. If you're going on a walk and see a picturesque trail, then grab his hand and pull him along. Exploring places with someone will increase your security and bond together.",
                "Pick the right guy. This can be the hardest part about passion and kissing. Only go with this guy if he does something for you. Not just buying you material products, but if he excites you or makes you laugh, he may be worthy.",
                "Touch him. Periodically through your date with this guy you should give him slight physical attention. You don't need to overdo this, but every once in a while grab his arm when he says something funny.[8]"

            "intro": "Replacing a toilet is not necessarily a job for a professional plumber. Many DIY type people can take on this project with the right tools and planning. Read the instruction below to find out how to remove your old toilet and correctly install a new one with ease!",
            "steps": [
                "Get rid of all the water. Turn off the water at the supply valve. Flush the toilet to remove most of the water (holding down the flusher for as long as possible). Remove the remaining water from the bowl by forcing it down with a plunger and mopping up the remaining water with a sponge. Then, remove the remaining water in the tank with the sponge as well.",
                "Disconnect the line. Disconnect the supply line using a wrench. You may want to take the opportunity to replace the line. If keeping the line, only disconnect it where it attaches to the toilet.",
                "Remove the bolts. Take the caps (they look a little like domes) off of the bolts at the base of the toilet, then remove those bolts. After that, remove the bolts connecting the tank to the seat.",
                "Remove the tank. Straddling the bowl, place a hand on either side of the base of the tank and lift it off, rocking it side-to-side a little to ease it off and making sure to bend with your knees. Put it somewhere out of the way but be sure to put it somewhere water resistant, as there may be residual water.",
                "Remove the seat. Now you can remove the rest of the toilet. Grab the toilet and rock it side-to-side to break the wax seal underneath and lift it off the bolts. If the bolts are badly rusted and the toilet is getting caught, you may need to cut off as much of the bolts as you can see using a hacksaw. Remove the toilet and put it somewhere out of the way.",
                "Plug the hole. Using an old rag balled up, plug the hole, as you will want to prevent gases from rising into your home and keep tools from disappearing into the floor! Just remember to remove this rag when you put the new toilet in place.",
                "Remove the old bolts. Pull the old bolts out of the flange (you will probably need to pull them to the side a little, as are placed like a nail hanging a picture frame). Dispose of the old bolts in an appropriate manner.",
                "Remove the wax seal. Remove everything that remains of the old wax seal. You can use a putty knife, a rag, and any other tools you need. Wipe it clean when you are done.",
                "Inspect the flange. This is the round plastic or metal circle which was under the wax. Inspect the flange: if it looks damaged it may need to be replaced. You can also buy an adaptor (or super flange) if the original is a bit cracked or damaged.",
                "Replace the bolts. With the flange in good shape, you can now place new bolts into the flange. They should go in the long channels, in much the same way you hang a picture frame.",
                "Place the new wax seal. Place the new toilet on its side on top of a towel or other padded surface. Then place the new wax seal over the hole, with the plastic or rubber facing out. Push it hard into place and turn it slightly like a doorknob to get it to stick in place.",
                "Remove the rag. This is very important! Don’t forget to remove the rag!",
                "Place the toilet. Lift the new toilet and place it so that the anchor bolts go through the holes in the base of the toilet. It will be easier if you remove the new tank first and only put in the base, if the toilet came pre-assembled.",
                "Seal the wax ring. Rock the bowl back and forth a little and press it firmly downwards, either by pressing with your arms and hands or by sitting on the toilet. This will help seal the new wax ring.",
                "Replace the nuts and washers. At the base of the toilet, put in the new washers and nuts. Do not immediately put them on tight though! Place a level across the seat of the toilet and use wood shims underneath the base to make sure the toilet is level. Then, tighten the nuts on each side, alternating between the two sides, tightening just a little at a time to make sure the toilet is kept level. Do not tighten the nuts too much: you don’t want to crack your new toilet!\n\n\nMake sure you’re being careful at this point not to move the toilet too much, as this will cause the seal on the toilet to break.",
                "Place the bolt caps. Place the new caps on the anchor bolts. If they are too high, you can trim them down with a hacksaw.",
                "Insert tank bolts and gasket. Next, take the new tank and place it on its side. Insert the tank bolts and washers from the inside of the tank and then put the tank-to-bowl gasket around the hole at the base.",
                "Place and secure the tank. Take the tank and place it on the main part of the toilet, so that the bolts fit through the appropriate holes. Then add washers and nuts and tighten them, alternating sides as you did with the toilet base. Make sure not to make it too tight.",
                "Install the toilet valve assembly. You may need to install the valve assembly (all the parts inside the tank) if it is not pre-installed. There should be appropriate instructions on the packaging when you purchase the assembly, but you can also ask your local hardware store employee for advice.",
                "Install the toilet seat lid and ring. If they were not already installed, you will need to secure these to the toilet with the appropriate bolts.",
                "Reconnect the supply line. Reconnect the water supply line, using either the new line or the old one if it was in good shape.",
                "Turn the water back on. Try flushing a few times once the water is on to make sure there are no leaks.",
                "Caulk the base of the toilet. Choose an appropriate caulk and thoroughly caulk around the base of the toilet. Once this is dry then you’re done.\n\n\nYou may prefer to omit this last step. If you have a leaking wax seal on your toilet, or if a wax ring seal leak develops later, you will trap water under the base of the toilet. If the sub-floor is wood it will eventually rot it out leading to all sorts of problems when repairs are necessary."

        "How to Dye Hair Bright Red Under Black Hair": {
            "intro": "Deep black hair with vibrant red color underneath is a very popular look. If you want to do a multi-color dye job at home, be prepared to set aside five or six hours to complete the entire process. The black top layer is dyed first, and then the red layer is dyed afterward. Dyeing your hair black is fairly straightforward, even if you’ve never done it before. However, the red layer takes quite a bit more work, since you have to bleach your hair before you add the red dye. Make sure you are well-prepared for this process before you begin.",
            "steps": [
                "Avoid washing your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing it. Your hair may feel a little greasy beforehand, but try to tough it out. The natural oils present in unwashed hair will help to protect your scalp and roots from the hair dye, especially when you get to the red layer.[1] The hair dye will also penetrate your hair better and the results will be more vibrant if your hair isn’t squeaky clean when you color it.\n\n\nIf you must wash your hair before you dye it, use shampoo only and skip the conditioner. Hair dye has a hard time attaching itself to recently conditioned hair.[2]",
                "Use a high quality semi-permanent or permanent black dye. Skip the grocery store aisle and pick up your dyes at a beauty supply store. These dyes are usually salon-grade products and will produce better results. Opt for liquid formulas over mousse formulas for this – liquid black dye will result in a darker and more opaque black than a mousse formula.[3]\n\nIf you’ve never dyed your hair before, use a semi-permanent black dye the first time. If you’re more experienced, feel free to use permanent color.\nIf you are a natural blonde, you may want to dye your hair dark brown first, then black. Sometimes black dye on naturally blonde hair can result in a greenish tinge.",
                "Decide how thick you want the black top layer to be. How much black and how much red you want is a completely personal choice – there is no “right” way to create this look. As a general rule of thumb, you can start by putting your hair in a half-ponytail. Scoop it all up, starting at your ears, and hold it back in the same place you’d put a ponytail.\n\n\nFor a slightly more subtle result, pick up a little more hair after you have it in a half-ponytail.\nMake sure to evaluate the different thickness options before you begin dyeing. It’s best not to make any impulse decisions when you’re in the middle of the process.",
                "Separate the top layer from the bottom with clips. Use a hand mirror or have a friend help you so that everything looks even after you separate the top layer from the bottom. Clip your hair firmly into place to avoiding having to deal with wispy pieces falling down while you’re coloring it.\n\n\nMake sure that you clip back all of the face-framing pieces of your hair. These pieces need to be dyed black so that the red layer will appear to be “underneath” the black layer.[4]",
                "Use tin foil to protect the bottom layer of your hair from black dye. Line a sheet of foil up directly beneath the top layer of your hair. It should hang down over the bottom layer. Make sure the foil extends down at least half the length of your hair. Curl the edges of the foil over the sides of your hair. Clip the foil in place on each side, so the foil will stay in place.[5]\n\nThe foil should be right beneath the top layer, protecting the uppermost part of the bottom layer.\nIf you feel confident that you can apply the black dye without getting it on the bottom layer of your hair, you can skip the foil.",
                "Prepare the dye and your work area. Follow the instructions that came with the dye for mixing and developing it. Wear gloves the entire time and keep a towel secured around your shoulders to protect your skin. To protect the dye from staining your face, apply a thick lotion or a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline before you begin.",
                "Pull a chunk of hair out of the clips and apply the dye. Start in the front of your hair and work with one section of hair at a time. Pull a chunk of your hair out of the clip and apply the black dye to the section, taking care to saturate your hair with the dye from root to tip. Use bobby pins or hair clips to pin the finished sections out of the way so you can easily get to the rest.[6]\n\nYou can twist each completed section into a mini-bun and pin the sections like that, if you like.",
                "Finish applying the black dye to your top layer. Pin the sections up as you finish them so that they are kept away from the bottom layer of your hair. Follow the directions included with the box of dye and leave it on your hair for the recommended length of time. Keep a towel wrapped around your shoulders in case the dye drips onto your skin.\n\n\nAs soon as you finish applying the dye, set a timer for the time span the product recommends.",
                "Rinse out the black dye. Before you rinse the dye out, gather the bottom layer of your hair and secure it in a low ponytail. This will keep it out of the way as you finish with the top section. You will need to lean forward and put your head under the water stream to rinse out the dye. Once you’re leaning forward, remove the clips and bobby pins and start rinsing your hair.\n\n\nDon’t get the bottom layer of your hair wet and keep it out of the way.\nIt may be easier if you have a friend help you with this part.\nRinse your hair until the water runs clear.",
                "Dry your top layer of freshly dyed black hair. Squeeze out the excess water, then put a towel in between the top layer and the bottom layer. Flip your hair over and it will fall on the towel without touching the bottom layer of your hair. Squeeze out as much water as you can and towel dry it gently. Blow dry the top layer of your hair as you normally would.\n\n\nKeep the bottom portion of your hair in the low ponytail throughout this process.\nAfter your black layer is completely dry, clip the hair up again so that you can move on to dyeing the bottom layer.",
                "Prepare the bleach. Most of the bright, unnatural dye colors available are semi-permanent dyes. Unless you have natural light blonde hair, you will need to bleach the bottom layer of your hair before you dye it red for the color to show up. If you apply red semi-permanent dye to your hair without bleaching it first, the color will be nearly undetectable.[7] Consider seeing a professional for bleaching, especially if you’ve never done it before.\n\n\nBleaching is not as easy as dyeing your hair. Far more chemicals are involved and these chemicals can burn your skin and severely damage your hair.",
                "Bleach the bottom layer of your hair. Begin with completely dry hair – never bleach damp or wet hair.[8] Read the directions that came with your bleach product carefully. Follow them exactly. Wear the gloves provided and be extremely careful while you apply the bleach and when you rinse it out. Rinse the bleach out with lukewarm water until the water runs clear.\n\n\nMake sure you are working in a well-ventilated area, since bleach fumes are quite strong.",
                "Towel dry the bottom layer gently. Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to remove any tangles. Let your hair air dry about halfway before moving on to the red dye. You don’t want to apply the red to completely dry hair, but it shouldn’t be soaking wet either.[9]",
                "Dye the bottom layer with red semi-permanent dye. Read and follow the directions for application. Place an old towel around your shoulders before you begin to protect your body. Once you’ve got the red dye on your hair, leave it on for as long as you can.\n\n\nSemi-permanent dye is not damaging to the hair, and the longer you leave it on, the brighter the red will be. Try to leave it on your hair for at least three hours.[10]",
                "Rinse out the red dye with cool water. You should still have your top layer securely clipped on top of your head. Follow the directions that came with the dye for rinsing it out. You may need to rinse it out with your head turned sideways beneath the faucet to avoid wetting the rest of your hair. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.[11]\n\nGently towel dry your hair. Allow it to air dry or take down the top layer and style your hair as you normally would.\nYou may want to avoid sleeping on a light-colored pillowcase for a few days to avoid staining.",
                "Protect your hair color from fading. Vibrant hair dyes fade easily. Do everything you can to preserve your color for as long as possible. Use sulfate-free hair products. Look for shampoos and conditioners that advertise as being “color-protecting.” Wash your hair less frequently and always do so in cold water.[12]\n\nAvoid getting your hair wet in a swimming pool, since chlorine can wreak havoc on vibrant colors.[13]",
                "Use a deep conditioner one to two times per week. Bleach dries hair out and, if you aren’t careful, it can damage it and cause significant breakage. Once you start bleaching your hair, you must take very good care of it to maintain its health. Get a good deep conditioner and apply it one or two times per week.",
                "Use a deep-conditioning mask once per week. Hair masks are similar to deep conditioners because they are highly moisturizing, but they usually include proteins and other ingredients formulated to strengthen your hair. A weekly deep-conditioning mask can help to rehydrate dry hair and restore hair cuticles that have been damaged by the bleaching process.\n\n\nLook for products that contain ingredients like glycerin, vitamin E, shea butter, proteins, Argan oil, keratin, avocado oil, Moroccan oil and coconut oil.[14]",
                "Avoid heat-styling your hair as much as possible. Heat opens the hair cuticle and lifts the color out, so limit your use of blow dryers, flat irons and curling irons. When you are using these tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray on your hair first. It will create a barrier between your hair and the heat.\n\n\nAfter bleaching, your hair is going to be much drier than before. This means it can burn more easily. Use heated tools with care.[15]",
                "Reapply the red semi-permanent dye when the color starts to fade. Vibrant colors will begin to fade within a few weeks, unfortunately. However, to revive the red color, you won’t need to repeat the bleaching process – at least, not for a while. Simply apply the red dye to your faded hair and rinse it out as you did the first time.[16] Depending on how well your hair originally took the red dye, you may need to touch up your color as frequently as every other week.[17]\n\nDo not bleach your hair every time you need to touch up the color. This will severely damage your hair.\nPay attention to the condition of your hair and only repeat the bleaching process when it’s healthy and strong enough to withstand the harsh chemicals."

            "intro": "Over 220 million people speak French,[1] so chances are you will meet one of them some day. If you meet a French person and you haven't a clue what they're saying to you, it helps to let them know quickly that you don't speak their language. You can do this by using some simple phrases, or via non-verbal communication.",
            "steps": [
                "Say \"Je ne parle pas français.\" This means, \"I do not speak French.\"[2] It is pronounced: \"Juh nay pahrl pah frahn-say\" (French speakers often leave out the \"ne\" in a negative sentence. However, in writing always include the \"ne\").\n\n\nIf you speak a little French and want to tell the person that, you can say: \"Je parle juste un peu français.\" This is pronounced: \"Juh pahrle joost un puh frahn-say.\" It translates to, \"I speak just a little bit of French.\"\nSay: \"Je suis désolé.\" This means simply, \"I'm sorry,\" and can be combined with non-verbal gestures to communicate a lack of understanding. This is pronounced: \"juh swee day-zo-lay.\"\nIf you're feeling ambitious (and polite), you can combine this with the previous step, saying \"Je suis désolé, je ne parle pas francais.\" This is pronounced: \"juh swee day-zo-lay, juh nay pahrl pah frahn-say.\" This means, \"I'm sorry, I don't speak French.\"[3]",
                "Say \"Je ne comprend pas.\" This means, \"I do not understand.\" [4] It is pronounced \"Juh nay comprahnd pah.\" This is less preferable to saying \"Je ne parle pas français,\" because the French person might misunderstand what you mean and try to explain what they said by speaking more French! However, if you can't remember \"Je ne parle pas français,\" \"Je ne comprend pas\" is better than nothing.",
                "Ask the other person if they speak your language. If you let the person know what language you do speak, they will know you don't speak French, and you may be able to communicate if the other person in another language. Say \"Parlez-vous...\" (pronounced \"parlay-voo\" This means, \"Do you speak....\"[5] Here are the French words for some other languages:\n\n\nAnglais (pronounced \"ahng-glay\"): English\nEspagnol (pronounced \"esspanyoll\"): Spanish[6]\n\nJaponais (pronounced \"japonay\"): Japanese[7]\n\nAllemand (pronounced \"allaymon\"): German[8]\n\nArabe (pronounced \"ahrahbuh\"): Arabic[9]",
                "Ask for help. If you are in a French speaking country and are lost or otherwise need help, you may need to ask for assistance while communicating that you don't speak French. You can say a couple of things in this situation:\n\n\n\"Pouvez-vous m'aider? Je ne parle pas français.\" means, \"Can you help me? I don't speak French.\" It is pronounced, \"Poo-vay voo meh-day? Juh nay pahrl pah frahn-say.\"[10]\n\n\"Je suis perdu. Je ne parle pas français\" means \"I'm lost. I don't speak French.\" It is pronounced, \"Ju swee pair-doo. Juh nay pahrl pah frahn-say.\"[11]",
                "Shrug your shoulders. If someone tries to speak French to you and you can't remember any of the phrases above, you may need to communicate your inability to undersand non-verbally. Shrugging your shoulders is a near universal gesture for indicating a lack of knowledge or understanding.[12]\n\nShrugging your shoulders can also have a connotation of apology, indicating regret for your inability to understand.",
                "Use your face. In addition to shrugging, you can make a confused face to show a lack of understanding. Asymmetrical facial expressions are often understood as a sign of confusion.[13]\n\nFor example, raising one eyebrow while lowering the other is often interpreted as a sign of confusion.",
                "Gesture with your hands. Turn your palms up while raising your hands from your sides also indicates uncertainty or confusion.[14] Just don't get too enthusiastic with your gestures. You don't want to appear aggressive or be rude."

        "How to Quickly Regain Your Balance": {
            "intro": "We've all been there: You're casually strolling down a hallway or sidewalk when suddenly, for no apparent reason, you forget how to walk and go plummeting toward the ground. Although most falls don't give you much time to think about what to do, there are some things you can quickly do to regain your balance the next time gravity works against you. There are also some exercises that can help you regain some lost stability resulting from aging or an injury or illness that has weakened your balance.[1] Learn how to prevent accidental falls while saving yourself some pain and a bruised ego in the process.",
            "steps": [
                "Plant your airborne foot. Unless you get knocked off your feet by a very strong force, you will likely still have one foot on the ground when you begin to fall. If possible, bring your airborne foot to the ground as quickly as possible. It is much easier to stabilize yourself on two feet than one.\n\n\nThis might not be enough to save you from falling in situations where the ground is slippery (say, an icy sidewalk) or the ground is uneven or sloped.\nYou are better off planting your foot a fair distance (12 inches or more) away from your other foot. A wider stance provides more stability.\nPlant your airborne foot in the direction you are falling. If your center of gravity is moving forward, but you plant your foot behind you, this won't improve your balance. This may not be possible in sideways falls where your airborne foot is on the opposite side as the direction of your fall.",
                "Squat down. Once you have two feet on the ground, bend at the knees and hips to lower your body toward the ground. This will lower your center of gravity, making it easier to stabilize yourself. This also uses your legs as shock absorbers to soften the impact to your joints of stumbling or falling.\n\n\nMake a conscious effort to bend at your waist and lean your torso opposite to the direction you are falling. This will further adjust your center of gravity and stabilize you. Just be sure not to overcompensate, as this could make you fall the other way.\nThis step is most effective on flat ground, where you are most likely to be able to squat down quickly without hurting your knees.\nIf you are a taller person, you may need to squat lower than someone who is shorter, as your center of gravity is naturally higher off the ground.",
                "Use your arms to distribute your weight. Most people instinctively reach out when falling off balance to either grab a nearby object or counter-balance themselves against the direction of the fall. Sticking out your arms away from the direction your body is moving will help quickly offset your shifting center of mass. This way, you are fighting your body's tendency to let its mass be pulled down by gravity.\n\n\nKeep in mind that anything you might be holding onto when you lose your balance could end up going flying when you thrust out your arms. If possible, hold onto it for even greater counter-balancing potential. You'll need all the help you can get!\nThis action is what gives falling people their signature flailing appearance, and you'll probably agree that it doesn't exactly look graceful. Nevertheless, it's better than the alternative.",
                "Grab onto something sturdy. As mentioned above, your natural tendency when falling will be to reach out and catch yourself on something. Go with this. If you can get a hand on something stable enough to support you while you regain your balance, you are much more likely not to fall. You will, however, have to be lucky enough to be within reach of something when you begin to fall.\n\n\nWalls, trees, railings, fences, parked cars, and even other people are good examples of things sturdy enough to catch yourself on. Just be aware that another person might go down with you instead.\nSome things may seem stable enough to hold onto but may tip over once pulled or pushed on with force. This is usually not something you have time to evaluate when falling, but it is worth being aware of.\nThis is another action that could carry the consequence of accidentally throwing or crushing whatever you're holding at the time, as your natural reflex will cause you to rapidly extend your arm while opening your reaching hand.",
                "Adjust to uneven ground. Unfortunately, you will not always be standing on flat, smooth ground when losing your balance. If you are on stairs, boulders, or some other uneven surface when you begin to fall, you will need to adjust your balance-recovery strategy. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n\nPlant your feet on surfaces or objects that are as even with one another as possible. This will keep you from pulling yourself off balance even more while trying to plant your feet. If this is not possible, bend your knees and hips to counteract the different ground heights you're standing on.\nIn some cases, it might be best to transfer your landing into a jog or run instead of a stationary position. This is likely to be a good option if you lose your balance while on unstable ground (like a rocky hillside) or when your body is already moving with some momentum.\nIf you are slowly losing your balance, evaluate whether your landing will be more stable or safer by jumping as you fall. This way you can have a little extra time to reset your center of mass and land on two feet in a more or less vertical position. This is also useful in the event that you are near flat ground but not standing on it when you begin to fall.",
                "Wear appropriate shoes. In some cases, being thrown off balance can be kept from turning into an actual fall by having on footwear suited to your activity. This is especially likely to prevent slips. If you are involved in an activity that puts you at greater risk of losing balance, chances are there is a shoe designed specifically for it that will improve your stability as much as possible.\n\n\nObviously, not all falls occur during risky activities. You should not design your wardrobe or life around the relatively small chance that you could lose your balance at some point. Just be smart about your footwear when the situation calls for it. For example, don't wear sandals while walking on ice.\nChoose footwear that is not likely to actually cause a fall. Many loose-fitting shoes (including flip-flops and most other sandals) could cause you to lose your balance if they come off at an inopportune moment. Again, just don't wear loose shoes while playing sports or doing anything else that elevates your risk of falling.",
                "Look before you leap. A lot of falls occur when the person simply isn't looking where they're going. Minimize your risk by watching your step, especially in slippery or dimly-lit conditions. Being generally aware of your surroundings is good advice anyway, and will also help you more easily recover your balance if you do stumble.\n\n\nWhen walking or moving around at night, use a flashlight or headlamp (if the situation calls for it). Casting light on the ground in front of you will majorly decrease your likelihood of taking a spill.\nWhen walking down stairs, it is an especially good idea to look at the step in front of the one you're currently standing on. If you look at the spot where you intend to step, your brain will do a much better job of telling your foot where to go than if you just settle into a rhythm of bouncing down the steps.",
                "Stay put when impaired. Sometimes people take medications or consume other substances that decrease their ability to maintain balance. If you are under the influence of alcohol or medications that cause instability and reduce reaction times, your best bet for reducing your chance of a fall is to minimize your movement, especially if you are by yourself.\n\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to sit in a padded recliner if you have had a few drinks, but try to avoid walking long distances or participating in activities that involve lots of moving around on two feet.\nUse extra caution when walking down stairs. This can be particularly dangerous if you have impaired balance.",
                "Use handrails. Almost all staircases and other inclined pathways (such as ramps) have handrails along their lengths, often bolted to a wall or other sturdy structure -- and for good reason. Hold onto these when moving down (or up) a steeply inclined path so you have an automatic safety net if you start to lose your balance. Gravity quickly takes over if you fall on stairs; don't let it win!\n\n\nSlide your hand along the railing as you move down the stairway instead of taking it off completely. This minimizes the likelihood that you could fall while repositioning your hand.\nCheck that the railing feels secure. If your railing is not stable or well-attached, it won't do you much good if you use it to catch yourself. If it is not secure, use the one on the other side. If this is not an option, proceed cautiously.",
                "Protect your face. If you do fall all the way to the ground, protect your face and head above all else by covering them with your hands/arms. You should do this even if it means you could sustain an injury to another body part in the process. Head injuries can be very dangerous or fatal, so keep your head off the ground and away from any other hard, immobile objects.\n\n\nWhen falling forward, bring your hands in front of your face. This can serve the dual purpose of helping you catch yourself and protecting your face at the same time.\nWhen falling backward, put your hands behind your head and bend at the waist. This is the best way to keep your head off the ground and cushion the impact if you do make contact.",
                "Consider your limits. In some cases, moving quickly to avoid falling could be almost as likely to cause injury as the fall itself. This is often the case for elderly people or those with pre-existing injuries. If you are likely to throw out your back by contorting to maintain your balance, there's a chance you're better off taking the fall and walking away with some minor scrapes and bruises instead.\n\n\nMuch of your movement while losing balance is a reflex to the situation. As such, you might not be able to avoid a quick body adjustment, even if you are trying to avoid it.\nIf you do have to allow yourself to fall to avoid a potentially more serious injury, try to land in a way that avoids sensitive areas or older injuries. For example, if you have a torn knee ligament that isn't quite healed, you might not want to plant that foot and should avoid hitting the ground with that knee by turning your injured body part away from the ground as you fall.",
                "Use your arms as shock absorbers. If you fall forward to the ground, allow your arms to compress somewhat once your hands or forearms make contact. Think of this as doing a reverse push-up, where you are applying resistance to your arms but allowing them to flex to absorb the impact. This can help prevent arm bone fractures and will generally soften your landing.\n\n\nAny time you catch yourself with your hands or arms during a fall, there is a chance you could break a bone in your arm, hand, or wrist. While this is a risk nobody wants to take, it very well could be your best option to avoid more serious injury.\nYour risk of breaking a bone is higher if you brace your fall at an awkward angle, such as behind you while falling backward. This is because your arms are not suited to hard impacts while extended behind you, and your joints don't easily bend while in that position.\nThe stronger you are in your upper body, the more effective this technique will be in helping you keep from being hurt in a fall.",
                "Roll with it. If you fall to the ground with some momentum (such as if you trip while running or fall off a tall object), you might be able to minimize your risk of injury by letting yourself roll on the ground instead of trying to come to a sudden stop. If you try to do this, just make sure you are protecting your head and neck.\n\n\nContact the ground with your hands first, then your upper back/shoulder blade area. Try not to roll past your feet, as this could cause you to land on your face and defeat the purpose of rolling with your fall!\nWhen rolling forward (or end over end), arch your back and duck your head while bending at the waist. The more you can make yourself into a ball shape, the more easily you'll roll.\nWhen rolling onto your side (or barrel-rolling), keep your arms flexed and tucked in, with your hands over your face and your head ducked slightly forward. This will protect your face while keeping the back of your head off the ground.",
                "Practice weight shifts. To do this, stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly shift your weight from one side to the other, lifting your opposite foot off the ground and holding the position for as long as possible (up to 30 seconds) before switching to the other leg. Repeat this exercise as many times as you feel comfortable.[2]\n\nStand near a stable object or wall if needed so you can grab onto it for stability if you start to fall.\nIncrease your repetitions to boost the difficulty of this exercise as your balance improves.\nChoose a slightly unstable surface to stand on, such as a pillow or a BOSU ball for an even greater challenge.",
                "Do single-leg balancing. To begin this exercise, stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips. While staying upright, raise one foot off the ground and bend your knee so your raised foot is behind you. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds, then switch to the other foot. Repeat this exercise until you've done each foot several times.[3][4]\n\nFor an added challenge, you can try reaching your airborne foot to the side or in front of you without touching it to the ground. This forces your balancing muscles to engage as you shift your center of gravity away from your body.\nStand on an unstable surface or attach weights to your ankles to make this exercise more difficult.",
                "Do single-legged bicep curls. Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and grasping a dumbbell in one hand. Hold the dumbbell so that your elbow is bent at 90 degrees and your palm is facing upward. Lift one leg off the ground and hold that position for up to 30 seconds before repeating on the other side.[5]\n\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by gradually increasing the weight of the dumbbell. You can also try doing full bicep curls instead of keeping your elbow bent at 90 degrees. This will cause your muscles to constantly correct for the shifting weight.\nTry variations to this exercise, such as changing which leg you raise off the ground. It will be harder to lift the leg on the same side as the dumbbell, so work up to this if you can't do it when you first start exercising.",
                "Walk straight lines heel-to-toe. You can work on improving your balance and test how far you've come by practicing walking in a straight line while placing one foot directly in front of the other with the heel of your front foot almost touching the toes of your back foot. Raise your arms to the side and hold them at shoulder height.[6][7]\n\nKeep your eyes focused on a point far in front of you for added stability. Looking at your feet will make it harder to balance.\nIncrease the difficulty of this exercise by moving very slowly or pausing with one foot in the air during each step.\nTurn around at some point along the line you've walked without breaking your posture and go back the other way."

        "wikiHow to Diagnose Vitiligo in Dogs": {
            "intro": "Vitiligo is usually a harmless condition that affects some dogs, often those of certain breeds. It causes parts of your dog's skin, fur, and nose to change color, losing pigment. To diagnose the condition, you first need to look for the symptoms. Then, you should take your dog to the vet for a complete diagnosis.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for changes in the dog's nose color. Often, vitiligo will present in the dog's nose, causing it to go white. If you notice a change in the color of your dog's nose, that could indicate that your dog has vitiligo.[1]\n\nVitiligo is an immune disease that affects the pigmentation, meaning it turns areas of your dog's coat, skin, and nose white instead of their standard color.\nHowever, some dogs do have noses that change colors in winter and summer, particularly as they become middle aged. Either way, talk to your vet to be sure if you notice your dog's nose changing color.",
                "Look for white patches. Another indication your dog has this condition is white patches across its body. While vitiligo often presents in the nose, it can spread throughout the body. Basically, the fur and skin will turn white, rather than its normal color.[2]\n\nOften, the condition will affect the face before the body, particularly around the eyes.[3]",
                "Pay attention as your puppy grows up. Often, this condition will appear as your puppy turns into an adult dog. It may not present at all when your dog is young, so pay attention as your dog grows up, looking for the symptoms in it's fur and face.[4]\n\nThis condition rarely goes away completely, as it is hereditary and usually stays for life. However, you may notice that certain patches return to their normal color, as your dog develops patches in other places.[5]",
                "Look for red and inflamed eyes. Inflammation in the eyes can indicate that your dog has an underlying condition called uveodermatological syndrome. This condition can harm your dog's eyes, so it's especially important to take your dog to the vet if you notice problems with its eyes.[6]",
                "Know which breeds are more susceptible to the condition. Because the condition is hereditary, certain breeds are more likely to have vitiligo. In particular, Afghan hounds, Dachshunds, dobermans, German shepherds, Irish setters, pointers, poodles, and Samoyeds are more likely to have this condition.[7]",
                "Take your dog to the vet. If your suspect your dog has this disease, you should take it to the vet because the color changes could indicate other conditions instead. Your vet will perform a physical examination, as well as do a simple biopsy on your dog to determine if it has the condition.[8]\n\nUsually, all the doctor will do is scrape a bit of skin to be tested. The vet will use the skin to also rule out other causes.\nFor instance, some dogs can have their noses change color if they haven't felt well. Also, sometimes trauma to the nose can cause the problem.",
                "Have the doctor rule out uveodermatological syndrome. While vitiligo is usually from an inherited condition, it can develop from uveodermatological syndrome. With this syndrome, your dog's immune system basically fights against the pigmentation cells. The main issue with this disease is that it can also affect the eyes, leading to blindness.[9]\n\nIf your dog has this condition, you'll usually notice redness and inflammation in the eyes.",
                "Understand it isn't usually a health threat. While the condition changes the look of your dog, it doesn't actually affect the dog's health. Therefore, try not to worry if your vet has diagnosed your dog with this condition. It should still live a long and healthy life.[10]\n\nHowever, if the underlying condition is uveodermatological syndrome, you should get that treated, as it can lead to blindness.[11]",
                "Learn about the treatments. If your dog has basic vitiligo, you usually do not have any options for treatments, though some people have had luck giving their dogs nutritional supplements,[12] such as a vitamin E supplement. Talk to your vet about natural supplements.[13] For uveodermatological syndrome, your dog will need both immunosuppressive drugs and topical eye treatments to deal with the eye problems.[14]"

        "How to Build a Brand": {
            "intro": "Successful branding is the key to outdoing competitors and creating customer loyalty. It requires careful consideration of your mission, creative thinking and a strong desire to connect with the people who will ultimately make your company successful. Start by deciding what's special about your company, what makes your product worth someone's time. From there, develop a logo and slogan that represent your company's unique spirit, and promote your brand with all your might.",
            "steps": [
                "Pinpoint your mission. What qualities, values and experiences are you offering your customers? In order for your branding to seem authentic and be effective, you need to project a truthful image of what your company strives to provide. But before you can do that, it’s important to articulate your company’s mission so that you’re clear on what sets you apart from the pack. Think about the following questions:\n\n\nWhy did you start this business?\nWhat goals do you want to achieve?\nWho are the people you want to help?\nWhat makes your company different from others in your field?",
                "Decide how you want to be seen. Aim for your customers to think of your brand almost like a living, breathing person they can trust. They need to know that your product or service is the one they should turn to when faced with a dozen choices in the grocery aisle or a long list of names in the phone book. Taking your mission into account, decide what type of attitude you want to project. What spin are you going to put on your mission?\n\n\nMaybe you want your product to be seen as the ticket to an adventure or a brand new life or a second chance at youth. This approach is often taken by upscale food companies that sell products like goji berry juice or sprouted grain granola bars.\nMaybe you want to present your brand as smart and cutting edge. Being seen with your product will make customers feel cool, like they’re in a special club. Brands like Urban Outfitters and Apple take this approach.\nAnother approach would be offering your customers a reliable, completely trustworthy option that will never let them down. This is a good approach if you’re selling a product that should never malfunction, like tires, or if you’re building a brand for your law practice.\nYou could also rely on nostalgia to build your brand. People feel connected to things that remind them of childhood and carefree times.",
                "Think like a customer. When you buy a product, why do you buy it? What makes you choose a particular brand? See if you can use your answer to help you figure out how your own brand will come across. Find out what your customers are longing to feel and make your brand help them feel that way. Do they want to feel powerful? Responsible? Conscientious? Smart? Unique? Your brand needs to evoke this feeling with all of its copy, marketing, and design. Cue these feelings not only with language, but with colors and product design as well.",
                "Refine your brand language. Choose a catchphrase or slogan and some key words that you want to be associated with your brand. The words should be closely aligned with your mission statement, and memorable enough for people to repeat to each other and recognize next time they read them. Use your brand language not only in the copy of your products and advertising, but also when you discuss your business and make contacts in person.\n\n\nKeep your text as streamlined and basic as you can, because it will be more memorable that way. A good example of this was the tagline Apple was using for much of the '90's and into the 2000s: \"Think Different\". This worked on multiple levels, because it painted the brand as smart and unique, and the concept was easily slipped into discussions and other branding platforms. Two words: ingeniously effective branding.\nAll copy associated with your brand, including what appears on your product’s label, on your website, and in advertising materials, should match the tone you’re trying to project. For example, your company is meant to be seen as trustworthy and comfortably old-fashioned, use slightly formal language that will make your customers feel that the people who run your business are as dependable as their third grade teacher.",
                "Choose a design scheme. Your brand needs a look that’s in keeping with the tone of your brand mission and language. Are you modern and sleek? Fun and colorful? Traditional and classic? This look should be synchronized across all of your media (brochures, website, product, offices, etc.).\n\n\nDesign a great logo. Your logo will also be used to help embed your brand in your customer's mind. When someone sees a check mark, they think Nike, even if there is no other branding. Your logo must be well designed (so hire a professional) and you should use it frequently and place it prominently.\nChoose the colors that will represent your brand. These colors will be used as often as possible on promotional materials to help evoke your brand. Examples include McDonald's gold and red, Google's red, yellow, green, and blue, or wikiHow's green and white.\nRemember to keep things simple. You want your branding to be easily recognized and quickly remembered. The best way to do this is to be unique but also to be simple.\nYou might want to get legal protection for your visual branding and any distinctive phrases you use to describe your business or your offer.",
                "Involve your employees. Communicate the importance of your brand to your employees and explain why and how you arrived at the brand identity you are promoting. You will need their support for your new branding to be effective.\n\n\nRemember that everything your business does is linked to your brand in the eyes of the customer. This includes the way your employees dress and behave.\nYour employees will have their own idea of what your business stands for and whether it is delivering on its promises, and they’ll provide invaluable insights along the way. Ask your employees how they believe your product is being received on the market, and don’t discount their opinions.",
                "Back up your message with a great product. If your messaging sounds good but you don’t deliver on your promises, your customers will go elsewhere, and your brand won’t catch on. But if your business delivers what your branding promises, you’ll gain your customers’ trust. Before long, they’ll start spreading the word about your quality of service, and your brand’s reputation will soon speak for itself.\n\n\nMake sure that your customers’ association with your brand lines up with what you’re actually offering, too. For example, if you promise that your margarita flavored lemonade is the most refreshing drink on the market, but your customers routinely complain that they took a sip and were surprised it didn’t contain tequila, there’s something off about the way you’re pitching the product. You might want to rename the drink so that customers don’t feel let down when they try your product.\nBeing transparent about your business practices is essential, too. Trust is a really important part of brand recognition, because of your customer's need to feel like they know your brand like an old friend. Let your customers see how you work, where your money goes, and what your real priorities are. Even if the information isn't always the best, it should at least be true and painted in the best possible light.",
                "Conduct market research to find out who you’re serving. What's the age group and demographic of your main customer base? You might be surprised at the answer, so it’s important to conduct some research to find out who’s interested in the product you’re offering, and how they’re responding to your branding.\n\n\nConsider running a focus group so you can test out how your product is received by people from different demographics. Ask them to describe their perception of your product before and after trying it.\nTargeting a specific demographic is often more effective than trying to be universally appealing. You might find that you’ll decide to narrow your focus after learning who’s buying your product. For example, if you find that teenage boys are the most likely group to buy your snack mix, you may want to change your branding strategy to make your product even more appealing to this demographic.",
                "Do a competitive analysis. Conduct research to find out what other companies are offering and decide how your company is different. Your branding should focus on the difference, on what makes your product better than the rest. Finding that special something that sets you apart is essential, because your customers have so many choices that they’ll never even know your product exists unless you help it stand out.\n\n\nYou might find that a certain company has already cornered a particular segment of the market, but that doesn’t mean that your product won’t appeal to a slightly different demographic.\nIf you find that the market is saturated with great products, consider pivoting in a different direction. Either change your branding approach or tweak your product.",
                "Talk with your customers. It’s important to interact with the people who buy your product. Not only will they give you essential feedback on how your business could improve, but it’s a way for them to feel that they know your brand and what it stands for. Represent your brand's values in how you talk and how you act, and constantly give your customers room to give feedback and ask questions so that they get the chance to get to know and eventually trust the brand.\n\n\nRespond promptly to feedback when you receive it. If someone complains, make sure to hear him or her out and resolve the issue to address the person’s concerns.\nAvoid using automatic replies to emails. Try to make your business seem as personable and friendly as you can. Let your customers see your enthusiasm and your excitement about your product.",
                "Develop a marketing strategy. Have a plan in place to get your brand name in as many stores and in front of as many people as possible. Depending on the product or service you’re offering, you might want to consider taking out ads online, in newspapers, in magazines, and wherever you might find new customers.\n\n\nApply your branding, including your visual brand and brand messages, to all of your materials—from packaging, signage and stationery, to your website and marketing materials. Don’t be shy about boldly branding your products and displaying them in as many venues as possible. You want your brand to be everywhere people look.\nAdvertise your brand in unexpected places. Radio advertisements, employee uniforms, and freebies with logos (such as tissues or pens) are all relatively inexpensive ways to promote your brand.\nSee if you can get publicity from a local newspaper, TV station or blog who will review your product or service.",
                "Have a presence on social media. Social media is one of the best ways to build a brand these days. Get basic social media accounts and update them regularly with pictures, deals and other information about your company. Find things that are related and appeal to your customers and give them the chance to interact.\n\n\nFor example, if you're a travel company, post a picture of a beautiful location with a message something like: \"Counting down the weeks to summer vacation and some time to unwind! Where do you want to travel this year?\"\nDo not become spam. Avoid constantly pushing your brand in an annoying way or without context or to people that have no interest. Stay out of your customer's recycle bins. Be real and conversational, not a metaphorical sleazy car salesman.",
                "Have a killer website. This is the age of the Internet and social media, so having a website is central to building a brand. It's fine to base your business in the flesh and traditional media, but if you don't at least have a website, you'll be seen as old fashioned and inaccessible. Hire a professional or use a template and get a nice looking website. This should, at a minimum, discuss what your brand is about, where your offices can be found, what your hours are, and how you can be contacted.\n\n\nUse your site as an opportunity to tell your story proudly. People have an easier time understanding something that fits into a story, and they'll especially identify with things that let them feel like they're a part of that story. Give your customers a story that they can be a part of if you want to build your brand into a big name. Publish it on your website’s “about” page or distribute it in your publicity materials.\nFor example, in the '80's and '90's, Microsoft painted themselves as a company that pulled themselves up by their bootstraps in order to become the most innovative and effective product in their field. This resonated with business-oriented individuals, who wanted to see their own lives in the same way and who could feel apart of that spirit of greatness by buying Microsoft products.",
                "Be involved in the community. Having an in-person presence helps to build trust and spread the word about your brand. Throw events, attend events put on by others, do volunteer work, and be civically active. This is a great way for your customers and potential customers to see what your brand stands for.\n\n\nStreet fairs and other daytime events often provide opportunities for businesses to set up a table and hand out information. Take advantage of this opportunity to forge bonds with people in your community who could potentially be customers.\nGiving back to your community through donations and sponsorships is another good way to get your brand out there. You could sponsor a little league team or a girl scout troop to build up your community presence."

        "How to Become a Physical Therapist Assistant": {
            "intro": "Physical therapist assistants (PTAs) work as part of a dynamic healthcare team. Assistants help physical therapists maintain therapy facilities and monitor patient progress, while also helping patients by assisting them on difficult movements and instructing them on how to use walking aids.[1] The PTA field is one of the fastest growing careers in health care, with even more jobs projected to open up over the next few years.[2] Learn how to take the first steps toward this rewarding and challenging field.",
            "steps": [
                "Take relevant high school courses. If you're considering a career as a physical therapy assistant, it's never too early to start preparing yourself. Taking advanced classes in biology, chemistry, and algebra - and earning high grades - can help you get into a college program that specializes in physical therapy assistance. Some PTA programs require a minimum average in algebra, so studying hard early on can help you go far in this field.[3]",
                "Consider volunteer work. Though it's not a requirement for getting into a PTA program, volunteering at a hospital or other health care facility will look great on a resume, and can help you decide if this career is right for you.[4]",
                "Find an accredited program. The minimum college educational requirement for PTAs is an associate's degree in physical therapist assistant education. It's important to ensure that the program you choose is accredited if you want to pursue a career as a PTA.\n\n\nIn the United States, the only agency that grants accreditation status is the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE).[5] You can find a database of CAPTE-accredited programs on the American Physical Therapy Association's website.\nIn Canada, accreditation is granted by the Physiotherapy Education Accreditation Canada (PEAC), and all physiotherapy programs across Canada are currently accredited by the PEAC.[6]\n\nIf you're unsure of the accrediting board in your place of residence, you can find out by searching online for the PTA accreditation board in your region.",
                "Get an education. There are many programs in PTA offered throughout the world. Accredited programs should mandate that at least 1/4 of a candidate's education be spent in a clinical environment.[7] Other factors to consider while choosing a program include:\n\n\nthe structure and curriculum of a program[8]\n\nthe types of clinical education and training opportunities offered through a program[9]\n\navailable facilities at a program[10]\n\nthe licensure pass rate of students in a program[11]\n\npost-graduate employment statistics[12]\n\ncost of attendance and financial aid options available at a program[13]",
                "Consider an internship. Undertaking an internship while you're studying to become a PTA can drastically improve a candidate's chances of gaining employment after graduation. That's because internships provide interns with hands-on training and experience, and allows the intern to make valuable connections with experts in the field.[14]",
                "Study for the National Physical Therapy Exam. Candidates in the United States who have completed the educational requirements must pass the National Physical Therapy Exam, which is administered by Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT). Candidates may not take the exam more than three times in a 12 month period, and may not take the exam more than six times overall.[15]\n\nStudy guides and practice exams can be found online on the FSBPT website.\nIf you live outside the United States, you can learn about license/certification requirements in your country by searching online for your regional PT board.",
                "Take the National Physical Therapy Exam. The exam consists of 200 questions, broken up into four sections with 50 questions each. Candidates have four hours to complete the exam, and should arrive at least 30 minutes before the exam time.[16]\n\nExams are administered by Prometric at designated testing facilities on fixed dates throughout the year. Candidates can register for the exam and find testing locations and test dates on the FSBPT website, under \"Registration Process\".\nThe exam for PTAs costs $70, payable to Prometric at the time candidates register for the exam.[17]\n\nBring two forms of ID, one of which must be a valid, government-issued photo ID.[18]\n\nEach section of the exam contains both scored and un-scored (pretest) questions. Candidates have no way of knowing which questions are scored and which are un-scored, so candidates should treat each question as though it will be scored.[19]",
                "Pass the exam. Candidates will be issued a score on a scale between 200 and 800. In order to pass the exam, candidates must have earned a score of 600 or higher. Scores are reported to a candidate's jurisdiction roughly five business days after the exam, and scores will be made available for free to all candidates after 10 business days. Scores can be found and downloaded on the FSBPT website, under the \"Status of My Request\" tab.[20]",
                "Learn your state's requirements. In addition to the National Physical Therapy Exam, some states also require candidates to complete and pass an additional state-wide exam and undergo a criminal background check.[21] You can find your state's requirements by going to the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy website and clicking on \"Licensing Authorities Contact Information\".",
                "Learn about continuing education requirements. Some states require PTAs to take continuing education courses in order to maintain licensure. These requirements vary from state to state, and may not be required in jurisdictions outside the US. Contact your state/local board to learn about the licensing requirements in your region.[22]\n\nPTAs can find a list of continuing education courses offered by the American Physical Therapy Association by visiting http://learningcenter.apta.org/Student/Catalogue/Catalogue.aspx.",
                "Know the duties of a PTA. PTAs work in a dynamic field, and the particulars of a PTAs work requirements will vary depending on the PTA's chosen work setting. Some common requirements of PTAs include:\n\n\nworking with physical therapists (PTs) and following a PT's orders[23]\n\nassisting patients with exercises and stretches[24]\n\nlifting or carrying patients as needed[25]\n\nmassaging and/or bathing patients[26]\n\napplying heat/ice packs to patients[27]\n\nmonitoring and recording a patient's progress[28]\n\nreporting all findings and results of patient care to the supervising physical therapist[29]",
                "Choose a work setting. PTAs typically work in a clinical setting, but there are a number of work settings within hospitals, schools, and private PT offices.\n\n\nAcute Care - PTAs work with short-term patients in a hospital setting. PTAs only work with the patient until he or she is capable of being discharged from the hospital.[30]\n\nRehabilitation Hospital - PTAs work with patients for intense therapy lasting three or more hours each day with the goal of helping patients become able to administer self care at home.[31]\n\nSub-Acute Rehabilitation - PTAs work with patients at a special hospital facility with similar goals to those of a rehabilitation hospital, but with less-intense sessions.[32]\n\nExtended Care/Nursing Facility - PTAs work primarily with elderly patients in a facility designed for long-term care.[33]\n\nOutpatient/Private Practice Clinic - patients visit a clinic or facility to work with PTAs, primarily focusing on orthopedic and neuromuscular problems.[34]\n\nSchool - PTAs work with students in an educational environment.[35]\n\nWellness/Prevention/Sports/Fitness - PTAs work with patients with an overall focus on physical wellbeing and injury prevention.[36]\n\nHome Care - PTAs visit patients at the patient's home, residential facility, or even hospital room. Home care PTAs primarily work with patients who are senior citizens and/or patients who have significant disabilities.[37]\n\nHospice - PTAs work with patients who suffer from incurable ailments, with a focus on managing pain and increasing functional abilities for as long as possible.[38]\n\nOccupational Environments - PTAs work to help improve safety and productivity in a work setting and help patients regain the strength to return to work.[39]\n\nGovernment Settings - PTAs work with both civilians and military personnel at local, state, and federal agencies, including the Veteran's Health Administration and the Indian Health Service.[40]\n\nResearch Centers - PTAs may work with physical therapists and other medical professionals on research to increase knowledge of physical therapy and find ways to improve patient care outcomes in all settings.[41]",
                "Build your resume. The most important things on a resume are your education, experience, and qualifications.\n\n\nList your education first, in reverse-chronological order, with your most recent degree at the top.\nConsider listing any relevant coursework that would qualify you for a position.\nList any relevant employment experience in reverse-chronological order.\nSummarize your background and experience (including any internships or volunteer work) under the \"qualifications\" heading.",

Even if there are no openings at the time, they may keep you in mind for future openings.",
                "Make connections. Many PTAs get their first job by making connections during an internship.

        "wikiHow to Sharpen a Swiss Army Knife": {
            "intro": "The Swiss Army Knife is a great tool because it has many different functions. After repeated use, however, the blade of the knife can become dull, which diminishes its effectiveness and can actually make the knife more dangerous to use. Fortunately, sharpening a Swiss Army Knife, or indeed any pocket knife is relatively easy and inexpensive. Follow the steps below to make your Swiss Army Knife blade as good as new.",
            "steps": [
                "Clean the knife thoroughly. Dirt or grease on the blade may result in an uneven sharpening of your knife.\n\n\nSharpening the blade may be easier if you briefly dip the cold blade into boiling water right before you begin sharpening it.[1]",
                "Select a sharpening tool. There are numerous types of files and sharpeners on the market, including Japanese water stones, stones with diamond encrusted surfaces, and stones with different grades of grit.\n\n\nThese different tools will give you slightly different results. For most purposes, a basic, two-sided sharpening stone, available for about $10 at most hardware stores, will be adequate.[2]\n\nThere is also a knife sharpener you can buy specifically for the purpose of sharpening Swiss Army Knives, available from the company's online store.",
                "Lubricate your stone if desired. There is some disagreement as to whether it is important or even beneficial to lubricate your sharpening stone.[3] If you choose to lubricate yours, a variety of different options are available.\n\n\nSome people believe that lubricant should be used because the friction that results from sharpening the blade has the potential to warp it,[4] or because the lubricant will help float away metal particles that can dull the blade during the sharpening process or clog the pores of the stone itself.[5]\n\nOthers believe lubricant is unnecessary, slows the process the down, and may actually dull the blade by washing the metal particles over the blade during the sharpening process.[6]\n\nIf you opt to use a lubricant, you can use cutting oil, mineral oil, kerosene, or WD-40 on natural stones, or water on diamond stones.[7]\n\nBefore applying oil, consult any instructions that came with your sharpening stone. Some types of stones can be ruined by the use of oil.[8]",
                "Lay the blade across the stone. The blade should meet the stone at an angle of 15°-20.° This will result in a cutting angle of 30°-40.°[9]\n\nKeeping the angle consistent throughout the sharpening process is key to a good sharpening. With an official Swiss Army knife, you can approximate the correct angle by resting the back edge of the blade on two stacked pennies.[10]\n\nIf you have a hard time keeping the angle correct and consistent, you can buy a sharpening guide for about $10 that will make the task easier.[11]",
                "Sharpen one side of the blade. Run the knife along the stone as if you were trying to carve a thin piece off the stones surface, repeating this motion several times.[12]\n\nIf your knife is very dull, start this process on the rough side of the whetting stone, or with a diamond stone.[13]\n\nDon't apply too much pressure. Let the stone do the work.[14]\n\nIf using lubricant, add more every few dozen strokes to wash away metal shavings.[15]\n\nIf the knife blade is longer than the stone, you’ll need to sweep the blade sideways as you sharpen so that the entire edge is sharpened completely and evenly.[16]\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you'll want to give the blade six to twelve strokes across the stone.[17]\n\nA more precise way to know when to switch sides is to look for a burr (also sometimes called a \"wire\") that is formed on the other side of the edge. You'll be able to feel burr with your thumb on the side of the edge opposite the stone. The formation of a burr indicates that the steel is thin enough at the very edge that it is folding over slightly.[18] The steel must get very thin to be razor-sharp.",
                "Sharpen the other side. Now, turn the blade over and repeat the process, sharpening the other side of the blade.[19]",
                "Switch to a finer stone. To get a razor-sharp edge, and to remove the burr on the knife, you'll now want to switch to finer grit (i.e. the other side of your whetting stone, if you've got a standard two-sided sharpener).[20]\n\nAt this stage, alternate which side of the blade is making contact with the stone with each stroke.[21]\n\nApply even gentler pressure on these last few strokes to avoid raising another burr.[22]",
                "Dry the blade. Wipe the blade on a towel or clean rag to remove any lubricant and metal fragments from the sharpening process.[23]",
                "Strop the blade. Stropping is running the blade edge across a leather strap that has been covered with an abrasive such as stropping paste or green chromium oxide.[24] It puts a final polish on your knife edge.\n\n\nMove the blade in the opposite direction you did when sharpening. Run it over the leather with the \"spine\" of the blade at the front and the sharp edge behind.[25]\n\nStropping the blade between sharpenings can help keep your blade sharp longer.[26]",
                "Check the sharpness. Once you think you're done sharpening the knife, check to see if the blade is sharp. There are several ways to do this.\n\n\nCut some paper. A razor-sharp blade will easily cut right through.[27]\n\nShine a bright light on the sharpened edge. A dull edge will reflect the light.[28]\n\nDrag the edge lightly across your thumbnail. The blade should scrape the nail cleanly, without catching or vibrating.[29]"

        "wikiHow to Puree Meat": {
            "intro": "Whether you're pureeing meat to make baby food or as part of a soft food diet, the goal is to get a smooth, silky consistency. Pasty or lumpy pureed meat isn't appetizing, even for a baby. The key is to chill your cooked meat and puree it when it's cold. Adding some liquid to the meet will help you achieve a more appetizing texture.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose tender cuts of meat. The more tender the meat you use, the smoother and better-tasting your puree will be. Whether you're pureeing beef, chicken, pork or lamb, you want to choose a tender cut that won't toughen up when cooked.[1]\n\nOften the cheapest cuts of beef are the toughest, so try choosing a cut like top sirloin.\nFor chicken, you can buy the meat boneless or bone-in. If you buy it bone-in, you'll have to be careful to make sure no tiny bones get mixed in with the puree.",
                "Cook the meat slowly. Slow cooking methods help the meat retain flavor and moisture, making it much easier to puree. No matter what type of meat you use, consider cooking it slowly so you end up with the best possible texture. Here are some methods that work well:\n\n\nBraising\nUsing a slow cooker\nBoiling",
                "Make sure it's cooked to the correct temperature. The meat must be completely pre-cooked before you puree it. Check the temperature of the meat when it's done to make sure it has reached the correct internal temperature. Here are the correct temperatures for different types of meat:[2]\n\nChicken: 165 °F (74 °C)\nPork: 160 °F (71 °C)\nBeef: 145 °F (63 °C)\nLamb: 145 °F (63 °C)",
                "Chill the meat thoroughly. After cooking, chill the meat in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The meat should be completely chilled in preparation for processing. Chilled meat will process into much finer pieces than meat that is still warm.",
                "Chop it into 1-inch pieces. Remove it from the refrigerator and chop the meat into chunks that will fit easily in your food processor.",
                "Place a cup of meat in a food processor. If you don't have a food processor, it's fine to use a blender, although the resulting puree may not be as silky-smooth as puree that was made in a food processor.",
                "Blend the meat until it's powdery. \"Powdery\" may seem like a strange word to describe meat, but that's the texture it will take on when you process it cold. Keep processing the meat until the pieces are very fine, almost like sand.[3]",
                "Add liquid and keep blending. In order to process the meat into a smooth puree, you'll need to add some liquid to loosen it up. You'll need 1/4 cup of liquid per 1 cup of meat, regardless of what kind of meat you're pureeing. Choose from among the following liquids:[4]\n\nCooking liquid reserved from cooking the meat\nSodium-free meat broth\nWater",
                "Store the pureed meat in the refrigerator. After the puree has reached your desired consistency, spoon it into a food storage container with a tight-fitting lid. Store the puree in the refrigerator until use. It will keep safely for three to four days.\n\n\nYou can freeze pureed meat for later use if desired. Be sure to store it in a freezer-safe container.\nBefore serving, let the puree come to room temperature or heat it gently in the microwave.",
                "Mix in Puree Vegetables pureed vegetables for a baby. You can make a complete pureed meal for a baby by mixing some pureed vegetables in with the pureed meat. This adds flavor and substance. Try the following combinations:\n\n\nChicken puree mixed with carrot puree\nBeef puree mixed with pea puree\nPork puree mixed with apple puree",
                "Season the meat if it's for an adult. While babies don't need salt and other extra seasonings, an adult might find pureed meat more appetizing if you add some salt and spices. To a cup of any type of pureed meat, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the spices of your choice.",
                "Make chunkier puree. If your baby is getting older and can chew larger chunks of meat, you can make puree with more than one consistency. Instead of pureeing the meat until it's completely smooth, stop when there are still chunks in the puree. As an alternative, add chunks of cooked vegetables to a smooth meat puree."

        "How to Baptize Someone": {
            "intro": "When someone is ready to ask God’s forgiveness for sins and accept Jesus as their Savior, it’s time for them to be baptized. The process for baptizing someone includes making some preparations ahead of time. When you are both in the water, you’ll slowly say the confession of faith in phrases and let the person repeat after you. Then you’ll bless them and lower them into the water. When you raise them back up, it represents Christ rising from the dead and the person gaining a new life.",
            "steps": [
                "Fill the baptistry with warm water ahead of time. You’ll need to fill the baptistry early enough that it has time to fill, which could take 20-30 minutes. At the same time, don’t fill it so early that the water gets cold, unless the baptistry is equipped with a heater. Ignore this part if you are not using a baptistry.[1]\n\nBaptisms can be performed in any standing body of water such as the ocean, a pool, or a river.",
                "Make sure the person wears appropriate clothing. Before you perform the baptism, check over the person’s clothes. Make sure white clothing is thick enough that it won’t become see through. If they are wearing anything loose, make sure it won’t float up and accidentally reveal something. Shorts are better to wear than pants, so they don’t retain as much water.[2]\n\nDark, tight-fitting clothing is often the best. Some churches have robes specifically designated for baptisms.",
                "Tell the person to keep calm and avoid struggling. Since the feeling of falling backwards may cause the person to tense up or fight against you, warn them of this possibility ahead of time. Tell them to relax as much as possible and remember that you will be supporting them.\n\n\nThis is a good time to tell them about how you’ll lower them and then raise them back up. Tell them that you’ll need them to work with you as you raise them up out of the water.",
                "Walk into the water. Get into the water first, and have the person who is being baptized follow you. Most of the time, you will stand facing the audience and the person being baptized will face sideways. Position yourself so your chest is next to their shoulder.\n\n\nIn some situations, the person being baptized may face the audience. You should still stand at their side, so you can properly support them.",
                "Ask them to repeat after you as you say the confession. The confession varies depending on the church and the people involved, but it’s typically a few sentences either way. Break the confession into small phrases, which the person being baptized will repeat after you say them.",
                "Speak slowly and enunciate each word. The person may be nervous if they are in front of a crowd, so it is important that they clearly hear what you want them to say. Speak each word fully so they can understand it.[3]\n\nUse a slow, calm voice to fit the seriousness of the situation.",
                "Say the confession in phrases. When the person is ready to repeat after you, start by saying, “I believe that Jesus is the Christ,” then pause and let them repeat the phrase. Then say, “The son of the living God,” and let them repeat. Continue, “And I accept Him as my Lord and Savior.”[4]\n\nOther versions of this confession ask questions rather than having the person repeat after you.\nExamples of questions to ask are: Do you believe that Jesus is the son of God? Do you believe that He died and was raised to life? Do you accept Him as your Lord and Savior? After each question, the person says, “Yes,” or “I do.”\nTalk to the pastor of your church, or another local church, for other versions of this confession of faith.",
                "Give them the benediction before you immerse them in the water. After they have repeated their confession of faith, say a blessing over them to make their baptism official. Say, “Ellis, I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for the forgiveness of your sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit.”[5]",
                "Tell the person to plug their nose. After the confession has been repeated, encourage the person to plug their nose to avoid getting water in it when they submerge. It is not mandatory that they plug their nose, but most people prefer to.[6]\n\nIf they don’t wish to plug their nose, tell them to cross their arms over their chest.",
                "Place one hand on their back and one on their front. As you get ready to dunk them, place one arm around behind them. Either place your hand on the small of their back, or place your arm around their shoulders. Your other hand will either hold onto the arm they are plugging their nose with or be placed onto their crossed arms.[7]",
                "Guide the person backwards into the water. By it’s earliest definition, to be baptized means to be submerged under water. Gently lower the person backwards into the water until their body is all the way under. If the person is small, their feet may come up off of the ground when they are fully submerged.[8]\n\nIf it is easier for both of you, let the person bend their knees.\nIn some traditions, you dunk the person underwater three times, once each for the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This is up to you, your church, and the person, but make sure they know if you are putting them under three times.",
                "Raise the person up out of the water. You may hold the person under the water for one or two seconds, then lift them up with your lower hand. You’ll need their help, in most cases, so the person should try to stand up as you lift them. If they seem to be stuck in the water, place both of your hands under their arms to lift them up.[9]\n\nTo show them the love of Christ and illustrate their new status as part of God’s family, give the person a hug before you leave the water."

        "wikiHow to Come Up With Ideas": {
            "intro": "Have you ever been stuck thinking of a topic for your new project? Or do you not know what the name of your next chapter in the book should be? Good ideas require hard work, some space to distance yourself from your preconceived notions, and a sounding board to test your ideas against.",
            "steps": [
                "Immerse yourself in the subject. To get your brain on track to come up with an idea, you need to surround it with a lot of relevant information. What this means will depend upon what type of idea you are trying to come up with.\n\n\nIf you are trying to come up with a theory, do a lot of relevant research. You should do studies that problematize your existing ideas. If you have gotten yourself to the point where you have so much information that you think that you know less about the subject than you did before, your brain will struggle to reconcile the facts with your theories even when you feel that you have turned it off.[1]\n\nIf you are working on fiction, read a lot of other authors who are trying to do similar things. Read books that familiarize you with the setting of the place you are writing about. Read literary theory to give you some perspective on how to write. Read philosophy to get ideas you might want to tackle in your fiction.[2]\n\nIf you are an artist, spend some time reviewing the works of other artists in similar fields.",
                "Get to know new and different people. Interacting with people outside of your normal social group will expose you to new ideas and perspectives. This is pivotal to developing “psychological distance,” which is one of the most important prerequisites to creativity.\n\n\nPsychological distance is when you begin to look at things from a perspective other than that which you are accustomed to. Once you begin putting yourself in the shoes of a different person, it is easier to approach your problems in a way you haven’t thought of before.[3]",
                "Go someplace new. Traveling is also a good way to create “psychological distance.” Exposing yourself to new sights and sounds will cause you to think of things from a new perspective. Sometimes you can save yourself a plane ticket and use your imagination to turn the familiar into the unfamiliar.[4]\n\nEven imagining yourself in a new place can make you approach things from a new, more creative perspective.\nSimilarly, people have been shown to be more creative when they imagine the problem they are dealing with to be happening in the distant future.\nAlternatively, practice mindfulness to begin looking at your own world in a new way. Focus on something specific in your environment and try to experience it in its entirety. Notice things that would pass you by in your ever day life.[5]\n\nOne useful example of mindfulness is to pay close attention to crowded social environment. Go on a walk in an urban area or wait around in a crowded park. Look at how people interact with one another. Pay attention to their idiosyncrasies and imagine what is happening in their head. This will put you in another person’s shoes.[6]",
                "Get a pen and write. Allow your ideas to flow freely. You can focus on the topic that you are working on, but allow yourself to venture elsewhere if that is necessary to keep things flowing. Doing journal entries every day can be a good way to get you started writing. Even if the focus is on personal matters, you might wander into your creative work from a new perspective.[7]",
                "Keep a schedule. When no ideas are forthcoming, it can be easy to get discouraged and procrastinate. However, you typically won’t experience an epiphany until you’ve really struggled to work through your problems. Make self-imposed deadlines and force yourself to live up to them. If what you produce by the deadline isn’t spectacular, at least you know what hasn’t worked and how to improve in the future.[8]",
                "Perform structured brainstorming sessions. The demands of a rigorous, structured brainstorming session can force you to create more than you would otherwise. Set a time limit and goals that you aren't sure that you can meet. If you fail, you will still produce more than you would have if you hadn't challenged yourself.\n\n\nFor example, give yourself 30 minutes to come up with 30 ideas. Just write as quickly as possible.\nGive yourself 30 minutes to write two pages of material.\nAlternatively, give yourself an hour to sketch out a drawing.\nIt's unlikely that you'll come out with a great final product, but this sort of challenge can force you to come up with new ideas.[9]",
                "Learn what to forget. The better part of the creative process will always be excluding the things that don’t matter. Knowing what doesn’t matter at the beginning can be difficult, but you should start writing down some ideas, even if they don’t seem well founded at first. Begin structuring the important information in your head and weed out what doesn’t seem to fit.[10]",
                "Create the right conditions for epiphanies to occur. Epiphanies are rare and difficult to control, but they are often the most important and impactful ideas that we produce. Epiphanies are produced by our unconscious mind, struggling with ideas that have dominated our conscious mind. To have an epiphany, therefore, we need both to work strenuously with ideas, but also take time off periodically to let them percolate.[11]\n\nThat doesn't mean that you should take off all the time. Try to give yourself at least an hour a day to let your mind wander naturally. Take at least a day off every week for the same purpose.",
                "Make yourself happy. We can get angry and frustrated when struggling to figure something out. Those feelings will interrupt our creative process. We need to take some time off to be happy. How we do that will vary with our individual tastes.[12]\n\nTry shopping. Check out some of the sights and sounds while you are out of the house.\nSurfing the web is a way to distract yourself that also exposes you to new ideas and information.[13]",
                "Enjoy nature. Go outside in your backyard and look at the sky. Go on a hike. Clear your mind. Try to focus on nature rather than the problems that you have been grappling with. Let your mind wander naturally and you might find what you are looking for.[14]",
                "Listen to some music. Put on some music to relax and clear your mind. Try to put on new music that will get you out of your intellectual rut.[15] Alternatively, put on some music that will provoke powerful emotions that can inspire you.[16]",
                "Meditate. Meditation is the classic way to clear your mind. Once you’ve cleared your mind, some of the mental blocks and preconceived notions that are hindering your creativity will collapse.[17]\n\nClose your eyes and focus on one thing. It can be a phrase that you repeat in your head or a picture that you imagine in your mind’s eye. If your mind begins to stray elsewhere, gently pull it back to what you were meditating on.\nMindful meditation has been shown to increase creativity by allowing the conscious part of your mind to take precedent over the reactive, habitual reptilian brain.[18][19] To perform mindful meditation, sit upright in cross-legged pose, with few distractions. Devote about 25% of your attention to controlling and observing your breathing. Keep your eyes open and pay close attention to everything in your surroundings. When your mind begins to wander, focus it back on your environment.[20]",
                "Put your idea on paper. Once something has popped into your head, it is important to see if it works. Start mapping it out on paper, drawing it, or writing it down. Be sure that you have some record of what you have come up with so that you don’t forget it.[21]\n\nConsider keeping a notebook on hand so that you can write down your ideas before they slip away.",
                "Research your idea. An idea might seem good at first, but be unfounded. If it is an empirical theory, test it against the evidence to determine whether it is valid. If it is a literary or artistic idea, go back to the work of other artists to determine how original it is. See if your understanding of the setting or the facts of the plot are realistic.[22]",
                "See what the critics say. You should constantly seek feedback to improve your work. If you can get professional feedback that is great, but, if that is not feasible, start with your social circle. Throw your ideas out to your friends or significant other. Just because an idea sounds good to us doesn’t mean that it will fly with other people.[23]"

        "wikiHow to Get Rid of a Gum Boil": {
            "intro": "Boils that form on your gums are often very painful, and can cause difficulties eating, drinking, and speaking comfortably. They can come up without warning and are often stubborn, but there are ways to help get rid of one and treat the site afterwards to prevent it from returning.",
            "steps": [
                "Get the boil surgically removed. If you have chronic gum boils, or gum boils that are cosmetically embarrassing, you may want to consider getting them surgically removed. This can greatly increase the chance of the boil not returning again. You’ll need to speak with a gum specialist, such as a periodontist, about this option to see what they recommend.[1]\n\nYour dentist or gum specialist may recommend simply draining the boil instead of surgically removing it, depending on the location of the boil and how complicated it would be to remove it. In this case they will give you antibiotics to take for at least five days after draining.",
                "Look into periodontal therapy. Many gum boils are caused by active gum disease or some other kind of periodontal disease that leads to periodontal abscesses. If this is the case for you, it may be important to get a deep cleaning from your dentist in order to remove any active bacteria from the inside of your mouth that could be contributing to the gum boil.[2]\n\nIf this seems to help, you’ll want to be sure to continue with regular visits for cleanings to help keep your oral bacteria levels down and to maintain your overall oral health.\nConsider gum surgery if your periodontist decides it is the best way to prevent future infections or gum boils",
                "Consider root canal therapy. Some gum boils are caused by dental abscesses. In these cases, root canal therapy would be required to remove the bacteria and decayed enamel from the area. Once the root canal is performed, a crown or filling is inserted and sealed to protect the tooth and the mouth from further infection.[3]\n\nRoot canals can be quite expensive and require multiple visits to perform, so make sure you look into the cost before you agree to the surgery.",
                "Use a salt mouthwash. This will help reduce swelling and dry up or draw out any infection that might be present in the gum boil. Fill half a tumbler or glass with lukewarm water and add half a teaspoon of standard table salt. Mix until the salt is dissolved. It doesn't matter if some remains in the bottom of the glass. Use the saltwater as you would your usual mouthwash, but be careful to keep a special emphasis on the infected site when you're rinsing. Do not swallow the saltwater.[4]\n\nContinue washing with the salt washes once or twice a day for a week to help heal the boil. This will reduce chances of it coming back. At the same time, be sure to maintain a good dental hygiene routine.\nThis method is recommended by oral health professionals and is clinically proven to be effective, but is not a replacement for a visit to your dentist.",
                "Apply essential oils. Applying essential oils topically to a gum boil can help reduce the levels of bacteria present and improve the overall tissue health. Combined, these factors can lead to the dissipation of a gum boil without needing to seek professional help. Simply add a few drops of the essential oil to a glass of water and rinse your mouth thoroughly.[5]\n\nSome good essential oils to choose are spearmint or peppermint oils.\nBe sure not to swallow the essential oil mixture.\nRemember that this is a recommended home remedy and has not been proven effective with scientific evidence.",
                "Eat raw onions. Consuming raw onions can be a very effective home remedy for treating gum boils. Onions contain relatively high levels of sulfur, which can help heat up and dry up existing boils in your mouth.[6]\n\nThis is a home remedy and may be less effective than other solutions that have been verified by medical professionals.\nIf you don’t like the taste of raw onions, try eating them on other things — like in salads or on sandwiches where the flavor is masked.\nDon’t cook the onions as this can reduce the amount of sulfur present in the vegetable.",
                "Brush daily. Brushing your teeth regularly (at least twice a day) is probably the single most important thing you can do to prevent gum boils and to contribute positively to your general oral health. Brushing helps reduce bacteria and germs that are present in your mouth, as well as removing plaque and food particles.[7]\n\nUse a toothbrush with soft bristles and talk your dentist about proper brushing technique.",
                "Floss your teeth daily. Flossing is one of the best ways to help reduce plaque and bacteria buildup in your mouth. Since overall oral health is crucial for preventing gum boils, it is very important to floss regularly — especially if you have trouble with chronic or recurring gum boils.[8]\n\nMost dentists recommend that you floss twice daily.",
                "Use an antibacterial mouth rinse. Since bacterial buildup is one of the main causes of gum boils, it is important to do everything possible to minimize the amount of bad bacteria in your mouth. A good way to do this is to incorporate an antibacterial mouth rinse into your daily oral care regimen. Use it after flossing and before going to bed.\n\n\nWhen choosing your mouthwash, the brand doesn’t really matter. Just make sure that the packaging indicates the product is antibacterial and look for the American Dental Association seal to ensure you’re purchasing a quality product.[9]",
                "Visit the dentist regularly. The best way to prevent gum boils is to maintain proper and consistent oral care. This includes regular visits to the dentist for cleanings and checkups. Your dentist or dental hygienist can help remove any plaque buildup and they can also let you know if they see any problems or recommend any specific courses of action.[10]\n\nYour dentist can also probably spot signs of tooth decay or other periodontal problems much earlier than you can, so this will help you spot symptoms or causes of gum boils early on.\nRegular dental visits should occur twice a year (once every six months)."

        "wikiHow to Start a Story": {
            "intro": "Whether you’re writing a short story or a novel, coming up with the perfect opening can feel like the hardest part. But, while this can seem daunting, it is by no means impossible! Start with a good idea or generate one if you’re not sure what you want to write about. Outline your plot and characters to narrow your focus, and then start writing!",
            "steps": [
                "Ask “What if” questions to jumpstart your imagination. When you ask yourself a “What if” question, you’re telling your brain to take something ordinary and think of it in a new way. After you ask a “What if” question, think through some possible answers. Keep in mind that every “What if” question can have various anwers. Keep answering your “What if” question until one of your answers ignites your imagination and feels like it could lead to a larger story. Examples of “What if” questions include:[1]\n\nWhat if dinosaurs still existed?\nWhat if we only had a limited amount of luck per day?\nWhat if our hair changed color every day?\nWhat if my best friend was a spy?",
                "Ask “I wonder” questions to craft a realistic fiction story. “I wonder” questions are a way to probe deeper into the reasons for why something happens, who it might happen to, and how it might feel. It doesn’t matter if you ask an expansive question or a very specific one, asking and answering an “I wonder” question opens your mind up to the possibility of learning new things and seeing old things in a new light. Some examples of “I wonder” questions are:[2]\n\nI wonder what Jim does in his basement every night.\nI wonder what it’s like to be a cross-country truck driver.\nI wonder what life is like in rural Russia.",
                "Eavesdrop on other peoples’ conversations. Listen to other people in crowded places (like coffee shops) and discretely write down what they’re saying. Use that dialogue as a starting point to create characters and situational plot. What are their lives like? What’s their relationship to one another? Once you have a general idea of these characters, create a plot that focuses on their lives, or use them as minor characters in a larger storyline.[3]\n\nIf you think you’re making anyone uncomfortable, stop eavesdropping and try another conversation.",
                "Keep a journal for stray ideas. Not all of your ideas can form a full story, but they can always help to create new characters or subplots. Try to avoid erasing “bad” ideas - instead, move them to a different list or journal that catalogues your half-formed ideas, and return to them later.\n\n\nWrite your dreams down, too. Dreams and daydreams can be great starting points for a good story![4]",
                "Read as much as you can. Reading can help you get a sense for how a story flows, and will encourage you to develop your preferences. Do you like stories that begin and end abruptly? Do you value smooth setting description and characterization? Is plot the most important element of a story for you? Pay attention to how stories start, how they introduce their characters, and how quickly or slowly the plot moves, so you can start brainstorming your own narrative.[5]\n\nMost literary genres and types have specific conventions, so make sure you reading books and stories that are written in the style you plan on writing in.",
                "Use a plot generator. Plot generators can help kickstart a story by providing strange, creative, or new suggestions. Sometimes, the extra boost from an outside source is all you need to get that spark of creativity!\n\n\nFor general plots, try http://writingexercises.co.uk/plotgenerator.php\n\nFor fairytale plots, try http://www.springhole.net/writing_roleplaying_randomators/fairytaleplot.htm\n\nFor mystery/horror plots, try http://tzplotgenerator.com",
                "Create a plot outline. Your outline should include a general sense of what will happen, where it will happen, and who it will happen to. You can be as detailed or sparse as you’d like. Write at least one sentence per scene or chapter, depending on how long your work is, but don’t worry about filling in every little detail. That’ll come later![6]\n\nWrite the whole plot, not just the beginning, so you know where your story is going.\nOutlines don’t work for everyone. If trying to plan out your story before you start bogs you down, just dive right in and figure out the details as you go along.",
                "Create a character profile for each major character. You can also make less detailed character profiles for your minor characters, if you’d like. While some of the information from your character profiles might never make it into your story, knowing these facts helps you write more well-rounded characters and therefore makes the story more interesting for your readers! You can find various character profiles and character profile worksheets online, but some basic things to write in your character profile include:[7]\n\nHeight, weight, race, eye color, hair color, skin color, health\nMannerisms, habits, hobbies, speech patterns, whether they’re an extrovert or introvert\nGreatest flaw, best quality\nEducation, intelligence, short- and long-term goals\nThe most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to them\nThe thing they’re proudest of\nStrengths, weaknesses\nTheir relationship to the other characters",
                "Establish your setting. Your story’s setting can shape what your characters do, what their pasts are like, and what their future opportunities might be. For example, a story set in rural Brazil will be extremely different from a story set in outer space, because these environments influence what the characters can and can’t do. Think about how your setting impacts your characters and whether the setting changes throughout the novel. Some important things to consider include:[8]\n\nThe year the story is set in\nThe climate and time of year\nNearby bodies of water, mountains, plants, and other geographical factors\nThe cultural and political environment of the location you’ve chosen\n\nFor example, a story set in Washington D.C. will probably include a mention of politics\nA story set in Paris might choose to mention fashion or nearby monuments like the Eiffel Tower",
                "Choose your point of view. There are three types of point of view: first person (“I” pronouns), second person (“You” pronouns), and third person (“He,” “She,” and “They” pronouns). The type of point of view you choose will mold your story.[9]\n\nAre you telling the story from the protagonist’s eyes? If so, your story should be told in first person or in third person limited (“He,” “She,” and “They” pronouns that still express the protagonist’s thoughts).\nAre you telling a story with a narrator? In this case, you’d probably use third person and either tell every character’s thoughts or no character’s thoughts.\nSecond person a less common point of view, as it can be disorienting and confusing for the reader. Before choosing to write a second person story, read a book or short story that uses that point of view.",
                "Find your starting point. You don’t want to start too far back or jump too far forward in the story. Remember that you’re introducing the reader to a new world (even in realistic fiction) so make sure you give them a chance to learn the basics - the main character’s name, their personality, their driving force - in the first scene or chapter.[10]",
                "Try different beginnings. If you’re not sure how to start, play around with different starting points. You might have to try a few before you find one that clicks, but that’s what writing is all about!\n\n\nTry starting with a character in action or your character’s physical appearance to immediately show the reader who’s important.\nStart with a bird’s eye view of the setting. Describe sensory detail before zooming into your character’s life or home.\nTell your readers a character’s “secret” to immediately hook them.\nSet up the central conflict at the very start to make the reader desperate to know what’s going to happen next.\nBegin with a memorable, dramatic, or important flashback. Be careful, as flashbacks can confuse the reader if they don’t know it’s a flashback.",
                "Craft an intriguing opening line. Think about what kind of opening line you want to write. Will it be absurd and amusing? Bleak and foreboding? Inviting? Unexpected? Will it present an expansive truth? The type of opening line you choose sets the reader’s expectations for the story to come and convinces the reader to read the next line. If you’re feeling stuck, look up examples of famous opening lines for inspiration:[11]\n\nAbsurd and amusing: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” From Nineteen Eighty-four by George Orwell.\nForeboding: “It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” From The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath.\nInviting: “Call me Ishmael.” From Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.\nUnexpected: “All children, except one, grow up.” From Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie.\nExpansive truth: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" From Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy.",
                "Write a prologue if your story has a lot of historical or narrative context. If the story’s context involved the main character, you can include this information in the main narrative. But, if the necessary context happened in a different setting, or if didn’t involve your protagonist in a concrete way, your book might benefit from a prologue.[12]\n\nMake sure your prologue is necessary and impacts the story’s plot significantly -- if it doesn’t, your story might be better of without one.",
                "Avoid information dumping. You don’t have to tell your readers everything about the story in the first scene or chapter. Information dumping can bog the story down and deter your readers, just as surely as a lack of information can make them confused. Work on striking the right balance, and ask outside observers for advice if necessary.",
                "Reflect on what you’ve written. After writing your beginning, think about the story as a whole and decide if the opening fits. If it doesn’t, you can either change your opening or revise your story.\n\n\nIf you’re not sure if your opening is working, ask for an outside opinion! Tell your reader that you’d like some honest but positive feedback on what you have so far.",
                "Write for at least 45 minutes at a time. Writing for longer chunks helps you get into the flow of the story, especially when you’re starting out. While it can be tempting to get five or ten minutes of writing in here or there, this might create a disjointed story, or cut up your story’s “voice.”[13]\n\nChoose a writing location that works for you. Try writing at home, in a coffee shop, in a library, in a park, or somewhere else. Decide if gentle conversation, silence, or music helps you be most creative.[14]",
                "Have fun! Writing can be difficult, frustrating, and challenging, but at the end of the day it should also be fun! Enjoy your stories, focus on ideas you like, and write stuff you’ll want to read later on.[15]"

After baking your brownies, cut them into small squares, chill them, and dip them into chocolate. You can then decorate them with sprinkles, nuts, glitter confectioners sugar, or any other ingredients you want.",
            "steps": [
                "Melt the butter and chocolate. You should melt the butter and chocolate in a pot over the stove. Use a heavy sauce pan and melt the butter and chocolate over medium-high heat. Watch the pot closely to make sure nothing burns.[1]\n\nIt's a good idea to remove the butter while it's still somewhat solid. Butter can burn easily. If the chocolate is melted and there is still a small chunk of butter that is solid, remove the pan from the heat. Mix everything together until the butter melts as well.\nAfter melting, allow your butter and chocolate mixture to cool off until it reaches room temperature. This should take about 15 minutes.[2]",
                "Stir in the sugar. Once the butter and chocolate mixture is cool, add your sugar. Use a mixing spoon to stir in the sugar. Keep stirring until you have an even mixture.[3]",
                "Whisk in the eggs and vanilla. Start with the eggs, adding them one at a time. Use a wire whisk to gently whisk each egg into the batter until the mixture is smooth and even. Once the eggs are added, whisk in the vanilla.[4]",
                "Fold in the flour and salt. To fold in the ingredients, add the flour and salt to the top of the butter mixture. From there, use a rubber spatula. Starting at the back of the bowl, cut a vertical line through the ingredients across the bottom of the bowl.[5]\n\nRotate the bowl a quarter of a circle and cut another vertical line using your spatula. Continue this pattern. Eventually, the ingredients should all mix together evenly.",
                "Prepare your baking pan. Take an 11 by 7 inch baking pan (approximately 28 by 18 centimeters). Spray with a non-stick baking spray. Then, pour your brownie batter into the pan using a spatula or spoon.[6]",
                "Bake your brownies. Brownies should be baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about 178 degrees Celsius). The brownies should bake for about 35 minutes.[7]\n\nCheck to make sure your brownies are done before removing them from the oven. To do this, stick a toothpick in the center of the brownies. It should come out clean. If there is batter on it, bake the brownies for a few more minutes.",
                "Allow your brownies to cool. After removing them from the oven, set the brownies aside for an hour or so. You want them to cool completely before proceeding.",
                "Cut your brownies. There is no precise size to cut your brownie bites. It depends on personal preference. Use a knife to cut the brownies into bite-sized portions. You can do this by cutting vertical lines through the brownies, followed by horizontal lines.[8]\n\nFor the cleanest cuts, use a cold knife. You can put a butter knife in the refrigerator for an hour, for example, and then use it to cut the brownies.",
                "Chill your brownie bites. Set your brownie bits in a refrigerator. You should let them chill for at least an hour. This way, they will be solid enough to dip in your chocolate mixture.[9]\n\nAs the brownie bits will not be in the fridge for long, it's okay to put them in uncovered. However, you can put aluminum or plastic covering over the brownie bits if you want.",
                "Melt your chocolate. Place your chocolate squares in a microwave safe bowl. Place them in a microwave for 30 seconds. Then remove them and stir. Keep microwaving the chocolate in 30 second intervals until it's completely melted.[10]",
                "Dip your brownies in the chocolate. Remove the brownie bites from the refrigerator. Dip them into your chocolate mixture one at a time.[11]",
                "Decorate the brownie bites. You can decorate the brownies as desired after dipping them in the chocolate. You can add decorative sprinkles or sparkling sugar, for example.[12]\n\nIf there is a special occasion, decorate the brownie bites to reflect this. For example, you can use red and green sprinkles for Christmas or pink sprinkles for Valentine's Day.\nIf you're making the brownie bites for a friend, use decorations they would like. If you're making them for a child's birthday party, for example, glittery sugar may be appropriate.",
                "Chill your brownie bites. After the brownie bites have been dipped in chocolate and decorated, place them in refrigerator again. Chill them until the chocolate hardens. How long this will take depends on the precise coolness of your refrigerator, but it generally takes around 20 minutes.[13]",
                "Store your brownie bites. You should store your brownie bites at room temperature in an airtight container. They should keep for about 3 to 4 days. After this point, you should discard your brownie bites.[14]"

        "wikiHow to Diagnose Lumps in Guinea Pigs": {
            "intro": "Does your guinea pig have a lump on its body? If so, that lump could be one of a few things: an abscess (a large pocket of pus), a lipoma (tumor full of fat cells), a skin tumor, or a cyst (fluid-filled lump).[1] It probably won’t be hard for you to see the lump, but only your vet will be able to determine what caused the lump to appear. When you notice a strange lump on your guinea pig, take your guinea pig to your vet for a diagnosis.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for abscesses on the head and neck. Abscesses under the skin are very common in guinea pigs. They are the body’s attempt to ‘wall off’ an infection and keep it from spreading. Abscesses can form either after a bite from another guinea pig, or if something rough and sharp (e.g., straw) goes through the skin.[2] They can form anywhere on a guinea pig’s body, but the most common locations are the head and neck.[3]\n\nAn abscess in the neck could be a swelling of the lymph node in that area.[4] Lymph nodes are small glands that help the body fight infection.\nAn abscess can feel firm or soft.[5]",
                "Identify abscesses in your guinea pig’s mouth and jaw. Abscesses can also form in the mouth or jaw of a guinea pig. Abscesses in these areas can become large very quickly.[6] Your guinea pig may look fine on one day, then have a large abscess the next day.\n\n\nWhen you handle your guinea pig, gently open its mouth to see the abscess. If the abscess is in the jaw, you will see a large bump along your guinea pig’s jawline.",
                "Examine your guinea pig’s back for cysts. Guinea pigs can get several types of cysts, with the most common being a sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts contain oil from the skin glands that produce oil (sebaceous glands). Sebaceous cysts are typically located on a guinea pig’s back and near the rump, but can form in other places as well. Although they can become very large, cysts are usually about the size of a pea.[7]\n\nCysts become a problem if they become large.",
                "Check for tumors on the tail and chest. Tumors can also form lumps. For example, a lump on your guinea pig’s tail could indicate a skin tumor called trichofolliculoma.[8] A lump on the chest could indicate another type of cancer called lymphosarcoma.[9]\n\nA female guinea pig can develop a mammary tumor, which you would see as a lump on the belly.[10]\n\nLipomas are tumors made up of fat cells. There are no specific places where you would look for a lipoma on your guinea pig. Your guinea pig may have several lipomas at one time.[11]",
                "Detect a decreased appetite. Sometimes, a lump can make a guinea pig feel so bad that it doesn’t want to eat. For example, if your guinea pig is not eating its meals and doesn’t want any tasty treats, check its mouth for an abscess.[12] Even if your guinea pig wants to eat, the size of the abscess in its mouth or jaw could make it difficult to chew food.\n\n\nSometimes, a guinea pig will stop eating right before an abscess ruptures (an abscess can sometimes rupture on its own).[13]",
                "Smell your guinea pig’s breath. When you hold your guinea pig, take a quick sniff of its breath. If your guinea pig has a mouth abscess, its breath will probably smell quite unpleasant. The unpleasant smell would be due to infection. Along with bad breath, you may also notice drooling.[14]",
                "Observe changes in behavior. An abscess can be very uncomfortable for a guinea pig. If your guinea pig squeals with pain when you pick it up, seems really tired, or doesn’t want to play with you, it could have an abscess. You may also notice your guinea pig heavily grooming the area of the abscess.[15]",
                "Take your guinea pig to your vet. If you see a lump on your guinea pig’s body, schedule an appointment with your vet. Your vet will perform different tests to determine the cause of the lump. Do not delay in taking your guinea pig to your vet—if the lump is an abscess, it could make your guinea pig very sick by overwhelming your guinea pig’s natural defenses against bad bacteria.[16]",
                "Explain your guinea pig’s history. During your appointment, give your vet as much information as you can about your guinea pig. For example, talk about your guinea pig’s overall health and when you first noticed the lump.[17] In addition, provide information about your guinea pig’s diet, living environment, and if it has cagemates.\n\n\nYour vet will use the information you provide to come up with a diagnosis. Therefore, the more information you provide, the better.",
                "Allow your vet to examine your guinea pig. A physical examination will give your vet important clues about what caused the lump to form.[18] Your vet will weigh your guinea pig, look it over from head to toe, and listen to its heart and lungs. Your vet will pay special attention to the area of the lump.",
                "Allow your vet to perform additional testing. Your vet may want to run some extra tests to confirm the diagnosis of the lump. One type of test is called fine needle aspiration (FNA), during which your vet will use a small needle to withdraw a fluid sample from the lump. Your vet will look at this fluid under the microscope to detect different cell types (e.g., fat cells, white blood cells). Another type of test is a biopsy, which would help your vet diagnose a tumor.[19]\n\nYour vet would need to sedate or anesthetize your guinea for FNA or a biopsy.\nA fluid sample from the lump can be useful for identifying bacteria. The test to identify bacteria is called a ‘culture.’[20]"

        "How to Treat Dry Facial Skin": {
            "intro": "If you have dry skin on your face, chances are you feel like you’ve already tried everything. Even after slathering your face with all manner of lotions, creams and oils designed for extra-dry skin, it still looks dry and flaky. Treating dry facial skin is a multi-step process that involves changing the way you wash, exfoliate, moisturize and care for your skin every day. Following a dry skin-friendly routine will clear up your dry skin and help it look bright, healthy and vibrant once more.",
            "steps": [
                "Try washing with water only. One of the biggest skin care mistakes you can make is washing your face with harsh cleansers. If your skin is dry, it’s under-producing oils that protect your skin from flaking off. Harsh cleansers wash away the oils you do produce, making the problem worse. Instead of washing with soap of any kind, try washing with just plain water, especially when you’re not wearing makeup.\n\n\nWarm, not hot water should be used, since hot water can be drying. Wet a washcloth with warm water and gently run it over your face. Then pat your face dry with a clean soft towel.\nEven cleansers that are labeled as having moisturizing properties probably contain ingredients that are drying. Look at the label and read the ingredients: if you see sulfates, any type of alcohol, or salicylic acid, don’t use it on your face.",
                "Consider the oil cleansing method. This is the best method for washing your face at night when plain water isn’t going to cut it. The oil cleansing method removes makeup, dirt, sweat, and everything else without drying out your skin. It might sound counterintuitive to use oil to clean your skin, but adding oil actually attracts the oils that are there, acting as a gentle cleanser. You can tell your friends with acne to try it, too, since this method is healing for all skin types.\n\n\nStart by making an oil blend that suits your skin type. For very dry skin, jojoba oil, argan oil and almond oil are all quite effective and nondrying. If you have oily spots, too, add some castor oil to your blend.\nSplash some warm water on your face, then use your fingers to rub the oil blend all over. This is an effective way to remove eye makeup, too, even the waterproof kind.\nUse a washcloth wet with warm water to gently remove the oil. Wipe it off using a circular motion, rinsing it out every so often. Continue until all the oil is gone.\nRepeat if you still have makeup on your face.\nRinse your face with warm water and pat dry with a soft towel.",
                "Exfoliate your face a few times a week. Dry skin is actually a layer of dead skin cells that build up and begin to slough off. Removing this layer of dead, dry skin a few times a week reveals the fresh, healthy skin underneath. Try one of the following methods for exfoliating your skin:\n\n\nUse a scrub. You can make a scrub by mixing a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of ground oatmeal. Simply rub it over the dry spots in a circular motion, then rinse it off.\nIf you have more buildup than a scrub can handle, try using glycolic acid or another alpha-hydroxy acid. These acids are derived from fruit or sugar, and they exfoliate dead skin cells while strengthening the skin underneath.\nDon’t scrub your skin with a brush or cloth, or use a harsh body scrub. This damages and weakens the skin.",
                "Moisturize in the morning. The jury is out on whether it’s a good idea to cover your face in cream at night. Some research seems to indicate that facial cell renewal happens at night, and if you cover your face with cream, it won’t naturally renew itself with healthy cells. Moisturizing in the morning, however, is a great idea, since it protects your face from pollutants, dirt, dry air, hot air, and everything else you’ll encounter throughout the day that could dry out your skin. After using a washcloth wet with warm water to cleanse your face, apply a moisturizer.",
                "Avoid moisturizers that contain alcohol. With so many moisturizers to choose from, it can be difficult to figure out which one is best for your face. One easy way to distinguish the good from the bad is to check the ingredients for alcohol. This ingredient is drying, so there’s no reason to use it on your face, especially when you have dry skin. If a moisturizer has a long list of ingredients containing lots of words ending in -ohol, avoid it.\n\n\nLook for a natural moisturizer made from a blend of oils and lanolin. These protect your skin and won’t dry it out.\nOn the days when your skin is really dry, try pure argan oil or coconut oil. Choose unrefined coconut oil, since that’s better for your skin than refined coconut oil.",
                "Do a deep moisturizing treatment. Once a week or so, treat your face to a deeply moisturizing mask that will help your skin feel renewed. Mix up a mask from natural ingredients, smooth it over your face, then rinse it off with warm water after 15 minutes. Try the following combinations:\n\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 smashed banana\n1 tablespoon coconut oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 smashed avocado\n1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon milk",
                "Moisturize on the go with coconut oil. Bring a little container of coconut oil with you wherever you go. When you see a patch of flaky skin, apply a little oil to hydrate it and make your skin look smoother and healthier. You can also use coconut oil to treat dry, flaky lips.",
                "Use a humidifier in your bedroom. If the air in your home is dry, it could be making your skin dry out, too. Set up a humidifier in your bedroom to keep your skin moist while you sleep. This is especially helpful during the winter, when heating systems tend to make the air inside extremely dry.",
                "Examine your makeup routine. The ingredients in your makeup may be contributing to your dry skin problem. If you can go without makeup, that would be best, but if you don’t want to stop wearing it, consider switching to oil-based makeup that doesn’t contain alcohol and other harsh ingredients. Look for makeup composed of ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, almond oil, beeswax, and other all-natural items that won’t dry out your skin - in fact they’ll nourish it.",
                "Protect your face from the sun. The sun’s rays can dry out your skin. Once the healthy glow fades, the skin begins to flake and fall off. A certain amount of sun is a good thing, but it’s important to protect yourself from getting burned. As someone with dry skin, however, you need to watch what ingredients your sunscreen contains. Alcohols and other chemicals can dry out your skin, so look for all-natural sunscreens.\n\n\nConsider wearing a hat instead of sunscreen, or doubling up and wearing both. It’s the old-fashioned way to protect your face from the sun, and it works.\nAfter sun exposure, moisturize your skin right away with aloe and other rich moisturizers.",
                "Be healthy from the inside out. The items you ingest have a big impact on the health of your skin. If you want your skin to look hydrated, healthy and glowing, adopt the following good habits. Not only will your facial skin look better, your whole body will feel healthier:\n\n\nDrink a lot of water. If you’re dehydrated, it’ll show up in your skin.\nEat vitamin-rich foods, especially healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. These are found in fish, fish oil, avocados, and nuts.\nDon’t smoke, drink too much alcohol or take drugs. Tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs have a big effect on your skin. They can dry it out and make it look older than your true age. Cut back on these products for healthier skin."

        "wikiHow to Move to Mexico": {
            "intro": "With warm weather, great food, and an affordable cost of living, Mexico has much to offer. If you are seriously considering moving there, expect the process to take several months, regardless of which country you currently live in. Americans may find it easier to relocate due to Mexico's close proximity, but with the right preparations, anyone in the world can move there.",
            "steps": [
                "Ask yourself why you want to move to Mexico specifically. Moving to a new country is a big decision not to be taken lightly. Whether you’re moving there for work, love, or simply a change of pace, take time to clarify your reasons for wanting to move, including how the move will help you reach your life goals. You may find it useful to write your thoughts down in a journal.",
                "Decide which city/region you’d most like to live in. Where you decide to live will be largely based on why you want to move to Mexico — for example, if you’re moving there for work or love, you may not have much flexibility in where you live. While the climate across Mexico is relatively warm and temperate, there are variations across regions.[1] Beyond weather, you may want to live in a city with more shops, or perhaps somewhere less urban.\n\n\nThe Central Highlands are home to cities featuring cobbled streets, cathedrals, haciendas and other remnants of the Spanish colonial period.[2]\n\nThe Pacific Coast is home to the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, making for wonderful natural scenery, with a coastline featuring miles of beaches, resort cities, farmland, plantations, palm trees and more. It can get particularly hot in the summer months here, making winter the busy tourist season.[3]\n\nMexico City and its surrounding area offer a contrast of fertile valley terrain and all the pros and cons of big city life: art, culture, nightlife, overpopulation (over 22 million people), crime and poverty.[4]\n\nThe Yucatán Peninsula comprises 3 states (Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo) for a total of roughly 1.65 million inhabitants. It hosts a growing community of American and Canadian immigrants. Cancún, one of the largest cities in the Yucatán, is the most popular tourist destination in Mexico.[5]\n\nIf you have the time and money, you might find it helpful to travel around Mexico a bit and test out different areas through temporary housing rentals before deciding upon a more permanent residence.[6]",
                "Familiarize yourself with Mexico’s politics, economy and history. If you do not already have work lined up, you might research the unemployment rates and average wages of the particularly cities that you are interested in. You’ll also want to check out the crime rates and political leanings of your destination cities.\n\n\nA recent report shows that while Mexico’s economy has recovered from the 2008 recession, unemployment, gross income disparities, and crime (particularly kidnappings and police corruption) remain major concerns. Violence is at its highest in Mexico’s northern border towns.[7]\n\nMany expats describe Mexicans as being very friendly, but formal and polite in both dress and behaviour. If in doubt about how to behave, ask the locals.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the cost of living. This will vary depending on where you live: as is generally the case, rural areas will generally be less expensive than cities. Expect to pay\n\n\nBetween 3,000 and 8,000 pesos per month for an apartment (depending on location and number of bedrooms);\n1,200 pesos per month for Internet and basic utilities;\n580 pesos per month for a gym membership;\n7 pesos for single bus fare into a city center (336 pesos for a monthly pass);\n2 pesos per minute for local calls on a prepaid phone plan.[8][9]\nNote that mobile phone plans are more expensive than in the U.S. and Europe. To buy an iPhone 5 on a one-year contract with Telcel costs 7,639 pesos, and a plan with 420 minutes, 20 text messages, and 3 GB of data, will cost you 929 pesos per month.[10]\n\nFor international calls you’ll likely be better off going digital. You can do free video calls with many programs now (including WhatsApp and Skype), and apps like Skype offer monthly unlimited phone plans based on country as well. You just need an Internet connection.",
                "Experience creative works by Mexicans. Read works by Mexican writers (Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes are two popular Mexican writers), learn about Mexican artists (Diego Rivera is a popular muralist), watch Mexican films (IMDb has a detailed list of “The 100 best Mexican Movies”).[11][12]",
                "Learn about Mexican cuisine. Buy a Mexican cookbook or look up a recipe for a popular dish online, for example Chilaquiles, Pozole, Tacos al pastor, Tostadas, or guacamole.[13]",
                "Learn Spanish. If you can’t afford to take Spanish classes at your local community college or language centers, consider buying book-CD combos (multimedia learning is much better than simply reading from a book). If that’s still too pricey, there are free language-learning apps available to you if you have a smart phone or tablet (Duolingo is a popular free app).\n\n\nAs part of learning the language, pay attention to body language as well. For example, Mexicans tend to hold gestures such as handshakes longer than Americans or Canadians do. You’ll also want to avoid standing with your hands on your hips or in your pockets.[14]\n\nBe sensitive to dialectical differences in the language. There will be some differences from the Spanish spoken in Spain versus that which is spoken in Mexico; there will even be some differences between the Spanish spoken in Mexico and that spoken in the outlying areas.",
                "Join an online community of expats. As someone living outside of your home country, you will be an “expat” (short for “expatriate”). Joining an online community of expats in Mexico will not only help you prepare for your trip, but will continue to help you once you’ve moved. Through expat forums you can find the best doctors, dentists, hairdressers, grocery stores, or even just make friends with people who will understand your struggles when you have them. [15]",
                "Ensure that you have a valid passport. If you don’t already have a passport, you’ll need to apply for one several months before you plan to leave for Mexico.[16] If you already have a passport, ensure that it will remain valid for your entire stay if possible. To live and work in Mexico, your passport must be valid for a period of 1 year after you apply for the necessary visa.\n\n\nIf you’re planning to be in Mexico for three years and your passport is only valid for one more year, you can avoid a lot of hassle by simply renewing it now.\nMake sure that your passport has at least a few blank pages in it to accommodate stamps and visas. If you do not have any blank pages, check with the appropriate government agency of your country to see whether you must renew your passport, or whether you can have extra pages added to it.",
                "Figure out which visa you need. Which visa you get depends on whether you intend to work in Mexico.[17][18]\n\nIf you do not intend to work, you can simply buy an FMT (tourist) visa through a Mexican consulate or even from the immigration booth after you’ve crossed the border, if you’re driving ($20 USD paid by credit card). If you’re flying into Mexico, the visa will likely be included in the cost of your flight. An FMT visa is valid for 90 to 180 days (roughly 3-6 months); many people stay in Mexico for years on the FMT visa, simply renewing it every 6 months.[19]\n\nIf you intend to work, but do not intend to make Mexico your permanent residence, you’ll apply for an FM3 (non-immigrant residency) visa. There are 10 types of FM3 visas; to find out which one you require, you’ll need to go to the nearest immigration office or consulate. The fees for the visa will also differ, but you can expect to spend up to $500 USD obtaining one.[20]\n\nIf you intend to live in Mexico permanently (or at least for the foreseeable future), you’ll need to apply for an FM2 (permanent resident) visa. It must be renewed every year for five years, after which you can apply for citizenship. The cost for this visa will range from $300 USD to $500 USD.[21]\n\nFor the FM3 and FM2 visas, be prepared for a lengthy application process in which you may need to make multiple trips to the immigration office/consulate.\nAlso for the FM2 and FM2 visas, you’ll need to show proof of a Mexican address and a monthly income of between $1,000 and $2,000 USD, depending on your situation.",
                "Ensure that you do not require any transit visas. If you are passing through any other countries on your way to Mexico, you may require a transit visa. A transit visa allows you to pass through a country without staying there.",
                "Check your driver's license. As Mexico does not require citizens to hold an international license, you can bring along your license from your home country. After arriving in Mexico, apply for a Mexican driver's license by filling out some paperwork and presenting your visa.\n\n\nNote that if you drive into Mexico, you must leave in the same car that you arrived in, as this is marked down on your visa.[22]",
                "Handle your finances, including tax obligations, in your home country. You may wish to consolidate bank accounts into one to keep things more streamlined. You’ll also want to look into signing up with an international money transfer company, which can transfer money from your home bank account to a new Mexican one, usually at lower cost than your bank can.\n\n\nNote that you can only bring up to $500 USD cash into Mexico by air, or $300 USD cash by land.[23]\n\nAlong with any cash you bring into Mexico, you’ll likely find it useful to bring at least one international credit card with you.[24]",
                "Get copies of all medical records and prescriptions for yourself and all your family members. Ensure all vaccinations are up to date prior to the move. Vaccinations relevant to Mexico include: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Typhoid, and Rabies.[25]",
                "Book your temporary accommodations. This allows you to have a place to stay once you arrive in Mexico and gives you additional time to search for more permanent housing and job arrangement.",
                "Make travel arrangements for your arrival in Mexico. Unless you are driving a car into Mexico, this will likely be a flight.",
                "Purchase auto insurance. If you will be driving in Mexico, be sure to buy auto insurance. It isn’t necessary, but the consequences of getting into an accident can be serious. You can purchase auto insurance once you are in Mexico; there is no need to buy it beforehand.[26]",
                "Get a CURP card. Once you’re in Mexico you’ll want to get a CURP (Clave Ú nice de Registro de Población) card. A CURP card is an ID card with your name, date of birth, place of birth, sex etc. on it (much like a driver’s licence). You’ll need your passport, visa, and proof of address to get it. You can apply for it at your local municipal branch once you’re in Mexico.[27]\n\nYou will need this card before signing up for health care in Mexico.",
                "Purchase health insurance. The relatively low cost of health care in Mexico makes it possible to self-insure, but if you are on a budget you may find it less stressful to purchase health care.[28]\n\nThe popular public health care plan is through IMSS (the Mexican Social Security Institute).[29] If you work in Mexico you have most likely been auto-enrolled in it through your company, which will take the cost from your paycheck.[30] Depending on your age, the IMSS plan costs up to $350 USD per year.[31][32][33]\nMany expats say that the IMSS health care is fine for aches and pains, but not as effective for more serious conditions. [34] The quality of the care you receive will also depend on specific hospitals and offices; it’s worth looking at online reviews before going in, if possible.\n\n\nYou can purchase private health care through a number of companies. Just make sure that the policy is underwritten by an insurance company.[35]\n\nSome private doctors and hospitals may accept the health insurance you have back home. Just be sure to check beforehand.[36]\n\nTo give you a sense of private health care costs if you were to pay for them out of pocket: Private doctor's office visits can cost between 150 and 300 pesos, with specialist visits ranging from 500 to 600 pesos. Lab tests are up to 2,000 pesos.[37]",
                "Think about what you want to do while living in Mexico. This will help you decide what to keep and what to throw away while packing. You will also want to think about other factors such as the weather and where you’ll be living — for example, if you know that you’ll be moving around a lot, or that you’ll live in small spaces, you might want to consider digitizing your CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays so that you’re not lugging those around with you. An e-reader is a space-friendly alternative to books.\n\n\nOnce you’ve figured out what you want to bring with you, decide whether you wish to sell, store, or donate the rest. Note that storage fees can add up, so if there’s something you simply can’t get rid of it might be worth shipping it to Mexico.\nIf you choose to ship some of your items, look for quotes from shipping companies at home and in Mexico to get the best price. (Be sure to look at reviews for each company, too, before deciding on one!)",
                "Be aware of what you can take into Mexico. Things like art and furniture can be brought into Mexico duty-free as long as they were bought at least six months before entry, but you cannot bring in live predator fish, dead fish of any kind, and certain drugs, including medical marijuana.[38]\n\nFM3 visa holders have the one-time option to import $5,000 USD worth of personal household items into Mexico duty-free for a $100 USD fee.[39] If you decide to take advantage of this, you’ll need to ensure that you clearly mark each box and provide the Mexican consulate with a list of everything you are shipping, including serial numbers of electronics.\nUnless you're from America, if you’re planning to bring electrical appliances, the electrical voltage requirements may not work for most of the larger appliances. Lower-voltage items, such as MP3 players, will typically adjust. If you are coming from Europe, it is best to sell them and purchase ones once you arrive. This can save you on moving costs.",
                "Ensure that your pets have the appropriate documentation. If you have cats or dogs, they will need health checks and signed certificates of their health by a veterinary professional, dated within five days of crossing the border. The certificate will also need to show that your pets have received their rabies vaccinations.[40] Your local Mexican consulate will be able to inform you further.\n\n\nBirds are more difficult to travel with as they require both paperwork and lengthy quarantine periods that can cost a minimum of $600 USD.[41]\n\nIf you have any other types of animals that you hope to bring with you, consult embassy/government sites for specific details.",
                "Set up your new home. Try to make your new home as comfortable as possible. If you’re on a budget, be smart about what you choose to spend money on. Don’t skimp on things that affect your health such as a good mattress and pillow, for example.",
                "Explore your new surroundings. If possible, don’t jump into work right away. Take a few weeks to get out, wander around your neighbourhood, and explore your new home. Find your new favourite cafe or restaurant. Go on trips around the country. Really get to know it.",
                "Familiarize yourself with local amenities. Figure out the locations of your local grocery stores, doctors, pharmacies, vets (if you have pets), transit etc.",
                "Socialize. It can be isolating living in a new place, especially if it’s just you and not any other friends or loved ones. Joining a group activity (book club, recreational sports team, community centre classes) will help you make friends and feel less lonely. Be proactive and do this soon after you’ve arrived, rather than waiting until you feel sad.",
                "Continue to immerse yourself in the language and culture. Take language classes, go to cultural events. Keep growing and learning. Take advantage of this move!",
                "Keep in touch with your friends and family back home. Being apart doesn’t mean having to lose touch. With social media and programs like Skype, it’s easy and cheap to keep in touch with loved ones. Starting out in a new place is exciting but it can also be very difficult. Having a good support network will keep you going when you’re struggling."

        "wikiHow to Use Your Turn Signal": {
            "intro": "Part of safe driving is letting other drivers around you know what you intend to do. Using your turn signals is not difficult, and it's generally required by law whenever you make a turn or change lanes. By providing a signal, you communicate to others on the road. This keeps you and other drivers safe and prevents accidents.",
            "steps": [
                "Locate the lever on the left side of the steering column.[1] The turn signal is a long lever, usually black or gray in color. When moved up or down, this lever will cause a light on either the left or right side of your car to flash.\n\n\nThe turn signal will not make a sound or light the signal light on your car unless the car is running.",
                "Use the turn signal to indicate a turn to the left. To signal a left turn, wait until you are approximately 30 yards from the corner around which you intend to turn.[2] Ensure you are in the left-turn lane, then push the turn signal lever down gently with your left hand. When the turn signal locks in place, you’ll be able to see a flashing arrow directed to the left on your instrument cluster. You’ll also hear a tick-tock sound which clicks in time with the flashing of the light. This indicates that the signal is operating properly. Return your hand to the steering wheel and continue driving.\n\n\nKeep your right hand on the wheel while flicking the signal lever down with your left hand.\nTurn on the signal before braking to let other drivers know why you are slowing.",
                "Indicate a right-hand turn with the turn signal.[3] To signal a right turn, wait until you are within about 30 yards of the corner you wish to round. Ensure you are in the right-turn lane, then move the lever up with your left hand. The series of events which follow are similar to those which occur when making a signal to turn towards the left.\n\n\nOnce you have moved the lever up, an arrow light will begin blinking on the dashboard instrument cluster. You will also hear a metronome-like sound at regular intervals which clicks in time with the flashing light on your instrument cluster.",
                "Ensure your turn signal turns off after your turn has been completed. Normally, the signal will automatically turn off after you have made the turn. Some turns which are at angles of less than ninety degrees, however, might not trigger the automatic suspension of the turn signal after you’ve made the turn. Failing to turn your turn signal off after you have completed a turn can be illegal and cause confusion for other drivers.[4]\n\nIt is easy to see if your turn signal is still on after you’ve made a turn. Just check the indicator panel above and just behind your steering wheel. Listen for the rhythmic tick-tock sound of the signal blinking on and off. If you see the indicator light blinking or hear the signal sound, reach over to the signal lever with your left hand and gently move it to the “off” position.",
                "Signal your turn even if you are in a turning lane. Some traffic lanes are reserved for left or right turns only. While it might seem unnecessary to indicate you’re turning when it should be obvious based on the lane you’re in, use the turn signal anyway. Drivers who are not familiar with the area or who cannot see the signs due to multiple vehicles ahead of them in the lane will appreciate the indication as to where you are headed, and could clue them into the fact that your lane is for turning in a given direction. Plus, the law requires that you make a turn with your turn signal.",
                "Don’t turn your turn signal on too soon.[5] Only activate your turn signal when there are no intervening streets or alleys between you and the place you wish to turn. If you turn your signal on too soon, someone might think you are turning into a parking lot or down a street which you actually are not. This confusion could lead to an accident or to you being cut off.",
                "Use your turn signal when pulling out from the curb.[6] Before leaving a parking spot on the side of the street, it is important to indicate you’re about to merge into traffic. After getting in your car, activate your turn signal in the direction you wish to merge. For instance, if you are parked on the right side of the street and you wish to merge into the lane parallel to your vehicle on the left side, activate your left-hand turn signal by pulling down on the signal lever.\n\n\nCheck your side mirror to ensure there is space in the flow of traffic to pull out, then turn your wheel hard to the left and accelerate gently.\nReturn the signal lever to the neutral (starting) position by pushing up gently on it.",
                "Get on a highway with your turn signal. When merging onto the highway, accelerate quickly so that you attain the speed appropriate for highway driving. About halfway down the on-ramp, flick your left-hand turn signal on. This will demonstrate that you want to get over, but remember, you do not have the right-of-way when merging. Be careful when merging into high-speed traffic.\n\n\nWhile some highways are constructed in such a way that there is no other option but to merge, some on-ramps turn into independent lanes which connect to the next exit if it is nearby. In either case, using your turn signal will alert other highway drivers to your desire to merge, and will give them time to slow down or change lanes in order to let you do so.\nLook out your left-side window when merging into highway traffic, that way, you can see where cars are relative to you, and will be able to time your merge better. Check your rear-view mirror and left side mirror as you merge in order to identify a gap in the flow of traffic.\nOnce you’ve found your gap, merge quickly to the left.[7] Spend no more than 2-3 seconds moving from the on-ramp to the highway proper.",
                "Exit the highway with your turn signal. If you need to get off the highway, position yourself in the far-right lane on the highway. If your exit ramp is on the left, position yourself in the far-left lane of the highway. Turn the appropriate turn signal on when you’re about 100 yards from the off-ramp. Do not slow down as you approach the off-ramp.[8] Only modify your speed and adjust your turn-signal once you are on the off-ramp.\n\n\nOnce you’ve hit the off-ramp, adjust your turn signal lever to indicate your next move. If you’re going straight, place it in the neutral position. If you’re turning left, press the lever down. If turning right, you can keep your signal on in the right-hand turn position all the way to the end of the off-ramp.",
                "Indicate when you wish to change lanes with your turn signal. If, for instance, you are in the right lane and want to change to the left lane, you can do easily and safely by employing your turn signal.\n\n\nFirst, put your turn signal on in the direction you wish to go. To move into the right lane, push your turn signal up to let others know you wish to move to the right. To move into the left lane, push your turn signal lever down to indicate that you wish to move into the left lane.\nActivate the turn signal at least five seconds before you wish to change lanes.[9]\n\nDon’t switch the signal on for just one or two flickers. Place it in the locked position just as you would when making a turn.\nIf all is clear, turn your wheel slightly toward the lane you wish to merge into. Once you’re completely within the boundaries of the lane, move your left hand to your turn signal lever and switch it off.\nDo not cross multiple lanes of traffic with a single activation of your turn signal. If you know you need to cross many lanes, give yourself the adequate time and space to do so. Plan your lane merges ahead of time."

        "How to Write an Educational Objective": {
            "intro": "An educational objective is an important tool for teaching. It allows you to articulate your expectations for your students, which can inform you as you write lesson plans, test, quizzes, and assignment sheets. There is a specific formula that goes into writing educational objectives. Learning to master that formula can help you write excellent educational objectives for you and your students.",
            "steps": [
                "Differentiate between goals and objectives. Objectives and goals are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a distinct difference between educational objectives and educational goals. Make sure you understand this difference before attempting to write your objective.\n\n\nGoals are broad and often difficult to measure in an objective sense. They tend to focus on big picture issues. For example, in a college class on child psychology, a goal might be \"Students will learn to appreciate the need for clinical training when dealing with small children.\" While such a goal would obviously inform the more specific educational objectives, it is not specific enough to be an objective itself.[1]\n\nEducational objectives are much more specific. They include measurable verbs and criteria for acceptable performance or proficiency regarding a particular subject. For example, \"By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify three theorists whose work on child psychology influenced teaching practices in the US.\" This is a more specific educational objective, based on the educational for the same hypothetical course.[2]",
                "Familiarize yourself with Bloom's Taxonomy. In 1956, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom created a framework to classify different types of learning, as well as a hierarchy illustrating different levels of learning. Bloom's Taxonomy is usually used when writing educational objectives.[3]\n\nBloom identified three domains of learning. The cognitive domain is the domain given the most focus in the world of higher education. Cognitive is the domain used for guidance when writing educational objectives. The cognitive domain focuses on intellectual, scholarly learning and is divided into a hierarchy consisting of six levels.[4]\n\nThe first level is knowledge, which is the ability to memorize, recite, and recall previously learned materials.[5]\nExample: Memorizing multiplication tables.\nExample: Recalling when the Battle of Hastings occurred.\n\n\nThe second level is comprehension. This means taking the facts you know and demonstrating your understanding through organizing, interpreting, translating, or comparing said facts.[6]\nExample: Translating a Japanese sentence into German.\nExample: Explaining why nuclear technology affected President Reagan's political policies.\n\n\nThe third level is application. This means solving problems by applying your knowledge to a variety of situations.[7]\nExample: Using pi to solve various mathematical problems.\nExample: Using \"please\" to ask for things politely not just with Mom, but other people.\n\n\nThe fourth level is analysis. This means taking the facts you learned and reexamining them so you are able to understand why they are true. You are also expected to find evidence to support new claims or inferences you make during your education.[8]\nExample: Understanding the concept of \"fate\" as a predetermined destiny.\nExample: A ball thrown on the ground falls, a rock thrown on the ground falls...but what happens if they are thrown into water?\n\n\nThe fifth level is synthesis. This means organizing information in a new way and discovering new patterns or alternative ideas, solutions, or theories.[9]\nExample: Creating a painting.\nExample: Putting forth a new idea about subatomic particles.\n\n\nThe sixth level is evaluation. This means gaining the ability to present and defend information and make informed judgments about the opinions of others on a given subject.[10]\nExample: Creating a short film humanizing immigrants in your community with commentary on why you believe they deserve respect.\nExample: Writing an essay on why you believe Hamlet really did not love Ophelia.",
                "Learn the characteristics that communicate your intent. When writing an educational objective, there are three characteristics that you need to focus on. These help you effectively communicate the intent of your class and teaching style.\n\n\nPerformance is the first characteristic. An object should always state what your students are expected to be able to do by the end of a unit or class.[11]\n\nCondition is the second characteristic. A good educational objective will outline the conditions under which a student is supposed to perform said task.[12]\n\nCriterion, the third characteristic, outlines how well a student must perform. That is, the specific expectations that need to be met for their performance to be passing.[13]\n\nFor example, say you are teaching a nursing class. A good educational objective would be \"By the end of this course, students will be able to draw blood, in typical hospital settings, within a 2 to 3 minute timeframe.\" This outlines the performance, drawing blood, the conditions, typical hospital settings, and the criterion, the task being performed in 2 to 3 minutes.",
                "Write stem statements. A stem statement should outline the performance expected of a student. You should use measurable verbs to form your stem statement.\n\n\nYour stem statement should begin by referencing the class or lesson. For example, \"After this course, students will...\" \"After completing this lesson, students are expected to...\"\n\nExample: After completing this lesson, students are expected to be able to write a paragraph using a topic sentence.\nExample: After completing this lesson, students are expected to be able to identify three farm animals.\n\n\nYour stem statement outlines the duration of time your students need to have mastered a certain skill. If you're writing an educational objective for a particular lesson, specify that lesson in the objective rather than writing something like \"By the end of this course...\" Instead, opt for, \"By the end of today's lecture...\"\n\nExample: By midterm, all students should be able to count to 20.\nExample: At the end of the workshop, students should produce a haiku.",
                "Select the proper verb. The verbs you use are contingent on which level of learning in Bloom's taxonomy you're conveying. You should write a variety of educational objectives that all speak to differing levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.\n\n\nFor knowledge, go for words like list, recite, define, and name.[14]\n\nFor comprehension, words like describe, explain, paraphrase, and restate are ideal.[15]\n\nApplication objectives should include verbs like calculate, predict, illustrate, and apply.[16]\n\nFor analysis, go for terms like categorize, analyze, diagram, and illustrate.[17]\n\nFor synthesis, use words like design, formulate, build, invent, and create.[18]\n\nFor evaluation, try terms like choose, relate, contrast, argue, and support.[19]",
                "Determine the outcome. The outcome is where you really get to the performance, condition, and criterion. You are expressing what the students are expected to do at the end of a course or lesson.\n\n\nWhat performance do you expect? Do students simply need to list or name something? Should they understand how to perform a task?\nWhere and when will they carry out this performance? Is this for a classroom setting alone or do they need to perform in a clinical, real world environment?\nWhat are the criteria you're using to evaluate your student? What would be considered a passing grade or an appropriate performance?",
                "Put it all together. Once you've laid out the stem statement, chosen your verb, and identified the outcome, put it all together to form an educational objective.\n\n\nSay you're teaching a high school English class and, for one lesson, you're teaching symbolism. A good educational objective would be, \"By the end of this lesson, students should be able to analyze the symbolism in a given passage of literature and interpret the work's meaning in their own words.\"\nThe stem statement identifies that the objective should be met by the end of the lesson.\nThe verbs used are comprehension verbs, indicating this task falls under the second level of Bloom's hierarchy of learning.\nThe expected performance is literary analysis. The condition is, presumably, that the reading be done alone. The expected outcome is that the student will be able to read a work, analyze it, and explain it in her own words.",
                "Make sure your objectives are SMART. You can make sure your objectives work by measuring them against the criteria outlined in the acrostic SMART.\n\n\nS stands for specific. Do your learning objectives outline skills that you are able to measure? If they're too broad, you might want to revamp them.[20]\n\nM stands for measurable. Your objectives should be able to be measured in classroom setting, through testing or observed performances.[21]\n\nA stands for action-oriented. All educational objectives should include action verbs that call for the performance of a specific task.[22]\n\nR stands for reasonable. Make sure your learning objectives reflect realistic expectations of your students given the timeframe of your course. For example, you can't expect students to learn something like CPR by the end of a week-long unit.[23]\n\nT stands for time-bound. All educational objectives should outline a specific timeframe they need to be met by.[24]",
                "Evaluate whether objectives are being met. Solid educational objectives can help you stay on task as a teacher. Periodically review your course to make sure your students are meeting your objectives.\n\n\nObviously, tests, papers, exams, and quizzes throughout the semester effectively measure if educational objectives are being met. If one students seem to be struggling with an objective, it might be an issue of that individual's performance. If every student seems to struggle, however, you may not be effectively relaying the information.\nGive your students questionnaires and surveys in class, asking them how they feel about their own knowledge of a given subject. Tell them to be honest about what you're doing right and wrong as a teacher.[25]",
                "Revise your objectives if necessary. Educational objectives are important. Many educators return to them during a semester if students seem to be slipping. If you're having any issues with teaching, return to your objects and review them carefully. See how they might be revised in a way that would allow you to be a better teacher."

        "How to Write a Thank You Note After a Funeral": {
            "intro": "After the death of a loved one, attending to the niceties of etiquette might be the last thing you want to do. Nevertheless, it's an important part of life to acknowledge others' kindness in times of grief and hardship. Sending a short, simple thank you note is not only basic etiquette, but also a thoughtful way to convey your appreciation for those who were involved in the lives of your late loved one.",
            "steps": [
                "Compile a list of people to thank. A potential list could include the director and staff of the funeral home, as well as people who sent flowers, prepared a meal, or otherwise helped arrange the service. Be sure to send a note of thanks to the officiant who conducted the services. If someone expressed an especially meaningful sentiment to you at the funeral, feel free to include that person on the list, as well.[1]\n\nYou will want to have a notepad and pen handy to jot down each person's name and what they contributed. It's likely to be too much to try to remember on your own. You can delegate this task to another family member, but be sure that they get the first and last names of donors and what they gave or did for the services.\nPeople to include on your list are: pallbearers, officiants, musicians, those who made any kind of donation (food, memorial, or flowers), and those who helped you in a tangible way with the arrangements (contacting the funeral home or babysitting your children, for example).[2]\n\nKeep in mind that you do not need to send thank you notes to every person who attended the funeral. Only those who went above and beyond in their service or assistance need thank you notes. Everyone else can simply be thanked verbally at the service.[3]",
                "Decide between cards or stationery. There are many choices in thank you card design. Choose a card that looks elegant and understated. Or, if you prefer, you can buy nice stationery and fully hand-write your notes. The design, wording, and cards/stationery are ultimately matters of personal preference.[4]\n\nGenerally you should avoid sending an email or ecard in place of a handwritten thank you note, as these can seem impersonal.",
                "Choose blank thank you cards so you’ll have room to write. Regardless of what style of thank you note you select, look for blank cards or cards with minimal writing inside them. This way you will have space to write, and your thanks will stand out.[5]",
                "Keep it simple. Although etiquette is important, do not stress yourself out over these thank you notes. This is an instance of it being the thought that counts. Don’t worry about sending the wrong kind of card or choosing an ugly stationery. You are grieving, and these notes are simply a way for you to thank those who helped you during a tough time.",
                "Speak from the heart. Let the person know how much it meant to you that they were there for you during your time of need and that it meant a lot to you that they contributed in some way. There are many ways to approach the wording in your thank you notes, and all of them depend on what the person did for you and your loved ones. You might simply write two sentences thanking them for thinking of you at this time of great loss in your life and letting them know that it meant a lot to you.[6]\n\nIf you are especially close to the person you’re thanking, feel free to include a personal anecdote or story from the deceased’s life, if you share one with whomever you’re thanking. Personalizing your thank you notes is always a nice touch, but certainly don’t feel that you must do this.",
                "Be specific. In your thank you notes, reference specifically what the person or group you’re thanking contributed after your loved one passed. Whether it was a meal, flowers, or a memorial donation in their honor, specify what you’re thanking them for and let them know that their thoughtfulness meant a lot to you.[7]\n\nBegin your thank you note generally and build to more specifics. For example, good starting points would say something general, such as \"Thank you for your kindness during this difficult time\" or \"Our family appreciates your support during this difficult time.\"[8]\n\nThen you can build to how they helped you specifically. After thanking them for their kindness if they delivered a meal, for example, you might say something like \"The meal you sent us was wonderful because it made one less thing for me to worry about. We truly appreciated it.\" The key is to thank them for their specific contribution.[9]",
                "Avoid mentioning specific dollar amounts. If you’re writing a thank you note to someone who gave a monetary donation in memory of your loved one, thank them for their donation, but don’t mention how much they gave. Simply say that you are thankful for their generosity in honoring your deceased loved one.[10]\n\nGood phrasing for a monetary donation might read like \"Thank you for your generosity in our time of grief. The donation in honor of [deceased's name] means a lot to us.\" This way you convey your appreciation without mentioned how much they gave.[11]",
                "Don’t feel obligated to write long, detailed notes. Two or three sentences is sufficient to communicate your gratitude. The act of actually taking time to send individual thank you notes speaks volumes about how thankful you are. Don’t feel like you need to write long paragraphs to communicate your thankfulness.[12]\n\nSign the notes either with your own name or “Family of [Deceased’s Name].”",
                "Try to send them within two weeks. General etiquette rules dictate that you need to send thank you notes within two weeks of the funeral. Your friends and loved ones know you’re grieving, so if you take longer to send the notes out, don’t worry. A late thank you note is better than no thank you note at all.[13]",
                "Solicit help if you need it. If the prospect of thanking dozens of people after the death of a loved one feels overwhelming, don’t hesitate to ask those around you for help. Even if it’s sending someone to the post office to buy you stamps or envelopes, delegate tasks to close friends or family members.[14]",
                "Remember that thank you notes are not a requirement. Finally, don’t feel bad if you don’t get around to thank you notes. While they are a key component of good etiquette, during times of grief, etiquette can take a backseat to our mourning. So if you can’t emotionally get through the thank you notes, don’t beat yourself up for not finishing them."

                "Pick a spot and dig a hole. The hole should be 1.5' deep and 5' wide. Get it as flat as possible on the bottom.",

There should be enough that you can make a circle to your desired size with the bricks standing on their ends. Form the circle in the hole by standing the bricks on end and putting one next to the other.",
                "Solidify the ring. Use concrete, cobb, clay, or other fire-resistant materials to join the bricks together into a solid, strong ring. Let this material dry completely before continuing.",

If you want to make a person feel comfortable, the best thing to do is to have an \"open stance\" and to direct your body toward that person without being too forceful. Just make eye contact, don't cross your arms, and face your shoulders toward that person. This will make the person feel like you're giving him all of your attention and that you're not just lukewarm about talking to him. Maintain the right distance from the person.\n\n\nPut away your phone. There's nothing more annoying than talking to a person who is constantly checking his cell.\nThough you should look eager to talk to the person, don't look too eager.

But remember that if you're making small talk, then this person is not your closest friend, so you should avoid talking about anything too negative or the other person will be turned off.",
                "Start with a small compliment. Just a simple, \"I love your shoes -- where did you get them?\" can get you into a fun conversation about shoe shopping. Even if the compliment doesn't lead anywhere, it will still make the person feel more appreciated before you start discussing other subjects. You can also use this move earlier, as a way to actually introduce yourself to someone.",
                "Find common ground. Common ground doesn't mean that you and the other person are both die-hard horseback riders. It can just be as the fact that you've both had to deal with a lot of bad weather that week. Anything that the person can relate to and that establishes a connection, however tenuous, can be considered common ground. And just because you don't want to talk about the weather, remember that the \"small stuff\" can lead you to talk about the things that matter to you. Here are some ways to establish common ground:\n\n\n\"Professor Hoffer is hilarious.\"\n\"Ashley throws the most amazing parties.\"\n\"Can you believe all of this rain?\"\n\"I just love coming to Arbor Cafe.\"",
                "Reveal something about yourself. Once you've established some common ground, you can use it to elaborate and say something a bit more personal. You shouldn't say something so personal that it freaks the person out, like, \"I've actually been in love with Professor Hoffer for the last five years,\" but you can ease in to talking about yourself just a bit more. Here are some things to say to follow up with the last statements:[2]\n\n\"He's the best teacher I ever had. He's basically the reason I'm an English major.\"\n\"I actually met Ashley last year, when Ben took me to her Great Gatsby party.\"\n\"The rain is just awful. I'm training for a marathon and had to do my long runs on the treadmill -- it's the worst.\"\n\"Whenever I'm at this cafe, I just really feel like I'm in the zone. Maybe it's the intense drip-coffee -- but seriously, I feel like I can work for hours here.\"",
                "Engage the other person. Now that you've established common ground and have revealed something about yourself, it's time to engage the other person and get her talking by asking her to reveal some information about herself. Don't ask anything too personal, like asking about the person's health, religion, or political views. Just keep it light and fun and ask open-ended questions about the person's interests, job, or surroundings. Here's how you can engage the other person:\n\n\n\"How about you? Are you an English major, or are you here for Professor Hoffer's crazy stories?\"\n\"Did you go to that party, or is this your first time here? It was fun, but I drank too many mint juleps.\"\n\"How about you? Has the rain kept you from doing anything fun this week?\"\n\"Do you come here to do some work, or are you just reading for fun?\"",
                "Follow up with a question or statement. The person's response will influence whether you follow up with a question, a statement, or a joke. Try to find a balance between questions and statements. Too many questions will make the person feel like he's being interrogated, and too many statements won't give the person room to talk. Here's how you can keep these conversations going:\n\n\n\nOther person: \"I'm an English major too. I've always wanted to be an English major, but Hoffer's an added bonus for sure.\"\n\n\nYou: \"Oh, really? What are you thinking of doing with that? It's great to meet another person in this highly lucrative field.\"\n\n\n\nOther person: \"I couldn't go to that party, but I did go to her Cinco de Mayo party last month. That party was crazy.\"\n\n\nYou: \"It really was! I knew you looked familiar. How do you know Ashley? Isn't she nuts?\"\n\n\n\nOther person: \"I don't mind the rain so much, but it made it hard for me to walk my dog! That was so annoying.\"\n\n\nYou: \"You have a dog too? I have a little poodle named Stella. Do you have a picture of your dog?\"\n\n\n\nOther person: \"I'm just here to read for fun. I can't believe I've gone this long without reading The Catcher in the Rye.\"\n\n\nYou: \"I love that book! Some people think it's overrated, but I completely disagree.\"",
                "Notice your surroundings. Once you start really talking to the person and get your back-and-forth banter going, you can also look around for cues for what to talk about next. You can notice anything from what the person is wearing or holding, to a sign on the wall that may apply to both of you. Here are some things you can say:\n\n\n\"Sweet 9ers jersey. That one's a classic. Have you been a fan for long?\"\n\"You ran the New York Marathon too? Which year? I don't know what I did with my t-shirt.\"\n\"What do you think about this a cappella concert tonight? I've seen these flyers all over campus, but I don't know if I want to go.\"\n\"Ah, the American Pageant. That book taught me everything I needed to know about American History. Is that class as easy as it used to be?\"",
                "Take the time to listen. Really listening to things that the person says can help you pinpoint new common ground and to steer the conversation in a more fun or productive direction. The person may make a small comment that's tangential to your question or topic, so keep your ears open and see if something the person says can trigger a new line of conversation. Here are some example of how two people can pick up on cues and steer a conversation in a new direction to connect on a deeper level:\n\n\n\nYou: \"I actually met Ashley on a Spring Break trip. We all went to Mexico with a bunch of friends.\"\n\nOther person: \"I remember her telling me about the trip! I was actually helping her improve her Spanish for it, but I doubt she really used it much -- unless you count the phrase piña colada.\"\n\nYou: \"You speak Spanish? That's awesome. You could have helped me prepare for my study abroad trip to Madrid. My Spanish was okay by the end, but I could have used some help!\"\n\nOther person: \"I love Madrid. My grandmother actually still lives there, so I visit her almost every summer. She takes me to the Prado every Sunday.\"\n\nYou: \"Madrid is like my favorite city! The El Grecos in the Prado are to die for.\"\n\nOther person: \"You like the El Grecos? I'm more of a Goya fan.\"\n\nYou: \"Oh, really? You know, there's actually a new movie about Goya coming out next week -- I think Ethan Hawke's in it! Want to go?\"\n\nOther person: \"Of course!\"",
                "Open up (but not too much). By the end of the conversation, you could reveal something more about yourself, however small, whether it's your obsession with your cat, your passion for yoga, or just your thoughts on your favorite band's new album. Have the person walk away knowing something about you, which could make you connect on a deeper level and make the person think you weren't just shooting the breeze.\n\n\nYou probably shouldn't reveal your thoughts on the meaning of life, lost love, or death in a round of small-talk. Just reveal something about yourself and wait to develop a deeper bond before you get too personal.",
                "If it's going well, mention hanging out again. If you've really enjoyed talking to the person, whether you're developing a crush or a friend crush, you can say that you really liked talking to this person about a certain subject and ask if the person wants to hang out again or get the person's number. Or you can just mention a place where you both will be. Here are some things you can say:\n\n\n\"I'm really serious about seeing that new movie with you. Can I get your number so we can work out the details later?\"\n\"I've never met someone who loves The Bachelor as much as I do. My roommate and I have the best viewing parties every Monday night -- can I get your number so I can send you the info?\"\n\"Maybe I'll see you at Ashley's next party? I hear she won't let you in the door if you're not wearing a real toga, so it'll be something to see.\"",
                "Say goodbye nicely. After you've made small talk but have to go, whether it's to get back to class or to talk to someone else at the party, you should make the person feel important, not like you were just paying your dues by talking to him. Here are some ways to end the conversation politely:[3]\n\n\"It's been great talking to you. I'll let you know how that paella recipe works out for me.\"\n\"I'd love to talk more about Spain, but I haven't said hi to Nina yet, and it looks like she's about to leave.\"\n\"Oh, there's my best friend, Kelley. Have you met her yet? Come on, I'll introduce you.\"\n\"I wish I could keep talking to you, but AP Calculus is calling my name. I'm sure I'll see you soon, though.\""

        "How to Make Your Relationship Survive While Working Opposite Shifts": {
            "intro": "Sometimes, you and your partner may have jobs that require you to work opposite shifts. For example, one of you may be a nurse who works the overnight shift, so that you leave for work just as your partner is coming home from his/her day job in an office. Such situations can make communication and finding quality time together difficult, but there are ways to maintain a strong relationship regardless of the shifts you each work.",
            "steps": [
                "Don't waste the time you get. The last thing you want to do is spend the limited time you get together complaining about how little time you get together. Treat your time together as precious opportunities not to be wasted.[1]\n\nThat said, spending a lazy afternoon (or mid-morning, or late night) doing nothing together is not necessarily wasting time. If you're spending enjoyable time together, it is time well spent.\nSharing a meal together whenever possible offers one ideal way to communicate and spend quality time with one another. For example, if you work the graveyard shift and arrive home at 8 a.m., eat \"dinner\" with your partner as he/she eats breakfast before work.",
                "Borrow from each other's time. When you work opposite shifts, each of you will end up with a lot of solo time, which can in fact have some benefits. Be fair in offering up some of this \"you\" time when it can be transformed into \"both of you\" time. As is the case in so many ways in a relationship, an equitable give-and-take is essential.[2]\n\nOccasionally offer up some of your sleep time to share with your partner, and expect the same of him/her. Don't sacrifice too much sleep, however, or you will be more cranky with your partner and less productive at work.\nWork with your partner to save up vacation days so you can spend them together. Although you may work opposite shifts, you and your partner can schedule time off work or vacation on the same days, so that you can maximize the amount of quality time you spend together.",
                "Make appointments with each other if important or serious topics need to be discussed. It may seem a bit much to have to pencil in times to talk to your significant other, but important discussions require both partners to be mentally alert and emotionally available.[3]\n\nFor example, if you bring up important topics when your partner arrives home tired from work, he/she may lack the energy and mental clarity to fully engage in a serious discussion.\nInstead, set aside a time that allows each of you to mentally and emotionally prepare for an important conversation, be it about money, family, or another topic.\nActually, setting appointments can work for less serious matters as well. It can help you \"block out\" specific periods of time for the both of you to spend some enjoyable time together.",
                "Don't compete with each other. When you work opposite shifts, it can sometimes seem like all your partner does is sleep, because that is what he or she is doing during your brief overlap times. You'll come home, see the sink full of dishes or the living room in disarray, and feel like you're the one doing all the heavy lifting in the relationship. If home chores actually are inequitable, try to remedy that; if not, try to understand how hard your significant other is working while you sleep.[4]\n\nDivide household chores equally between you and your partner. Be realistic about each of your individual skill sets and the times of day (or night) you have to complete the chores, though. You may even want to post a chore sheet so that each of you can confirm that the other is indeed working just as hard as you to keep the household functioning.\nConsider hiring help to complete certain chores during acceptable hours if your partner lacks the skills to complete those chores. For example, if your partner has time off during the day, but lacks the skills to mow the lawn, hire a gardener or lawn care specialist to mow the lawn during daylight hours. You don't need your neighbors calling the cops on you because you're trying to mow by flashlight after midnight.",
                "Keep in touch. Modern technology provides many convenient options for sending along a quick “hello” or planning your upcoming time together. Even small gestures like a short text message or well-timed voicemail can help sustain each of you during long stretches apart.[5]\n\nAlthough you may not be able to spend time together physically, you can still communicate by sending emails, text messages, or by calling each other throughout the day. For example, if you work the graveyard shift, call your partner during the last break of your shift as your partner is just waking up and beginning his/her day.\nOf course, if you do get the occasional chance to drop in while you know your loved one is on a break, take it. Even a few minutes of face-to-face time can provide a needed boost of energy and appreciation.",
                "Establish rules for unilateral action. When you work opposite shifts from your partner, you will have no choice but to divide up some of the important decision-making responsibilities. The person at home during the daytime will primarily be put in the position of making quick decisions on subjects like finances, home repairs, and issues related to any children you may have.[6]\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, you have to demonstrate trust in each other or your relationship isn’t going to survive regardless of what times you each go to work. If you need to be consulted on — or even approve — every little decision that has to be made, then you may have a relationship problem that is bigger than working opposite shifts.\nThat said, it makes sense to lay out some ground rules together for what decisions should and should not be made unilaterally by one of you while the other is unavailable for consultation at work. Perhaps, depending on your circumstances, changing your cable TV plan to get a better deal is OK, while trading in your car for a new one is not. Or, hiring a plumber to fix a leaky sink is a “yes,” while hiring a plumber to completely remodel your bathroom is a “no.”",
                "Rely on your circle of friends for support. Few people can thrive when they have to spend long stretches separated from their relationship partner. While no one else can completely fill this void, you can manage some of the loneliness by turning towards other people you know and care about.[7]\n\nIf you have family nearby, spend more time with them when your partner is unavailable due to work. They can offer you support when you need it, or just someone to talk to comfortably. Also, think of the “bonus points” you can earn with your parents by spending more time with them!\nPartners in a couple often find themselves drifting away from their old, individual friends in favor of “couple” friends. One of the possible advantages of opposite shift relationships is that it is much easier to keep your own circle of friends. You can watch football or go bargain-hunting with your friends without worrying if your partner will be bored or annoyed.\nIf you find yourself turning down some of your limited time with your partner in favor of more time with your friends, however, you may have some deeper relationship troubles brewing.",
                "Do something for you. If you have kids, you’ll likely have no problem filling your time while your significant other is at work. Otherwise, you may find yourself with some free, alone time. Use this time to your advantage by doing something for yourself with it.[8]\n\nSeize the opportunity to take up a hobby that you enjoy but that does not interest your partner. It could be knitting, stamp collecting, gourmet cooking, golf, or any one of a number of activities.\nDon’t feel guilty about using your time this way while your partner is off at work. If it makes you happy, it will benefit your relationship. Encourage your partner to take up his/her own hobbies as well.\nEventually, chances are that your shifts will change, you’ll have kids, or some other factors will cause you to lose this time to yourself. So enjoy it while you can."

        "How to Get Porcelain Skin": {
            "intro": "For those of us with fussy faces, smooth, blemish-free skin may seem impossible, but it may be an easy fix. Your search for perfect, porcelain skin is over! Just follow the simple steps listed below.",
            "steps": [
                "Protect your skin against the sun. Even when it's overcast, ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB) rays pass directly through the clouds. Harmful UV rays from the sun can damage your porcelain complexion and cause dark marks and freckles and early signs of aging, and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. [1]\n\nWear sun screen. Look for one that says \"broad-spectrum,\" meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays, and make sure it has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. [1]\n\nReapply every few hours if you plan to be continuously in the sun long stretches of time.\nIf you go swimming, try applying sunscreen at least half an hour before you get in, so it has time to soak into your skin before you swim and doesn't just dissolve into the water. When you get out, make sure to reapply.",
                "Avoid the sunlight altogether. Sun screen prevents most damage, but the surest way to keep your skin from wilting in the sun is to stay out of it completely. This may be impossible sometimes if you're outside, but there are many ways to cover up.\n\n\nSeek shade where you can find it. Look for an awning or umbrella or a bench under a tree, or retreat indoors until the sun lets up. The sun is strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. [1]\n\nShade may be scarce on sunny days, in which case you should either wear a hat or carry an umbrella.",
                "Find the right cleanser for your face. Everybody's skin comes with its own special set of problems. Some is oily, some dry, some prone to blackheads, some to white. Your cleaning routine depends on your skin's particular symptoms.\n\n\nCleansers can be purchased at any drug or beauty supply store. Store bought cleansers typically combat specific symptoms. Find a cleanser that addresses your skin's needs, or find a few that work effectively together. Cleansers may come in the form of scrubs, toners, astringents or wipes.\nSensitive skin requires gentle cleansers, and should not be scrubbed. Scrubbing irritated skin will aggravate it even more and prevent healing.\nIf your skin is sensitive to certain cleansers or your acne is especially severe, you may want to see a dermatologist. They may prescribe you something, or suggest a couple cleansers that work well against your symptoms.\nYou can also clean your face with baking soda, by dissolving it in water and massaging it into your skin, then rinsing. This helps deep clean your pores, and is considerably cheaper than most facial cleansers.",
                "Maintain your cleaning routine. You should wash your face twice daily, in the morning and at night. Neglecting your cleaning routine will lead to build up in your pores.\n\n\nWashing your face too frequently may dry it out. Make sure you implement moisturizing into your routine.\nBe consistent with your cleanser. If you alternate between too many cleansers, all of which are trying to accomplish different things, your symptoms may in fact intensify.\nTry implementing an electronic cleansing brush in your routine for intensive exfoliation. These are best suited for more resistant skin. If your skin is sensitive, try using a gentle setting so as not to irritate it even more.",
                "Change and wash your pillowcases frequently.",
                "Apply facial masks to keep your skin youthful and smooth. These can be purchased at any beauty or cosmetics store, or spa.\n\n\nTypically you leave your facial mask on for fifteen minutes, unless otherwise specified.\nTo remove it, just rinse with a washcloth (not your fingers!) and warm water, and finish with a splash of cold water.",
                "You can also make your face masks at home using the following ingredients[2]. Homemade face masks are not only more affordable, but also more effective. They contain natural and fresh ingredients that are less likely to conflict with facial cleansers, including:\n\n\nTomatoes: Remove the seeds and mash into puree. Apply to face and let it sit for fifteen minutes as your skin absorbs its antioxidants, vitamins and nutrients. Great for hydrating dry skin and fighting acne. Add lemon and sugar to exfoliate and abolish blackheads.\nAvocado: Can be used alone or combined with honey and lemon. Avocado is rich in Vitamins A and E, and antioxidants and oils that help your skin retain its elasticity and smoothness.\nPapaya: Similar consistency to avocado; try blending with cream or yogurt.\nPumpkin: Much like papaya, pumpkin makes a mighty moisturizer. Try blending it with cream and honey.\nPineapple: Brighten and soften skin by blending pineapple with honey until smooth and applying to your face.\nStrawberry: Combine strawberry pulp with either honey, cream or yogurt to achieve the right consistency. Strawberries not only hydrate skin but also help prevent and alleviate sunburn.\nBanana: Smooths and softens skin. Contains potassium which helps combat dark circles. Best combined with honey and lemon. I suggest you use a very ripe banana; they're much easier to mash.\nLemon: Lemon is often added for its cleansing properties. It functions as a toner or astringent.\nChocolate: Cocoa powder can be mixed with any number of things--yogurt, honey, milk or even clay. Its nutrients and antioxidants help combat effects of aging.\nEgg Whites: Egg white masks, mixed with a little milk and honey, are extremely effective against acne. Best you leave some extra room around the eyes and mouth, because the egg white mask gets tight as it dries out.\nMilk: Milk can be used in combination with other ingredients to make a mask, or by itself, simply to cleanse the face. Just dip a cotton ball in milk and gently massage against your face. This will hydrate and nourish your skin as well as clean it. Milk will also help to even out your skin tone and achieve that porcelain finish that you're looking for. Queen Elizabeth of England and Cleopatra used to take milk baths to achieve that fair and radiant complexion. Milk contains vitamins A and D which work to soften skin.[3]\n\nHoney, yogurt and oatmeal are commonly used in combination with other ingredients.",
                "Drink lots of water. We need water circulating through our bodies at all times. The skin, like any organ, relies on water to flush out harmful toxins.[4] Drinking water also helps prevent dry skin.",
                "Drink white tea. White tea is rich in antioxidants and can be added to any other type of tea without affecting the flavor. Try to integrate white tea into your daily routine.",
                "Eat healthy. Make sure your diet meets all your skin's needs and that you're getting all the necessary vitamins and nutrients. Stay away from greasy foods, especially if you have oily skin already.",
                "Avoid touching your face with your fingers at all costs.\n\n\nIf you have bangs or hair that falls into your eyes you may be tempted to push it out of the way. Be careful not to let your fingers touch your face. Touching your forehead will cause it to get oily and break out.\nIf you wear glasses, places where the glasses rub against your skin are likely to break out. Sweat that rubs against your skin builds in your pores, and every time you touch your face to adjust your glasses, you're adding oil. You may need to wash your face more frequently if you wear glasses.\nAvoid scratching or picking at scabs. This will cause them to scar or leave dark spots in their wake.",
                "Find a powder-compact powder is probably best- that is lighter than your skin, but not too much.",
                "Take a round, stubby brush and apply it in circular motions on your cheeks, then on your chin, then forehead, then nose.",
                "Take a smaller brush-preferably a slanted brush (one that the hairs on one side are shorter than the other side so it looks like a wedge)and connect the areas you applied the powder to with the same powder.",
                "Find a blush that gives your cheeks a nice, rosy, peachy glow, but is not too noticeable. Make sure it looks natural and light.",
                "Use the 1st brush to apply blush in circular motions on your cheeks. Keep it light.",
                "Take the second \"wedge\" brush and dab light blush up on your cheek bones, ending to the side of your eyes. This will make your face look slimmer and more elegant.",
                "For people with tiny red spots, pimples, or red skin on their cheeks, do not use blush. Cover up the red as much as you can with the powder. Chances are you most likely will not be able to cover it all up and your cheeks will be left with what looks like a tiny bit of natural blush."

        "wikiHow to Prepare for the Day That You Get Braces": {
            "intro": "Braces are a tool used by orthodontists to straighten teeth, close gaps, and create a more uniform smile and bite pattern. Like any medical procedure or implement, braces are a commitment that requires advanced preparation as well as lifestyle adjustment in order for the treatment to be successful.",
            "steps": [
                "Get preparatory dental treatment. Before thinking about braces, make sure that you have taken the correct steps to prepare:\n\n\nGo to the dentist. Get a standard teeth cleaning. Not only will this expedite the braces installation process but it will give your dentist the chance to fill any cavities that could be in a spot where the braces will go.[1]\n\nFind a reputable orthodontist and make an initial appointment. Your dentist can likely recommend an orthodontist; you can also look online or in the yellow pages for orthodontists in your area. [2]\n\nRemove wisdom teeth (if necessary). In some cases, there is room in the mouth for wisdom teeth and they will not need to be removed. However, if the teeth grow in crooked or are impacted because there is a lack of space, they will need to be removed before your braces are applied. This is so that they do not interfere with the treatment or modify the final result. Your orthodontist will check for this during your initial appointment and recommend the best course of action.[3][4]",
                "Prepare yourself, emotionally. Braces are a substantial commitment and require a number of lifestyle changes. They can also impact appearance, substantially in some cases. If you are nervous about getting braces, focus on some the benefits that will come from having had them, such as:\n\n\nStraighter teeth\nBetter oral health\nImproved self-esteem\nNatural perfect smile\nCorrect bite with equally distributed forces",
                "Research types of braces and think about what you to get. There are multiple options available, depending on your specific diagnosis:[5]\n\nMetal, or Traditional Braces: the most noticeable type, but these braces let you customize color of elastics more so than other types.\nCeramic or Sapphire Braces: Clear or tooth colored so as to be less noticeable. Can stain more easily if not well-cared for.\nLingual Braces: Attached to the inside of teeth, this is option is less visible, but more difficult to care for and not available for severe cases. Your tongue takes some time to adjust, so you may have some trouble with pronunciation at first. Treatment with lingual braces also usually takes longer.\nInvisalign: A series of 18 to 30 clear plastic molds that are replaced every two weeks. They shape your teeth gradually and less obtrusively than other types, but are more easily lost or damaged and, also, not available for severe cases.",
                "Create a playlist on your music player. Getting braces put on takes a couple of hours. Often dentists and orthodontists let you listen to your favorite music while they work. To build a playlist, think about how getting braces makes you feel (excited? worried? happy? nervous?) and build a playlist around those feelings, focusing on music that will bring you comfort, enjoyment, and reassurance, or maybe just a welcome distraction.",
                "Take a picture. A \"before picture\" will put into stark relief the transformation your braces will have on your teeth and overall oral health. Be sure to take a \"during\" and after picture as well to illustrate the change. [6]",
                "Plan your meals. Know that for up to five days after getting braces, it will hurt to bite and chew, so create a meal plan of foods that are soft. Make sure that there is plenty of variety in the foods you eat so that you will not get bored of eating the same foods all the time.\n\n\nAvoid going on an all liquid diet. You want to balance being kind to your teeth without missing out on nutrition.\nInclude dairy products such as milk, butter, yogurt, and cheese to ensure a good amount of calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These nutrients will help the bones to remineralize.\nTry to incorporate cold or chilled food when possible, as this can soothe any pain associated with braces and help reduce swelling.\nGet an immersion blender. Immersion blenders are perfect for making firm foods soft and pureeing soups and smoothies so they can be consumed without chewing.",
                "Go grocery shopping. It's tricky to plan a menu of cold foods, that require minimal to no chewing, but still provide enough nutrition to keep you going through the day. Below are some suggested food and menu items, focusing on nutritious foods that are soft, do not require chewing, and are easy to prepare:\n\n\nBreakfast: Yogurt and cottage cheese are good sources of low fat nutrition that are cold and won't require chewing.[7]. If you are lactose intolerant or vegan, consider oatmeal or quinoa. Although traditionally served as hot breakfasts, both can be prepared the day before and served cold with a little soy or almond milk.\nLunch: Sticking with foods that are cold and soft, smoothies are available premade in most grocery stores or you can make one yourself. They can be made by combining a cup of greek yogurt with 1 1/2 cups of fruit or vegetable (your choice)1 cup of a complimentary fruit or vegetable juice, and 1 cup of ice.[8]. If lactose intolerant or vegan, silken tofu can be subbed for greek yogurt in equal amounts. You can also include soy milk, soy yogurt, veggie burgers, or other soy products as protein sources.\nDinner: Soups are the perfect solution to ensuring food is soft and can be eaten without chewing. Vegetable soups particularly can ensure that you are getting a variety of key nutrients. There are even cold soups like vichyssoise or gazpacho that can be pureed to avoid chewing. If you are looking for something heartier than soup, consider pasta salads, or even tuna or chicken salad, which are all cold, and easy to chew.\nDessert and snacks: Maintaining the theme of soft, cold, and easy to chew, the following items can act as desserts or snacks while waiting for the pain of getting braces to subside: Ice cream, chilled pudding, Jello, a mashed banana or mashed pears, frozen yogurt, or sherbet.",
                "Think about your post-braces diet, long-term. With braces on, it can be difficult to enjoy certain foods, like sub sandwiches, burritos, apples, corn on the cob-- basically anything that requires you to bite into food. Also consider that you'll be getting your braces adjusted multiple times yearly for the next 2-3 years and will have to revisit your soft food diet periodically. Finally, realize that there are certain foods that you should eat as rare as possible, or even avoid them completely while wearing braces:\n\n\nchewy candies (gummies, caramel, taffy, etc.)\nice\nnuts and popcorn\nhard candy\ncelery and other fibrous foods[9][10]",
                "Visit the pharmacy. Getting braces will not be the most painful experience of your life, but it will be uncomfortable for a few days. Ease this with an over-the-counter pain reliever containing naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Consult the pharmacist regarding dosage during the week after you get your braces or simply follow the instructions on the packaging.[11]\n\nMake sure that you eat something before taking any pain reliever.",
                "Ask your orthodontist. Your orthodontist knows how to prepare you for life with braces and will provide you with resources like dental wax and rubber bands to help with your treatment. They may also provide you with a \"starter kit,\" containing samples of products that will help you adjust to life with braces and make the entire experience more bearable.",
                "Follow a daily dental hygiene routine. Braces will require additional steps to ensure your teeth stay healthy and cavity free. Be sure to brush twice daily with a good-quality toothpaste and pay attention to what parts of your mouth are the hardest to reach. These parts will be even more difficult once you get braces, so start thinking about what would help you keep those areas clean.",
                "Create a shopping list. Your orthodontist can give you recommendations for products and brands that will help you keep your teeth clean while wearing braces. Below is a list of commonly suggested items:\n\n\nA waterpik. Braces make it difficult for ordinary brushing to do the job. Waterpiks spray a concentrated stream of water through the tip of a wand and can be used on even the hardest to reach corners of your mouth, which can eliminate the bacteria that gets stuck between your teeth and gums. This bacteria can cause your gums to bleed.\nMouthwash. Braces make it easy for food residue to collect in and around your teeth. A rinse with mouthwash for 60 seconds can help and also ensure fresh breath and provide antibacterial protection.\nThreader Floss. Ordinary floss is difficult to use with braces; however, flossing is an important part of dental hygiene. Threader floss are small plastic strands with a long loop on one end. They can be threaded through the small gaps between teeth and the loop functions the same way floss would, removing obstructions like food residue and tartar.[12]\n\nProxabrush or Bi-Level brush. A proxabrush is also called a \"Christmas Tree Brush\" because of its shape. It has a triangular, conical shape and can fit under the arch wire of your braces to give a thorough brushing. Or get a bi-level brush, designed with shorter bristles in the middle from brushing over your brackets.[13]\n\nOral Analgesic. While your mouth is adjusting to braces, it is not uncommon to experience sores on high-friction areas. There are liquid, gel, and paste types of oral analgesic; decide which one is right for your needs.",
                "Get a mouth guard. If you play sports, be sure to wear a mouth guard. With some sports, like basketball or football, mouth guards are already standard. When you are wearing braces, however, any athletic activity-- especially those that involve throwing a ball or physical contact with other players--could result in facial injury, stitches, veneers, or resetting the braces entirely if hit in the mouth.[14] A mouth guard that fits your needs will be available at any athletics or sporting good store.\n\n\nYou can also ask your dentist or orthodontist to provide you with a custom made mouth guard if the ones in the store do not fit properly because of your braces."

        "wikiHow to Do Pilates": {
            "intro": "Pilates is a type of fitness system that consists of movement exercises that are designed to tone the body, strengthen the muscles, increase flexibility and agility, improve posture, and heighten concentration skills. The movements require physical control, mental focus, and special breathing that’s supposed to help your mind and body work together. Pilates exercises can be performed on a mat, where you create resistance using your own body weight and sometimes simple equipment like resistance bands. The first step in learning Pilates is learning some basic poses, and from there you can move on to more advanced positions and learn new movements. Some of the movements are performed on your back, while others are done on your stomach, your side, or in plank position, while others still are performed sitting or standing.",
            "steps": [
                "Dress appropriately. For Pilates, you want stretchy, breathable fabrics and comfortable clothes that allow you to move freely. At the same time, you don’t want anything too loose or too long that you could get caught in or trip on. Popular clothing choices include:\n\n\nTank tops and tight t-shirts\nYoga pants\nShorts or capris-length pants in a spandex-type material",
                "Get yourself an exercise mat. Yoga mats aren’t just for toting around and looking hip! They actually provide some protection for your bones and joints during floor exercises, and the foam surface provides grip, making it easier to hold poses, and preventing you from injuring yourself or pulling a muscle.",
                "Find a space. To do Pilates mat exercises, you need a large open space and a flat surface. A living room or bedroom will work if you can move some lighter furniture around. Make sure you have enough room to:\n\n\nLie down on your back and extend your arms and legs out 90 degrees to the sides.[1]\n\nStand up and stretch your arms to the ceiling without touching the ceiling.\nLie down on your back in the same position (legs stretched out toward one wall and arms stretched out toward the other).",
                "Learn the proper breathing technique. A major part of Pilates is learning the controlled breathing, which helps you concentrate, oxygenates the blood, and helps you coordinate your movements. Proper breathing should be practiced throughout the entire workout. To breathe properly for Pilates:[2]\n\nLie flat on your back with your neck long and relaxed.\nPlace one hand on your ribs and one on your lower abs.\nInhale deeply through your nose, pushing air into your abdominals and filling your ribcage.\nExhale through the mouth and push the air out by contracting your abdominal muscles.\nContinue inhaling and exhaling in this way.",
                "Know what to work toward. Along with proper breathing, some of the main tenets of Pilates are being able to center yourself (which helps with relaxation), concentrating your full attention on each motion and controlling every movement, and being aware of proper body alignment and striving to maintain it.[3] Not only will you get a better workout by focusing on these things, but you’ll also prevent injuries.\n\n\nAlways keep your core engaged during your Pilates workout.",
                "Learn the bridge. There are several Pilates moves that are performed from a supine position (meaning lying on your back). All supine moves will begin with you lying on your back. For the bridge, bend your knees and lay your arms on the ground at your sides, palms on the ground. Plant your feet flat on the floor and hip-width apart, about halfway between your bum and where they’d normally be if your legs were fully extended. Then:\n\n\nPress your weight evenly into your feet, shoulders, and arms as you squeeze and lift your hips into the air until your body forms a straight line between your shoulders and knees.\nHold the pose as you inhale and exhale three times.\nLower yourself back to the floor.\nRepeat five times.",
                "Master leg circles. Straighten your arms and legs and lay your arms on the ground at a 45-degree angle from your body. Keep your left leg on the ground and raise your right leg straight up toward the ceiling. If that is too difficult or uncomfortable, bend your left knee.\n\n\nKeep your hips stable as you trace five volleyball-sized circles in the sky with your right leg.\nReverse the direction of the circle and trace five circles going the other way. Put your leg back on the ground.\nSwitch legs and repeat.[4]",
                "Do the abdominal criss-cross. Pull your knees in to your chest. Raise your head and neck and place your hands behind your head. Extend your right leg out straight and gently twist your body so your right elbow moves toward your left bent knee. Bend your right knee and bring it back to your chest again, and as you do so, straighten your left leg out and gently twist your body so your left elbow moves toward your right bent knee.[5]\n\nRepeat five times.",
                "Master the hundred. Lie down with your knees, feet, and hands in position as though you were going to go into bridge pose. Lift your head, neck, and shoulders slightly off the ground. Keep your arms straight and at your sides as you lift them off the ground to a 45-degree angle.\n\n\nAs you inhale for five seconds and exhale for five seconds, pulse your arms up and down 10 times.\nRepeat this 10 times, for a total of 100 arm pulses.",
                "Do the swan. Prone means lying flat on the ground on your stomach, and all the prone positions begin with you lying down on your stomach with your forehead resting on the ground. For the swan, place your hands under your shoulders as though you were going to push yourself up. Tuck your elbows in beside your body. Keep your feet hip-width apart.\n\n\nPress your pubic bone into the ground and press into your palms as you lift your face, neck, and chest off the ground, bending at your lower back so you are sitting up like a sphinx. Inhale, exhale, and lower yourself back down.[6]\n\nRepeat two more times, lifting yourself slightly higher each time.\nAlways keep the tops of your feet flat on the ground.",
                "Go for a swim! Stretch your arms straight in front of you (as though you were swimming) on the ground. Squeeze your thighs and heels together. Lift your head, neck, and chest off the ground. Lift your right arm and left leg as you squeeze your glutes (that’s one stroke). Return your arm and leg to the ground, and lift your left arm and right leg[7] (that’s two strokes).\n\n\nComplete 24 strokes.",

        "How to Care for Hermit Crabs": {
            "intro": "Hermit crabs (affectionately called hermies) are great pets to have. They may not be as cute or cuddly as a puppy, but they are fun to play with and will teach kids the meaning of caring for another living creature. Follow these steps to set up a crab's habitat (a crabitat) and care for your hermie.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure you get the right size of tank. A ten or twenty gallon tank is good for two to four small hermits. A twenty to forty gallon tank is good for a dozen small or three to four large hermits. Hermit crabs are social animals and should have at least two other crabs with them. The proper home for your crabs should be one that holds in humidity, but still lets in fresh air. A fish tank or reptile aquarium usually does nicely. You can even rinse out that old leaking tank from the attic and use it! Acrylic terrariums tend to work better, as they hold the humidity and heat more efficiently.",
                "Make sure your hermit’s home is the right humidity. You should buy a hygrometer (humidity gauge). These will help you to monitor and maintain a 75-85% relative humidity. Hermit crabs breathe through (hardened) gills, and can't breathe properly unless the air is humid enough. The ideal range is at least 75% relative humidity. Humidity lower than 70% will cause suffocation, which kills slowly over several weeks or months and is extremely painful.\n\n\nA great way to increase your tank’s humidity naturally is to add natural moss to your tank. It increases the humidity, and hermit crabs eat it. Look for moss like Fluker’s Reptile Moss at your local pet store. Sponges also work well, and can also be found at a pet store. But sponges get dirty easily and need to be changed out every two to three weeks.",
                "Make sure your tank is the right temperature. Hermit crabs are tropical animals and do best in warm temperatures. 75-85°F is the proper temperature range. Heat damage is irreversible, and temperatures that are too low slow down a crab's metabolism. An under-tank heater designed for hermit crabs, mounted on the back of the tank is a good way to keep your tank humid. An improper environment can cause your crab to become lethargic and inactive, lose limbs and could potentially cause death. Buy a thermometer to keep an eye on the tank's temperature.",
                "Get substrate. Substrate is the layer of material you place on the floor of the tank. Sugar-sized arrogate sand is the only sand you should use because other grades could cut the crab, and play sand may have harmful fills. Use dechlorinated salt water to wet the sand to a \"sand-castle\" consistency. You also can use compressed coconut fiber (Sold as Eco-Earth or Jungle Bedding). Expand the coco-fiber in the same salt water you would give your crabs to prevent mold/mildew. Substrates that crabs can not dig in, such as aquarium gravel (can not hold caves) or calcium sand (clumps and can have a foul odor) are not acceptable as a substrate. Your substrate should be at least 3-5 times the height of your largest crab, and should be a material the crabs can easily dig and build caves in to relieve stress, hide, and molt.\n\n\nMany crabs also like to bury and even molt in damp moss such as Fluker's Reptile Moss (not decorative or Spanish moss!)",
                "Keep the substrate clean. Dirty substrate can lead to mold which can be harmful to your hermit crabs. Change it every 6 months. However, every month you should do a brief check to see if there is any mold growing, or an ant or mite infestation. If you see either of these things, change the substrate immediately. It's a good idea to \"spot clean\" any dung and food the crabs have dragged from the food bowl or buried. You should only clean the substrate when your hermit crab is not molting (a crab who has burrowed underground and is going through a process to shed and regrow it's exoskeleton). Never move a molting crab.\n\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, you can sterilize your sand substrate. Sand can be sterilized in the oven. Put the sand in a large roasting pan (one used only for this purpose!) and place it in the oven. Set the temperature to 250 degrees (F), (120 degrees Celsius) and let it be for about 2 hours.\nOnce every two to three weeks, boil all the shells and dishes in your tank in a pan of dechlorinated salt water. Doing this will insure that that mold and bacteria will not grow and harm your crab. Allow the bowls and shells to cool before placing them back in the \"crabitat\".",
                "Get climbing-toys. Hermit crabs love to climb! In fact, in the wild, they will climb large rocks exposed by low tide to search for food. choya logs or stumps are great for this. Choya is not toxic, and has holes in it for them to grab on to. You can lean it in a corner of your tank, just don't place it too high or your crabs will climb out. Lego's and hemp nets work well too. Hermit crabs are sometimes called \"tree crabs\" because they will climb trees to eat insects and vegetation. Do not, however, buy painted toys, as paint could be harmful to crabs if it is ingested.\n\n\nNatural toys: Natural rocks and seashells that you pick up at the beach are great things to scatter around the \"crabitat.\" Clam shells even make great food dishes. Just make sure to boil them in boiling water so that they become sterilized before you place them in the tank.\nPlastic toys: Plastic plants made for reptiles are great for crabs to climb and hide in, just remember to use the lid of your tank so the crabs can't climb out. Make sure they aren't eating the plastic, and remove it right away if they are!\nNever use reptile \"half pine logs\", as pine is an irritant to the crabs and can be toxic.",
                "Provide your hermit crabs with a hiding place. Hermit crabs, like most animals, want a place to feel secure and hide when they feel threatened. You can use a half coconut shell that they sell at pet stores for small crabs, or use broken pots, large shells, etc. Just make sure that the crab won't get stuck and, preferably, is able to dig out if it does.",
                "Add some live plants to your tank. Live plants can be a great addition to any tank. In particular, plants like bamboo (make sure it's real bamboo and not Dracaena Sanderiana, which is sold as \"lucky bamboo\"), Venus fly traps bromeliads (air plants) and spider plants are among the safe plants. Be forewarned--your hermit crabs may snack on them, so there's no guarantee the plants will have time to grow",
                "Provide your hermies with water. All species of hermit crab need to have access to both freshwater and saltwater. You will need to provide two water dishes for the crabs. Hermit crabs need to balance the salinity of the water in their shells; the dishes should be at least deep enough that your crab can get water in its shell (C. Perlatus, A.K.A. Strawberry hermit crabs, need to be able to submerge themselves), but make sure they are able to get out. A good way to do this is to provide them with a sloping water area, where one part is shallow and easy to climb out of, while the other is deep and they can submerge themselves in the water. Line the area with rocks or something they can grip on. Plastic is too slippery and they will have trouble climbing the slope.\n\n\nIf you have large and small crabs together, you can put small rocks or a small natural sponge in the water dishes so that it is deep enough so large crabs can let water in its shell, but small crabs will not become trapped in the water dish and drown.\nYou can buy aquarium salt for marine fish (not freshwater fish) from most pet stores and a little goes a long way. Never use salt intended for human consumption because the anti-caking agents can be harmful. Most hermit crab brand salts are also table salts. Pre-mixed \"hermit crab water\" does not have the correct salinity. Use a brand like Instant Ocean, Oceanic, etc.",
                "Make sure the water is dechlorinated. The chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals in most tap water can kill hermit crabs by causing the gills to blister (causing eventual suffocation). Aging the water will remove the chlorine, but not the chloramines, so dechlorinator is a must if you use tap water. Zoomed water conditioner is a good brand to use.\n\n\nIf you don't want to dechlorinate tap water, you can use spring water instead. However, make sure nothing has been added to the water. For example, Dasani water contains magnesium sulfate \"for taste\", and that is bad for the crabs.",
                "Know that there are different kinds of hermit crabs you can buy. There are six types of hermit crabs available for sale in the United States. All of them are in the genus Coenobita.\n\n\nThe most common type out there is the Caribbean (Coenobita clypeatus,) which is also called \"PP\" for purple pincher due to, you guessed it, its large purple pincher. Wild Purple Pinchers are found in the Caribbean Islands. Most likely, when you see a hermit crab in a store, you will be seeing one of these guys. The Purple Pincher is the best one to start with because the others are more delicate and require much more detailed and intense care. The other types are Rugosus \"Rug\" or \"Ruggy\" (rugosus), Strawberry (perlatus), Ecuadorian or \"E\" (compressus), Cavipe or \"Cav\" (cavipes), Komurasaki \"Viola\" (violascens), Indonesian or \"Indo\" (brevimanus).",
                "Handle your hermies with care. Be patient with them when you first get your hermies--they will take a little time to adjust to their new home. When you get your hermit crabs, leave them in the cage for a few days. When you see that they don't hunch into their shell when you pass by then wait another day and try to hold your hermit crab. Let your hermit crab explore your hand and get used to you.\n\n\nOnce you get them home, they go through a \"De-stressing\" period that can take as little as a few days and as long as two months. During this time, change out their food and water regularly and do not disturb them. Sometimes, even with the best efforts of even the most experienced crabber, hermit crabs can succumb to Post Purchase Stress (P.P.S.), and die.",
                "Know that crabs go through molting and need extra shells. If your crab digs under the substrate for a couple of weeks, don't worry. As long as it doesn't stink like dead fish, he's OK. Please do not disturb your crab during this time. He will need to be alone and if he is bothered, the stress could kill him. Once in a while, a crab's exoskeleton gets a little tight, and like a snake shedding its skin, a crab will shed its exoskeleton and grow a little bit. Don't take the exoskeleton away from the crab! He will need to eat it in order to harden his new exoskeleton.\n\n\nIf you have a sick crab, don't panic. Keep an isolation tank in a closet with enough substrate to dig under completely and ample food and water. If a crab is acting sick, he may be about to molt. This tank should also be kept with proper humidity and temperature as was mentioned previously.",
                "Provide shells for your hermie. When hermit crabs grow, they need bigger shells. It is important to keep plenty of extra hermit crab shells similar to your crabs' sizes in the tank at all times. Once a month or so, rotate a few undisturbed shells out with different styles of shells.\n\n\nPurple Pincher Hermit Crabs prefer the shells with round, circular openings. They will choose circular openings over the oval openings. Ecuadorian Hermit Crabs will prefer an oval opening, because they have flatter abdomens.\nNever buy painted shells! Although companies may claim the paint is safe, the paint can chip off, and if the crabs eat it, it can be toxic. Most hermit crabs, when presented with a choice, will pick a \"natural\" shell over a painted one, even if it's not the right size. See the Warnings for information on what kinds of shells to avoid.",
                "Provide a steady and varied diet. Hermit crabs are scavengers by nature and will eat almost anything. Beware of commercial food, as it has many preservatives, such as copper sulfate, that may harm your little hermit. Don't feed them anything spicy, hot, or with preservatives in it.\n\n\nHermit crabs love silver sides and shrimp that are fresh, freeze-dried krill, blood worms, etc., and other seafood. You can normally buy these fishy foods at your local grocery store.\nIf you cook, set aside a piece of steak or chicken, non-marinated to grill lightly for the crabs. They also eat raw meat.\nIf you have more than twenty crabs or so, try getting a fish head from a local fish market. They are usually happy to give them away. You can put all of your crabs in a large tank or a large clean Rubbermaid storage container, (clear, no lid, or lid with VERY large holes cut in it) drop in the fish head, and a water-bowl, and leave them in there to eat for a few hours. You will mostly likely not want to do this very often, since the stench is pretty bad, but your crabs will love you for it!",
                "Know what fruits and veggies hermies like. Aside from eating meat, hermit crabs also love different fruits and vegetables, among other scraps (they are scavengers after all.) Remember to change their food almost every day or night. Hermit crabs love to bury their uneaten food, and this can cause molding and is messy.\n\n\nHermit crabs love fresh fruit like pineapple, apple, pears, grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon, mango, papaya, strawberries, bananas, etc. Wash your fruit thoroughly before you cut it, to avoid pesticides.\nCrabs will go crazy for coconut shavings.\nHermit crabs will also eat natural peanut butter on whole wheat toast, hard boiled eggs, egg shells (boiled), popcorn (plain, unsalted and unbuttered).\nAvoid anything from the Allium species of plants (onion, garlic, etc.).",
                "Play with them. Some Hermit crabs love attention. When they are awake, carefully take them out of their crabitat. What do they like to do? Climb! Let them climb all over your shirt while you are watching TV or exercise them as they walk across both your hands (like a crab treadmill). It is important that they never fall, and are not out too long because they need humidity. Falling from a height of 3 feet (0.9 m). can be fatal for them, and fear of falling is the number one reason crabs pinch. Keep them in a position where they aren't going to fall and they likely won't pinch.\n\n\nRemember that they need humidity. Typical house humidity is only 40% and even less with AC and heat. When a crab's gills are exposed to low humidity it feels similar to how we feel when we hold our breath for too long.",
                "Be aware that hermit crabs may pinch. While they generally pinch only when they are afraid or feel cornered, they may pinch for no reason, so be prepared. Misting or running tap water on crabs to get them to release their grasp can hurt them and will likely result in them holding on longer and tighter. Please be very careful when handling them. You can avoid being pinched by holding your hand flat and tight so that the hermit crab will not have (as much) skin to pinch."

            "steps": [
                "Find the right salts. Although every bath salt base requires at least epsom salts, you can choose to add other salt mixtures to give different appearances and benefits. Sea salt can be added for a finer grain, and pink Himalayan salt could be used to increase the mineral content of your bath salt mixture.",
                "Pick an essential oil. Although you can create a scent-less bath salt mixture, adding essential oils creates a lovely perfumed atmosphere when you take your baths. Choose floral, fruity, or woody scents to set the right mood for your best relaxation.\n\n\nPopular floral scents include lavender, rose, and lilac. These all help to ease stress and aren’t too heavy, offering a light airy feel to your bath.\nStronger scents include eucalyptus, citrus, and peppermint. These help to invigorate your senses and focus your mind.\nMix multiple scents to create your own unique smells. Only add a few drops of each scent to keep the ultimate perfume levels proportional.",
                "Decide on dried plants. You can choose to add dried herbs or flowers for added looks and scents to your bath salts. Try adding rosemary, thyme, or peppermint leaves that have been coarsely ground. Or, use dried rose or lavender petals. Leave these whole or grind them in a food processor before adding to your salts.",
                "Choose a color. It isn’t necessary to add color to your salts, but to make them look professional you can add a few drops of food coloring. Choose colors that match your scents, such as purple for lavender, or green for eucalyptus.",
                "Measure your ingredients. You will need one cup of sea salt, one cup of epsom salt, and one teaspoon of an essential oil of your choice. You can also choose to add dried herbs or flower buds for extra scent; grind these in a food processor to a powder before mixing it with your salts.",
                "Incorporate all the ingredients. In a bowl, mix the salts together first. Then, slowly add your essential oils. Make sure to spread them thoroughly and to mix well, so that all of your salts come into contact with the oil.",

                "Mix the ingredients. Start by mixing the epsom salt and baking soda together. Then, add the liquid glycerin and combine well. Use as much scented oil as you would like, but make sure that you thoroughly mix it with all of the ingredients.",
                "Store the finished product. Pour all of the bath salt mixture into a container with a lid, and store it between uses. Add a few tablespoons to hot bathwater and enjoy the skin-softening effects![2]",
                "Measure your ingredients. Use two cups of epsom salts, two cups of borax, ½ a cup of kaolin clay powder, and essential oils of your choice. The kaolin clay and borax work together to soften the water and your skin, as well as to provide other mineral health benefits including muscle relaxation and reduced tension.",

            "intro": "Planning birthday parties is both fun and stressful. There are many elements of a good party to take into consideration, and the responsibility of the party being a blast falls on you. There are some fail-safe steps to take in order to plan a fantastic birthday party that will have everyone involved and having fun. Make sure that you have fun along the way!",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a date for the birthday party. The sooner you choose a date, the sooner you can get started with planning other elements of the party.\n\n\nConsult with the person whose birthday it is to determine a good day for the party. Check his/her schedule and take note of any holidays around that time. Keep in mind that many people travel for different holidays.\nIt is advisable to host the party on a weekend. More people will be willing and able to come if it is on a weekend, because many people do not have to work on the weekends.[1]",
                "Select a time for the party. Appropriate times will vary based on who the party is for and the age of that person.\n\n\nIf you are throwing a birthday party for a child, host it in the late morning or early afternoon. This is most convenient for families.\nIf you are throwing a party for an adult, then an evening party is appropriate.",
                "Decide on a budget for the party. Parties can easily consume a great deal of money, so it is important to come up with a budget and stick to it.[2]\n\nCome up with an overall budget, meaning a total amount that you want to spend on the birthday party. Most people believe that a budget up to £200-300 is reasonable, and many feel keeping party costs under £150 is completely doable.[3]\n\nBreak down each element of the party (e.g. invitations, food, drink, decorations, venue) and decide how much should be spent in each area.",
                "Create a guest list for the party. There are a few reasons for doing this.\n\n\nA guest list will help you ensure that no one is forgotten when sending out invitations.\nIt will aid you in deciding where to hold the party. A guest list of 12 people means you could host the party in someone's home, if you wanted to do so, but a guest list of 50 people will likely need to be held somewhere else.\nThis will eliminate the risk of people the birthday person does not want attending showing up to the party.\nHaving a number of guests in mind enables you to determine how much food and drink will need to be provided, if you are doing that yourself or having it catered.",
                "Consider where to have the party. This involves knowing the individual for whom the party is being thrown.\n\n\nTake into consideration what the birthday person wants. If he/she wants a more elaborate party, then work to plan the party in a venue that enables that. If he/she is into small gatherings with close friends, then aim for that instead.\nYou will need to decide if you want to have the party in your home or someone else's home in order to keep the venue cost-free.\nThink about making a reservation at a restaurant if your party is of a reasonable size. Most restaurants can accommodate up to about 25 people without too much issue.\nAnother idea is to host the party at a party or banquet hall. This will be a more expensive option, but it can easily accommodate more people.\nThink about the guest list and keep in mind if any guests need accommodations. Be sure that wherever you choose caters to people who need certain accommodations, like wheelchairs.",
                "Decide if the party should have a theme. Themed birthday parties can be a lot of fun, but they can also end up being more costly when you consider buying everything to match the theme.[4]\n\nWeigh the pros and cons of having a themed party based on the person whose birthday it is. Would they like a themed birthday party?\nConsider whether it is a kid's party or an adult's party. Choose a theme that is age-appropriate, if you decide to go this route. For example, appropriate themes for children would be based on kid-friendly television shows or movies, circus, movie theater, a children's book, or carnival. On the other hand, appropriate themes for adults might be a black-and-white affair, casino, a decade theme, or an adult movie or television show.",
                "Purchase and send out invitations. Once the earlier details are decided upon, then it is time to send out invitations to the guest list.\n\n\nIt is best to send out the invitations about 3-4 weeks in advance of the party in order to give people enough time to plan for it. Be sure to include RSVP information on the invitation.\nSending out the invitations after you have decided on the earlier details ensures that you have the guest list secured and that you have decided on whether to have a themed party, making you more organized.\nBe sure to reach out to some of the invited guests for help. They can help set up, clean up, provide food, decorate, and more. It is not necessary to do it all by yourself![5]",
                "Create a plan for the food and beverages. Based on what you have decided for the party, you have different options for these aspects.\n\n\nDecide what type of food will be best for the party. If you chose a theme, then make sure the food flows with that theme.\nKnow whether any of your guests have food allergies. If so, be sure to provide options that are safe for them to eat or let them know that they are welcome to bring their own food.\nBe realistic about how much food and drink to provide based on the length of the party. A party that is planned to be an hour or two might only require refreshments and birthday desserts, while a party that is meant to last for several hours will need more of a meal.[6]\n\nMake sure that you plan for enough food and drink to cater to all of the guests. Err on the side of too much food rather than too little.",
                "Know your obligations for providing the food and drinks. You may or may not be responsible for providing these things, based on your decision about where to host the party.\n\n\nIf you are throwing the party in your home or someone else's, decide if you will make all of the food yourself. If not, then reach out to others and ask for their assistance in providing the food and drinks. A potluck is a great idea!\nIf the party is going to be held at a restaurant, then no real planning needs to be done in this area, as the restaurant will take care of that for you!\nIf the party is going to be at a party or banquet hall, then you need to check with their staff about catering options. Find out if you can bring the food, if they will cater the food, or if they have particular vendors they use to cater food for parties.\nDecide whether alcohol should be provided, if it is an adult birthday party. For example, if the birthday person does not drink and has many friends and family who do not drink, then alcohol would be unnecessary.[7]",
                "Gather decorations for the party. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of the planning!\n\n\nIf you decided on a theme for the party, then this will be easy, as you will simply buy decorations to match the theme.\nIf you did not decide on a theme, then think about what the birthday person would want. Does he/she like a lot of decorations, like balloons, streamers, and confetti? Or is he/she more of a laid-back person who is not interested in decorations? Purchase decorations accordingly.\nDecorations are not as important for an adult's birthday party, but they are quite important for a child's birthday party. Kids are imaginative, so even household items can contribute to the decorations if you want to save money in this area.[8]",
                "Choose entertainment options for the birthday party. This could involve several different types of entertainment.\n\n\nFor a child's birthday party, there are many options. Games are great, but they often require supplies, so keep that in mind. You could have a story time, if it goes with the theme. Another idea is to have music playing. You could also hire an entertainer, such as a clown, a magician, or a scientist, if it is in your budget.[9]\n\nAn adult's party can just as easily include games. It would also be helpful to have music playing in the background, either via a disc jockey or via a homemade setup with a computer or smartphone and speakers. If the party is going to be out on the town, then the entertainment could come in the form of a live band or an activity, such as a comedy show.",
                "Choose what dessert will be. For many birthday parties, this is the most important part!\n\n\nMost of the time, the birthday person will want a cake, especially if it is a child. Decide whether you are going to make the cake yourself or purchase one from a bakery.\nKnow what kind of cake the birthday person likes, and take into consideration any food allergies of the guests. Have an alternative dessert ready if they cannot have the cake.\nIf the birthday person does not want a cake, then provide what they do want! Cupcakes, brownies, pies, cookies, and ice cream are all perfectly acceptable substitutions for birthday cake.",
                "Create a back-up plan in case of weather, especially if the party is outside. Have an alternative location prepared and a system for notifying the guests if the need arises.",
                "Arrange your organized help to assist you in setting up the party on the day of. This is why you asked them to help, so make sure they are there to help you!\n\n\nSet up the decorations and food, if necessary.\nIf you are providing the food to the party venue, then be sure to get it to the venue on time.\nGive yourself enough time to set everything up. Rushing will result in mistakes.\nHave everything you need in one place, or have dedicated helpers be in charge of what supplies they are helping to provide. Know where everything is to streamline the process.",
                "Have a plan for keeping the food hot or cold, depending on what it needs.\n\n\nIf the food is being catered or provided by the restaurant, then that will be taken care of by that business.\nIf you are providing the food in your home or someone else's, then be wary of putting the food out too early. Food can spoil if it is not kept hot or cold.",
                "Notify your guests if you have to move the party to the back-up location. If you had an outdoor party planned and the weather is poor, then your guests need to know where to go instead.",
                "Be prepared for mishaps, because they will happen. Take them in stride as best you can.\n\n\nHave a dedicated cool-down area if a child gets upset during the party. It is best if it is away from the rest of the guests.\nHave a first aid kit and anything else that you think might be necessary in case someone gets injured during the party.\nIf you have pets, keep them secured away from the guests for the duration of the party. Unless your pets are very well behaved and trained, an issue could arise there, from someone being afraid of them to the pets getting loose."

When the water is simmering, place the mixing bowl inside.[1]\n\nMake sure that the water level isn't so high that you risk getting water in the mixing bowl.\nThe water should not be boiling; if it begins to get too hot, reduce the heat.",
                "Cook the icing. Put the egg whites, sugar, and corn syrup in the bowl. Stir them until they're completely combined, and continue stirring as the sugar dissolves and the mixture heats up. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of the icing; when it reaches 160 degrees, it's ready to be beaten.\n\n\nKeep a close watch on the temperature of the icing, as it could easily overcook.\nIf the icing seems quite slow to warm, increase the burner temperature. It should reach 160 degrees within 2 or so minutes.",
                "Beat the icing. Use a whisk or an electric mixer to beat the icing until it turns fluffy and glossy. Add the vanilla and continue beating for a total of five minutes. Remove the icing from heat and use it to frost your cake.",

                "Beat the icing with a spoon. As the icing cools, beat it with a spoon until it becomes thick and glossy. When it becomes difficult to move the spoon through the fudge icing, it's ready to use.\n\n\nThis icing has a loose consistency, so pour it over your cake or cupcakes rather than using a knife to frost them.\nIf the mixture seems too loose, return it to heat for a few minutes to allow it to thicken.",
                "Whip the butter. The first step is to change the consistency of the butter so that it becomes light, fluffy, and easy to mix with the other ingredients. Place it in a mixing bowl and beat the butter with a hand mixer or using a stand mixer for several minutes.[3]",

                "Stir the ingredients together. Place the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk in a bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to stir the ingredients until they are completely combined. Pour the icing over the cake, cupcakes or cookies you baked.",

        "How to Be Refined": {
            "intro": "Refined people are known for their elegance, subtlety, and social tact. If you want to be refined, then it’s not about acting like aristocracy, but about making a point of treating other people with respect while maintaining a sophisticated image. People who are refined tend to avoid bad habits, such as speaking too loudly, gossiping, or belching in public. If you want to be refined, you simply have to focus on projecting confidence, poise, and grace in your words and actions.",
            "steps": [
                "Keep it simple. You don’t need to spout of a list of facts or quote the entire Sunday paper in order to impress people with how refined you are. In fact, when it comes to being refined, less is more. You should say what’s on your mind in a succinct and clear way that leaves little up to doubt. Don’t bog your peers or strangers down in facts or in an effort to show off; instead, state your opinions briefly and confidently, and you’ll be showing that you’re a refined person who doesn’t need to ramble on to make a point.\n\n\nYou don’t need to speak in long, elaborate sentences to try to impress people. Short, concise sentences with clear words are best.\nYou also don’t need to use million-dollar words to make your points, either. It’s better if everyone can understand you.",
                "Slow down. Refined people are never in a rush because they’re sophisticated enough to give themselves time to do everything they want to do. They don’t rush to dinner, they don’t speak too fast, and they don’t rifle around their purses at top speed to find something because they already know that everything is in place. If you want to be refined, then you should work on moving in a confident, precise manner instead of moving fast, talking fast, and acting fast.\n\n\nInstead of speaking fast and saying “um” and “like” every two seconds to fill the pauses, practice talking more slowly and really thinking before you speak so you can avoid using those conversational fillers.",
                "Avoid cursing. Though refined people do get their feathers ruffled on occasion, they tend to keep their cool in public. Therefore, they avoid cursing when they get upset or saying anything untoward in the heat of the moment. In fact, they generally avoid being vulgar by mentioning sex, going to the bathroom, or any other subjects that are likely to be distasteful to some people. This doesn’t mean that refined people are boring, but that they’re just classy. Cursing is a sign of bad breeding and refined people avoid it at all costs.\n\n\nIf you do lose your cool and curse, however, just apologize.",
                "Excuse yourself if you belch or pass gas. Nobody can be refined all the time, and sometimes, our bodies betray us and make noises that make other people giggle. It’s okay if you find yourself belching after a meal or passing gas, but the best thing to do, if you want to be refined, is to politely excuse yourself instead of pretending like nothing happened. Swallow your pride and do this and you’ll be projecting refinement in no time.\n\n\nJust a simple “pardon me” before moving on is perfectly fine.",
                "Avoid slang. Though you don’t have to talk like Prince William, you should avoid using too much slang in your conversation if you want to sound refined. Avoid colloquialisms like “ya’ll” “you guys,” or “hella,” if you want to sound like a refined person who is cultured and well-mannered. Be aware of the regional phrases you use, or which terms come from pop culture, and try to find a way around them when you can. Refined people speak in a way that is timeless, not based on popular terms, such as “BFF” or “selfie.”\n\n\nOf course, if everyone around you uses a ton of slang, you don’t want to stand out completely by using proper language, but you should avoid slang as much as possible to sound refined.",
                "Avoid vulgar conversational topics. If you want to be refined, then you should avoid talking about anything that can be viewed as offensive, especially if you find yourself in mixed company. Remember that something that might go over well with your best friend may not work well in a crowd; avoid talking about sex, body parts, using the bathroom, or any statements that may be seen as offensive or off-color that relate to politics. It’s better to assume that the people around you can be easily offended than to make what you think is an innocent joke that ends up really hurting a person’s feelings. To be refined, you can still discuss interesting topics while making sure that you’re not scandalizing anyone.\n\n\nIf someone else brings up a vulgar topic that you’re not comfortable with, you can also do your best to steer the conversation in a direction that makes you feel more comfortable.",
                "Think before you speak. Refined people rarely say something that is thoughtless or offensive and don’t often find themselves apologizing for misspeaking because they’ve thought everything through. They don’t blurt out the first thing that comes to their heads and stop to ask themselves how the comment would be received and if their intentions would be clear before they said anything. Refined people literally take the time to “refine” their words before they say them, so that they are said with elegance and grace.\n\n\nBefore you say something, look at the person you’re talking to and think about whether the statement would make the person upset, or, if you’re in a large group, if the statement would be better made privately.",
                "Give compliments. You don’t have to give fake compliments you don’t believe in just to sound refined, but you should work on making people feel special when they deserve it. The art of giving a compliment is a difficult one to master, and once you learn how to compliment a person’s important traits without overstepping your bounds, you’ll be on your way to sounding even more refined than ever. Refined people also have an eye for detail and are quick to notice a new piece of jewelry or footwear that is truly worth complimenting.\n\n\nTo sound truly refined, you can say something like, “That’s the most exquisite scarf I’ve ever seen” instead of, “Oh my god, what an awesome scarf!”",
                "Don’t speak too loudly. Refined people are confident that what they say will be heard because they’ve chosen their words carefully. Speaking so loud that the person across the restaurant can hear every word you say is a sign of bad breeding, as well as a lack of respect toward others. Make sure you modulate your voice when you talk to people, and wait to grab their attention instead of speaking so loudly that they are forced to listen.\n\n\nDon’t loudly interrupt people to try to get your point across, either. Wait your turn if you want to be refined.",
                "Avoid gossiping. People who are refined have opinions, but they tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room.\n\n\nInstead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them.",
                "Be agreeable. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational.\n\n\nIf you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict.\nIf someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong.",
                "Don’t brag. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead.\n\n\nYou should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own.\nIf you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great.",
                "Keep refined company. If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are.\n\n\nThough it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships.",
                "Avoid dominating conversations. People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are.\n\n\nIf you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is.",
                "Have good manners. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners.\n\n\nBe polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it.",
                "Be cultured. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country.\n\n\nMake a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings.\nRead, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read.",
                "Be tactful. Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public.\n\n\nHave a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke.\nAvoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all.\nIf someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately.\nTactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement.",
                "Wear elegant, well-maintained clothes. Refined people take great care with their dress because they understand that an appearance of refinement is crucial to forming their refined persona. They pick clothes that are flattering, that match the season, that aren’t too revealing, and that look good together. Their clothes are tucked in, free of stains, and appropriate for the season. They tend to wear clothes with subtle colors, such as greys, browns, and blues, and don’t call too much attention to themselves with their dress.\n\n\nRefined people also tend to dress more elegant than most; men often wear suits or business casual wear even if in occasion doesn’t call for it, and refined women tend to wear dresses and heels along with tasteful jewelry.\nYour clothes don’t have to be expensive for you to look refined. You just have to make sure they fit well, match, and are free of wrinkles.\nExcessive shiny jewelry or accessories won’t make you look more refined. In fact, just one subtle watch or pair of silver earrings will do the trick and will be far better than looking flashy.\nRefined people tend to avoid graphic tee shirts or anything else that would make people laugh.",
                "Groom yourself. People who are refined take the time to comb their hair and make sure that they never look unkempt. Refined men tend to shave their faces or to maintain a very well-manicured beard. Refined people also generally look neat, clean, and like they put time and effort into their appearance. If you want to be refined, then you have to make a point of grooming yourself so that you are presentable when you step out.\n\n\nMake a habit of carrying a comb and using it in private when necessary.\nWomen can wear subtle makeup, but they should avoid going over-the-top or they won’t look very refined. Just some subtle lipstick, a bit of mascara, and some light eye shadow will do the trick.",
                "Maintain proper hygiene. If you want to be refined, then you should shower daily, wash your hair every day or at least every other day, wear deodorant (if you believe in it), and add some cologne or a light perfume into the mix if you like the effect. You should also brush your teeth at least twice a day and generally make sure that you smell nice and clean and look fresh anywhere you go. It’s hard to look refined if you have greasy hair and smell like B.O. Along with grooming yourself, maintaining proper hygiene is an important aspect of being refined.",
                "Have refined body language. Refined people know how to carry themselves. They stand up straight and maintain good posture even when they’re sitting. They keep their hands respectably folded across their legs when they sit and avoid putting their elbows on a table when they dine. They don’t slouch, fidget, or pick their noses in public. In general, they act respectful toward their own bodies as well as the people around them. To be refined, have body language that shows you have self-respect without making yourself too much at home anywhere you go.\n\n\nAvoid sitting with your legs spread wide, because this can be seen as a bit vulgar.\nAvoid scratching yourself in public. If you have an itch you really have to scratch, you’ll be better off scratching it in the bathroom.\nWhen you talk to people, stand at a respectable distance away from them. Close-talkers tend not to be refined.",
                "Smile and make eye contact. You may have an image of a refined person as a snob who would sooner turn his nose up at a new person than smile or make eye contact, but people who are truly refined know that other people deserve to be treated with respect. Making eye contact with people and smiling when you meet them or approach them is a common courtesy and shows them that you look at them as individuals who are worthy of your time. Eye contact also shows people that you have their attention, which is very respectful and refined.\n\n\nAvoid checking your phone or texting when you’re talking to people and focus on the eye contact instead. Not paying attention to people is not very refined.",
                "Greet people in a refined manner. If you want to be refined, then you should treat people with respect when they come up to you. Don’t be too lazy to stand up to shake the hand of a new acquaintance or to introduce yourself by name. If a person you already know is approaching, it’s still polite to stand to greet that person if you want to be refined. If you just lift a hand and say, “hey,” then you may be seen as being a bit socially lazy, which is a sign of a lack of refinement.\n\n\nIt’s also polite to repeat the person’s name if you meet him or her for the first time. You can say something like, “It’s great to finally meet you, Jason.”"

        "wikiHow to Gain Muscle Mass as a Vegan": {
            "intro": "Despite many misconceptions, you can be a vegan and gain muscle mass. Plant-based foods offer enough protein to help you achieve your goals, as long as you are eating a varied diet. To gain muscle mass, you need to know what your body needs to build muscle, and you need to have a healthy body overall. You also need to practice weightlifting to slowly strengthen and grow your muscles.",
            "steps": [
                "Get your protein. Muscles need protein to repair and build themselves. The amino acids in protein are what the body uses to perform these tasks. Therefore, your body needs protein to build muscle over time.[1] As a vegan, protein will come from plant-based sources. Remember that many foods contain protein, not just animal products.",
                "Calculate the amount of protein you need. If you're trying to bulk up, you really do not need that much more protein than an average person. An average person needs 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. So if you weigh 120 pounds (54.4 kg), you need 43.5 grams of protein per day.[2]\n\nA casual exerciser, on the other hand, needs 0.5 to 0.9 grams per kilogram of protein per day. So the same 120 pound person would need 27.2 to 49 grams of protein per day. People who lift professionally have even higher protein needs.[3]\n\nAlways talk to your doctor or dietitian about the right amount of protein for you per day.\nIt may be tempting to eat large amounts of protein to build muscle. However, your body does not need the extra protein. That is, it takes any extra protein and stores it as fat, which means that taking in more protein does not help you achieve your goal.[4]",
                "Eat enough calories. If you are becoming serious about weightlifting, your body will need extra calories to gain the weight you need to build muscles. For instance, a male weightlifter who's just beginning needs about 18 calories per pound of body weight. So if you weigh 120 pounds, you need to eat at least 2,160 calories a day.[5]\n\nBe sure that your calories aren't coming solely from carbohydrates. This is very hard with a vegan diet as so many foods that vegans lean towards are carbohydrate-heavy.",
                "Get complete proteins. That is, most plant-based proteins are only partial proteins, unlike meat and eggs. They do not contain all the amino acids needed to build muscles. However, when you combine proteins by switching what you eat during the day and adding variety, you can create complete proteins.[6]\n\nFor instance, wheat and rice do not have as much lysine, one amino acid, as other vegetable proteins, such as beans and peas. Where wheat and rice shine, though, is in methionine, another amino acid, which beans and peas do not have as much of. The point is to balance different types of vegetable proteins, such as eating both grains and and legumes some time during the day, to make sure you are getting the needed amino acids. Nut proteins can also help you balance your amino acids.[7]",
                "Use carbohydrates to your advantage. Carbohydrates give you energy so you can workout. In fact, you need about 1,200 calories of a 2,000 calorie diet to come from carbohydrates. They key is to stick with complex carbs, such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.[8] While limiting carbohydrates is hard on a vegan diet, choosing the right type of carbohydrates is beneficial.",
                "Research how much protein is in your food. As a vegan, you do have a number of options open to you for protein. For instance, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter has 4.5 grams of protein, while 1/2 a cup of legumes has 9 grams of protein. A full cup of grains has 6 grams of protein.[9]\n\nA cup of beans has as much as 15 grams of protein.[10]",
                "Eat your greens. Dark, leafy greens, such as kale or turnip greens, contain large amounts of calcium, an essential nutrient to keep your bones strong and healthy.[11]\n\nThe government recommends you get 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day.[12] A cup of raw kale has 137 milligrams of calcium.[13]",
                "Get your vitamin B-12. Vitamin B-12 is important in maintaining healthy blood cells. It will also help keep the iron up in your blood. If you become anemic, you may not have the strength to lift weights.[14]\n\nIn the same vein, it's important to get enough iron in your diet to keep you from being anemic. Iron is in peas and lentils, as well as dark, leafy greens. One of the best ways to get both iron and vitamin B-12 is through enriched cereals.[15] You'll also find vitamin B-12 in nutritional yeast.[16]\n\nThe government recommends you get 6 micrograms of vitamin B-12 daily and 18 milligrams of iron per day.[17] Most enriched cereals more than cover your vitamin B-12 needs in a single serving, some having as much as 28 micrograms per serving. Read the labels to make sure you are getting enough.[18] A cup of lentils (already cooked) will provide you with 37 percent of your daily value of iron.[19]",
                "Eat sources rich in zinc. Zinc helps keep your body healthy. Therefore, it's important to get enough in your diet so that you can continue to build muscle mass.\n\n\nBeans, enriched cereals, and pumpkin seeds are a great way to get enough zinc in your diet.\nYou should get at least 15 milligrams of zinc per day.[20] To put this amount in perspective, you get 2.57 milligrams of zinc from 1/4 of cup of pumpkin seeds.[21]\n\nAfter testing your zinc blood levels, you may find that a zinc supplement would benefit you.",
                "Find sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids help keep you heart in good shape, your body's most important muscle.[22]\n\nFor vegans, the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids are flaxseed, walnuts, and soybeans. Certain oils are also good sources, such as canola and soy.[23]\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating sources of omega-3 fatty acids at least twice a week.[24]",
                "Lift 3 times a week. While you may think you need to lift everyday to build up your muscles, you really need to only lift 2 or 3 times a week for 30 minutes each time.[25]\n\nIn fact, the vegan diet may better sustain this type of workout method, rather than a long daily workout, as it allows more time for recovery.[26]",
                "Trade off which body part you work. Don't work the same body parts everyday. Pick a day for each group, so that you are slowing building up each set. For instance, you could work on your front upper body one day, your back and buttocks the next workout, and you lower half at your next workout.[27] Another strategy would be to do a full-body workout 3x/week so that all muscle groups are being hit 3x/week versus 1x/week. This is helpful if you are following a vegan diet because muscle retention/building is so important to overall health.\n\n\nOne exercise you could try for your front upper body is the barbell bench press. Lay down with your back to a bench. Lift the barbell up over your body with your arms almost locked. Have someone spot for you if you haven't done this exercise before. Lower the bar towards your chest, and then hold it for a brief second. Extend your arms back up, lifting the bar. Breathe in as you bring it back down, and breath out as you push it back up. Repeat 6 to 8 times until you begin to feel the strain, then set the bar up to take a short break.[28]\n\nFor your back and biceps, try a wide-grip lat pulldown. Once sitting on the bench, make sure your knees are up against the knee bar. Grab the bar from above. Push your chest out, and lean back a little. Pull the bar down using only your arms. Breathe out as you slowly bring the bar back up. Breathe in as you pull it back down. Repeat until you feel it in your muscles, and then take a break.[29]\n\nFor your legs, use a barbell squat. With the barbell at the correct height on a rack, center the bar on the back of your neck across your shoulders. Move away from the rack with the barbell on your shoulders with your feet shoulder-width apart. Squat down with the barbell still on your shoulders, as if you are sitting in a chair. Breathe in as you squat down. Try to keep your back straight. You should stop lowering yourself once your thighs are parallel to the floor. Breathe out and push yourself back up. Repeat 6 to 8 times, then place the barbell back on the rack for a break.[30]",
                "Ask for help. If you're new to strength training, use the help available to you at your gym. Many gyms have trainers to help you learn how to properly use equipment, including weights. If you don't learn proper technique, you could injure yourself.[31]\n\nYour trainer will work with you to learn techniques such as warming up (doing 5 minutes of aerobic exercise before lifting), keeping your body in proper alignment, increasing the weight you lift slowly, and learning to breathe properly while lifting.[32]",
                "Feel for the burn. That is, you are trying to work certain muscles at a time. If it seems too easy and you don't feel anything while lifting, you may need to adjust the way you're lifting.[33]\n\nDon't automatically switch to a higher weight. You don't want to strain your muscles by adding on too much weight too quickly.[34]",
                "Know when to stop. If you feel sudden pains or strains in your joints, you should stop that exercise. It's ok for the muscle to have slight burning, but you can injure your joints if you don't pay attention to them while lifting.[35]"

        "How to Get Started in Woodworking": {
            "intro": "Woodworking can be an enjoyable hobby that allows you to express yourself creatively and work with your hands. Furthermore, wood can be cut and shaped using simple, affordable tools, making this a relatively low-investment hobby. Whether you are looking to build furniture, tackle some home improvement projects, or build smaller objects like jewelry boxes, learning how to get started in woodworking requires only a few tools and resources.",
            "steps": [
                "Collect some tools for measuring and marking projects. Before making any cuts, most woodworking projects will require you to make measurements and mark out your cuts on the wood. Essential tools for these tasks are a tape measure, a carpenter's pencil, and a combination square.",
                "Acquire tools for cutting wood. Of course, making cuts in wood is the backbone of woodworking. A handheld circular saw is an essential power tool for making straight cuts, while a jigsaw is ideal for making rounded cuts. A handheld backsaw provides a cheap and quiet alternative to these power tools.",
                "Purchase a few tools for shaping wood. To create woodworking projects with elegant, finished appearances, you'll often want to shape the wood by creating beveled edges or intricate molding. Crucial tools for shaping wood include a block plane, which will allow you to create basic beveled edges, and a router, which can be fitted with a variety of bits allowing for more intricate patterns.",
                "Use tools for putting your wood projects together. Screws, nails, and glue are the go-to choices for assembling your woodworking projects. A cordless drill is essential for drilling holes, while a screwdriver, hammer, and clamps are also very useful. (For your first clamp try a one-handed bar clamp so you don't have to take both hands off the project.)",
                "Learn to create a glued or screwed butt joint. When joining wood, the most straightforward approach is the butt joint, in which you simply butt the end grain of one panel against the side of another. This joint can be secured with glue for a clean appearance, or with screws for a sturdier, if less attractive finish.",
                "Use a biscuit joiner for strong, attractive joints. A biscuit joiner is a power tool that cuts a narrow groove into the end of each piece of wood to be joined. You can then fit small wood chips called \"biscuits\" into these grooves, which gives you extra stability for a glued joint.",
                "Create grooved joints for extra surface area. Another way to increase the surface area for the glue to adhere to is by cutting a groove into one piece of wood. These grooves allow the second piece of wood to contact the first piece along multiple surfaces. Rabbits, dadoes, and grooves are 3 types of this joint, so named based on the orientation of the cut to the wood's grain.",
                "Explore traditional woodworking joints for extra beauty. Of course, the 2 quintessential woodworking joints are the dovetail and the mortise and tenon, in which the 2 wood pieces interlock with each other. These joints take much more careful cutting to create, but are unrivaled in their elegance and strength.",
                "Learn the basic oil and wax finish. The most error-proof way to finish wood projects is by applying boiled linseed oil and furniture wax. These finishes can be applied with cotton rags, and thus eliminate any danger of leaving brush strokes or other defects.",
                "Seal woodworking projects with polyurethane for durability. For surfaces that take more abuse, like a dining room table, you'll want a finish that cures to a hard, protective layer. Polyurethane is the standard product for this type of finish, and can be applied using a foam brush or a high-quality bristle brush.",
                "Experiment with other wood finishes as desired. Of course, there are plenty of other ways to finish wood, each with their own advantages, drawbacks, and appearances. Wood stains, paints, lacquers, varnishes, teak oil, and Danish oil are all common options for creating durable, attractive finishes in your woodworking projects."

        "wikiHow to Prevent Emotional Abuse": {
            "intro": "Emotional abuse can take a variety of forms, from humiliating jokes to degrading comments, and it's not always easy to spot. It is important to recognize the signs, and remove emotionally abusive behaviors from your relationship.",
            "steps": [
                "Notice common forms of emotional abuse. Not all abuse happens to the same degree, or in the same way. However, there are a few clusters of behavior that usually constitute emotional abuse, including:[1]\n\nHumiliation, invalidation and criticism: You feel like you're constantly being put-down, judged, or told that you're being too sensitive.\nDomination, control and shame: You feel infantilized, and you find yourself asking \"permission\" to engage in regular activities.\nDenial and unreasonable demands: The other person cannot accept blame or apologize, and he or she consistently denies or embellishes facts.\nIsolation and neglect: You're subjected to the \"silent treatment,\" and denied affection or attention as punishment.\nCodependence: Your personal boundaries are consistently violated, and the other person relies on you as their sole emotional support.",
                "Be aware of gaslighting. Gaslighting is the slow process of being led question your own sanity or reality. It's a particularly subtle form of emotional abuse, but it can have extremely damaging consequences. You might be suffering from gaslighting if:[2]\n\nYou constantly second-guess yourself.\nYou're always apologizing, even for insignificant or non-existent errors.\nYou know something is terribly wrong, but you can't put your finger on it.\nYou struggle to make simple choices.\nYou find yourself wondering if you're too sensitive.",
                "Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of a healthy relationship. It can be difficult to recognize abuse if you have no idea what a positive relationship looks like. If you feel like you're missing out on the majority of these things, though, you might consider the possibility that you're being emotionally abused:[3]\n\nGood will and emotional support\nThe right to your own feelings and opinions, even if they differ from the other person's\nEncouragement of your interests and accomplishments\nA lack of physical or emotional threats, including angry outbursts\nRespectful language that steers clear of name-calling or put-downs",
                "Bring up the problem in a calm environment. Throwing down an accusation of emotional abuse in the midst of a heated argument — even if your claim is perfectly legitimate — is a recipe for disaster. Instead, consider these less confrontational alternatives:\n\n\nAsk the other person if you can have a calm discussion. Instead of bringing up the term \"emotional abuse,\" say that you think there are things that both of you could work on to make your relationship better. Use plenty of \"I\" language, such as \"I feel like I'm being infantilized when I have to ask permission to go out,\" instead of hurling accusations that start with \"you.\"\nWrite a letter. If you feel like a reasonable, relaxed talk is out of the question, put your concerns to paper. The benefit to this method is you can make sure that you're saying exactly what you mean in a way that's constructive as possible. Write out a few drafts, and try to avoid directly accusatory statements that will ignite the other person's anger. For example, instead of saying \"You make fun of me and I hate it,\" try \"I feel like I'm being mocked and humiliated.\"",
                "Ask for support. Having a trusted friend or family member weigh in on the situation can help you feel like you're evaluating it objectively, as well as validating your feelings. Additionally, if the emotionally abusive relationship breaks down completely, it'll be nice to have someone to lean on as you transition out of it.\n\n\nDon't choose a mutual friend. Someone who feels obligated to the other person in the emotionally abusive relationship is not a good choice for this role. Instead, try to confide in someone you know well, but who doesn't have any particular obligation to your abuser.\nAvoid the pit of despair. It's absolutely legitimate to vent to a close friend when you're having a tough time, but don't make that the sole focus of your relationship. Otherwise, this person will think you're just using them to complain, and you'll have another toxic relationship on your hands. When you feel like you've crossed the line between venting and wallowing, shift your attention to something more uplifting.",
                "Seek professional help. If the situation has escalated to the point that you can't address it by yourself, contact a licensed mental health professional. Find a therapist or counselor that specializes in emotional abuse, and make an appointment as soon as possible.\n\n\nIf money is a concern, look up state-administered mental health services available in your county. Or, if you're a university student, contact the student health center.\nWhether or not you want to save the relationship, it's important to see a professional. If your abuser isn't interested in participating, then you can simply focus on healing your own wounds and moving forward.\nIf you feel like you're in a dangerous situation, leave the abuser's environment immediately. Stay with a friend or family member, or contact a local abuse shelter.",
                "Break the cycle. As you move forward, avoid repeating the behaviors that were so prevalent in the emotionally abusive relationship.\n\n\nBe wary of allowing yourself to be abused by someone else. If you find yourself falling into the same victim-like patterns, stop immediately.\nDon't adopt the actions of your abuser. You might find yourself needing to exert power and dominance over other people so that you don't feel victimized, but resist."

        "How to Dissolve Kidney Stones": {
            "intro": "Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand or larger than a pearl. They form as a result of an excess of minerals or other deposits in the kidneys, and they can become lodged in the ureters, the bladder or the urethra. They're notorious for being painful to pass, especially when they block the flow of urine. In many cases your doctor might send you home with the advice to consume extra fluids until the stone passes. Bigger stones can be pulverized using medical technology, breaking them into small bits so they can flow through your system.",
            "steps": [
                "Look into medication. If you have trouble passing small stones on your own, your doctor may prescribe a type of medication called an alpha blocker, which relaxes the muscles in your ureter to help you pass the stones more easily. This should be sufficient for smaller stones, but you may need extra help to pass larger ones.[1]\n\nIf you have uric acid kidney stones, then a course of potassium citrate might be in order so that the stones dissolve on their own.[2]",
                "Get extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). This procedure uses sound waves to break up large stones, making them easier to pass. Since the procedure can be painful, patients are usually placed under anesthesia during the 30 to 45 minute process of pulverizing the stones. This is an effective treatment, but it can cause bruising and pain as the small pieces of stone eventually pass.",
                "See if the stone can be removed with a ureteroscope. Stones that are too large to be broken up with shock wave therapy, but too small to require surgery may be removed with a scope that is inserted into the ureter. Once the stone is located, it is broken up using small tools. Since the procedure can be painful, it usually requires either local or general anesthesia.",
                "Have percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery. For large stones that can't be broken into bits using shock wave therapy, surgery may be required to remove them. A small incision is made in the patient's back, and a tiny instrument is inserted to remove the kidney stone or stones. The surgery requires an overnight stay in the hospital.[3]",
                "See if thyroid treatment is necessary. In some cases, calcium kidney stones are caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. This can happen when a small tumor grows on a parathyroid gland, or when a separate condition causes the parathyroid to overproduce parathyroid hormone. Once your doctor has determined the cause of the hyperparathyroidism, he or she will recommend the proper course of treatment to correct the problem.",
                "Drink several quarts of water every day. No matter what type of stone you have, kidney stones smaller than 5 millimeters will usually pass on their own, without the need for medical intervention. If you can feel your kidney stone but it isn't painful enough to require treatment, your doctor will probably advise drinking 2 to 3 quarts of water daily until the stone passes.[4] Staying extremely well hydrated will help flush the kidney stone from your system.\n\n\nAim to drink enough water to produce mostly clear urine. Clear urine is an indication that your body is extremely well hydrated.\nNon-caffeinated, sugar and alcohol free beverages like ginger ale, fruit juice, cranberry juice, or green tea could also help you stay hydrated. Avoid beverages with caffeine, artificial sweeteners, sugar, or alcohol while you're trying to pass a kidney stone.",
                "Make dietary changes to shrink stones. Since kidney stones are caused by the buildup of certain minerals, eating fewer foods containing these minerals can help to shrink the stones. This is especially effective if you have either calcium or uric acid stones.\n\n\n\nIf you have calcium stones, cut back on the following foods that make the problem worse: salty foods, dairy products, oysters, tofu, and fatty foods.[5] If you have calcium oxalate stones, you should avoid foods high in oxalate, like rhubarb, grapes, spinach, sweet potatoes, coffee, and chocolate.\n\nIf you have uric acid stones, cut back on the following foods containing uric acid: organ meat like liver and kidney, anchovies, sardines, beans, mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower, yeast, and alcohol.",
                "Drink beverages containing lemons every day. Whether you drink real lemonade, lemon juice, lemon-lime drinks or just water with a few lemon slices, the acidic nature of citrus helps so that kidney stones do not form.[6]",
                "Try herbal remedies. While no herbal remedy has been scientifically proven to remove kidney stones, many have found that consuming certain herbs, especially in the form of tea, can help to shrink the stones so they pass more easily. Try the following herbs in order to treat a mild kidney stone:\n\n\nBirch leaf tea, which is said to help remove waste products from the urinary system.[7]\n\nBlack tea, which increases urine flow since it is a diuretic.[8]\n\nNettle leaf, which is also a diuretic and can help flush the kidney stones from your system.\nDandelion root, which is said is to be an effective kidney tonic.\nApple cider vinegar, which is said to help dissolve stones. You can consume 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of apple cider vinegar each day, or mix it with water.\n\nAvoid using sorrel, which can cause calcium oxalate kidney stones to worsen.\nBanana stem juice is a well-known treatment for kidney stones in India.",
                "Determine if you really have a kidney stone. While not all kidney stones cause people to have symptoms, even very small stones can cause severe pain. If you've already had a few kidney stones in your life, you might be reasonably sure that's what's going on. However, since the symptoms of a kidney stone overlap symptoms of many other disorders, it's a good idea to receive a diagnosis so you can treat it properly. Here are the most common symptoms of kidney stones:[9]\n\nSevere pain in the side and lower back, which often spreads to the abdomen and groin.\nPain that comes and goes in waves, and is present during urination.\nFoul-smelling, cloudy, pink or brown urine.\nNausea and vomiting.",
                "Visit a doctor to get an imaging test. Getting an x-ray, CT scan or ultrasound (depending on what your doctor recommends) when you notice the symptoms of a kidney stone is the best way to determine how you should treat the stone. Imaging technology can will reveal the size, shape and number of stones you're dealing with.\n\n\nIf you have a stone smaller than 5 millimeters, your doctor will probably advise using at-home methods to help the stone pass.\nIf you have a larger stone or multiple stones, your doctor may prescribe a medication or recommend a different course of medical treatment to pulverize the stones so you can pass them.",
                "Figure out what kind of stones you have. Kidney stones produce the same symptoms, but they can be caused by several different conditions. Knowing what's causing the formation of your kidney stones will help you reduce their size and prevent them in the future. Your doctor may perform blood or urine tests to figure out what type of stones you have. After you pass a stone, your doctor might send it to a lab for analysis to determine its makeup. Here are the different types of kidney stones:\n\n\n\nCalcium stones: these are the most common type of stones, and are caused by a high level of calcium combined with another substance, such as oxalate or uric acid. Doctors may prescribe a thiazide diuretic or phosphate containing preparation in order to get rid of these stones.\n\nUric acid stones: these form when the urine contains too much acid. Doctors will prescribe allopurinol, which may help dissolve the kidney stone. Also, they may prescribe potassium citrate to lower the pH of the urine and dissolve the uric acid stone.\n\nStruvite stones: these can form after a urinary tract infection. To prevent struvite stones, your doctor might suggest that you keep your urinary tract clean and free of infections.\n\nCystine stones: this type of stone is caused by a rare genetic disease. These are more difficult to treat. Your doctor may have your drink more fluids or prescribe you medication that reduces the amount of cystine in the urine.[10]"

        "wikiHow to Take Male Model Portfolio Pictures": {
            "intro": "Getting into modeling is tough, but it is impossible without great portfolio pictures. Whether you're the photographer or the model, getting good photos is not hard -- all you need is decent lighting, a calm demeanor, and a willingness to ham it up a bit for the camera.",
            "steps": [
                "Shoot outdoors unless you have a near-professionally lit indoor space. You will save yourself 100's of headaches if you just shoot outside, aiming for the 1.5 hours after sunrise or before sunset. This is known as the \"golden hour,\" when sunlight naturally diffuses through the atmosphere for soft, appealing shadows and well-rounded lighting.\n\n\nOvercast days are great shooting days, as they provide naturally soft lighting as well. You should still avoid shooting from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM, when the sun is directly overhead, however.\nIf you do have to shoot inside, turn on every light and open every window. The more light, the better.[1]",
                "Choose a bland, basic background. A great scene or setting in the back simply distracts from your model. A modeling agency doesn't care about the setting of the photo, they care who is in it. A plainly colored wall that the subjects \"pops\" from is your only concern.\n\n\nDon't match the model with the background. A black man shouldn't be on a dark brown background, and a woman in a bright dress shouldn't be flush against a yellow wall. You want contrast.\nWhen taking photos, leave the background out of focus, making the model pop out even more.",
                "Ensure your model is evenly lit, without any dramatic shadows. While a hard shadow looks great in a regular photo, the fact is modeling agencies need to see as much of the model's body as possible.While you want some shadows for definition, you need to aim for clarity above all.\n\n\nPay careful attention to the face, particularly the eye sockets, for dark or distracting shadows. A reflective bounce or weak light on the face can usually eliminate any issues.",
                "Do your best to make the model comfortable, happy, and willing to play. Taking modeling photos is a creative endeavor, and it should be a lot of fun. This isn't just to have a good time -- a happy model is a relaxed one, and relaxed models always look better on camera. The best way to do this is talk -- find out what kind of shots they want, their general personality, and the type of modeling they're interested in.\n\n\nDon't feel bad about \"taking control.\" People, especially on camera, want to be told what looks good. So move the model around, make them smile, and give direction.[2]",
                "Make sure you cover the three \"essential\" photos before you start getting creative. The following are your can't-miss shots: the three images you must have good copies of in order to get the bare minimum. Luckily, they are simple, easy shots to set up, and you've seen countless examples of them in ads and magazines.\n\n\n\nFull Body: Simple and easy, you capture the model from head to toe. Good posture, is key, as is shooting slightly from below the subject -- it makes them seem bigger and more manly.\n\nHalf-length: From the mid-thigh up. Hands can be up, in pockets, or out. Again, shoot from below for the best results.\n\nWaist Up: Particularly necessary for shirtless models, this cuts right at the hip. If shirtless, make sure that no fabric is showing. Again, a lower angle makes everyone look hotter.[3]",
                "Always retouch photos before sending them back to the model. Even if you're not particularly practiced as a photo editor, you should still take a little time to work on the photos before sending them. It doesn't matter what program you're using, you should, at least, take a look at:\n\n\n\nCrop: Crop the image so that model takes up most of the frame, and isn't cut off in any way. You want the shot to be pretty tight like it was a full-page magazine ad\n\nBrightness & Contrast: Make sure the darkest parts of the picture (there shouldn't be many) are a nice deep black, and there are no nasty, bright white glares.\n\nHue Saturation: This changes some basic color settings. It can be useful for balancing images. For example, if there is a distracting red glow coming off a red dress, you can lower the saturation of the \"red\" slider to faintly tone the reds in the image down. You can also boost overall saturation to add some more color \"pop\" into the picture.\n\nClarity: Usually offered on only higher-end programs, this catch-all setting for sharpness and image quality is useful when bumped up 8-12. Don't go above 20.[4]",
                "Send the model the retouched shots for approval. To go the extra mile, send them copies of each shot in black and white as well (which may require a retouch of Brightness & Contrast), so that they have the option to use either. Ask them if there were any other shots they liked, or if they have any comments on these. From here, you can always re-shoot, re-edit, or send off the shots to an agency.\n\n\nMost agencies want prints, usually 8.5 x 11\". More and more agencies, however, are converting to all digital submission processes.",
                "Know the three elements you want to highlight for successful pictures. Modeling agencies are interested in three things -- face, body, and confidence. If you can cover these in your pictures, you'll give them the full impression of you as a model.\n\n\nYour face structure and shape.\nYour physique (muscles etc.) and how your body is built.\nIf you got \"it\". You have to be self-confident and able to show it. Have no fear of showing your body and have the right look in your eyes.",
                "Pick out 3-4 varied, well-fitting outfits for the type of modeling you want to accomplish. If you don't want to model swimwear, then don't wear a swimsuit! If your best feature is your body, don't wear clothes that cover everything up! There are tons of types of modeling out there, so think about what you want to do and are best suited for, then dress accordingly. Have multiple outfits so that you can capture many looks when shooting easily.\n\n\nThe fit of your clothing is the most important thing. If a shirt is really cool, but a size too big, don't wear it -- you'll lose too much body definition.\nWhen in doubt, going one size smaller than normal is usually your best bet, as it stays trim and form-fitting.\nCommunicate with your photographer ahead of time if they want any particular looks, outfits, or ideas.",
                "Focus on loose, confident posture, no matter what pose you're in. A model must exude sexuality and confidence, no matter what their position. While the rules of good posture still apply to models -- back straight, chin up, shoulders back, hips over ankles[5] -- they may not always apply based on the pose you have to hold.\n\n\nTake a deep breath and relax your muscles. Don't forget to focus on the muscles around your eyes, mouth, and jaw, which make you look tense when clenched.\nKeep your shoulders back. This naturally expands your chest, making you look bigger and more manly.\nAvoid looking straight at the camera, which often makes your jawline disappear.[6]",
                "Take different photos to show both the serious and playful sides of yourself. A model lives in front of the camera, so now is not the time to be shy. Remember to capture a range of emotions while shooting, even if you don't plan on using them all. A modeling portfolio needs to capture a range of \"characters\" that could be fit into any type of ad, so don't pick one look and stick with it exclusively. Have some fun and start making faces. Some to consider include:\n\n\nA close-mouthed, serious look\nOpen and close-mouthed smiles\nLaughter\nAnger, intensity, or fierceness\nThoughtful or pensive\nRomantic or sensual.[7]",
                "Stay \"in character\" the whole time. Once you're on camera, act like the thing is shooting pictures every single second. Photographers often take 3-4 shots a second, and if you are always cracking a sheepish smile, looking away, or changing poses, you'll make it impossible to get a good shot. Make your shots slow and deliberate, and try not to \"break\" because you feel self-conscience or embarrassed.\n\n\nRemember -- the point isn't to get 100 good pictures, it is to get 10-12 really great ones. So be patient and take your time with each pose, face, or shot.[8]",
                "Work constructively with your photographer. If you have an idea for a pose or a shot, let the photographer know. But you should also trust them and let them guide you -- they are the ones with the lens, after all. Let them, for lack of better word, \"model\" you. When reviewing photos, always temper any criticism with positivity or helpful suggestions. Remember that most models are their own worst critic, and complaining that you \"look terrible\" or \"ugly\" in all of the shots is a subtle insult to your photographer, as well. It makes it much less likely they'll really sacrifice a lot more energy to help get better photos.[9]\n\nIf you review the photos after the shoot and don't like any, say something! You've got to work together to find a few you like.",
                "Limit your portfolio to your very best 12-16 pictures. You can even have a few less if it means cutting a few of questionable quality. You do not need to send a ton of pictures to impressive someone at an agency, especially if you're just getting started and haven't gotten any work yet. Instead, you need to focus on quality -- even two incredible shots (one of your head, one of your body) are really all you need to convince someone.\n\n\nIf a shot is on the fence, don't include it. Only submit the very best you have if you want the best jobs.[10]"

        "wikiHow to Cure Stomach Cramps": {
            "intro": "Stomach cramps are extremely painful, but it's possible to relieve them by treating the underlying cause, which you may even be able to do at home. Possible causes of stomach cramps can come from your digestive organs, aorta, appendix, kidneys, gallbladder, or spleen. They can also originate from an infection elsewhere in your body.[1] Cramps are commonplace for some women during their menstrual cycle, although exercises can often alleviate such pain. The strength of pain does not always necessarily indicate seriousness: very painful cramps can be caused by gas passing through your digestive system harmlessly, whereas life-threatening conditions such as colon cancer and early appendicitis can produce mild or even no pain.[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Look for signs of heartburn and/or indigestion. Although heartburn and indigestion are different, indigestion can lead to heartburn. Indigestion, or dyspepsia, is mild discomfort in the upper part of your abdomen that is usually accompanied by a feeling of fullness.[3] Heartburn, on the other hand, is a painful, burning feeling just below or behind the breastbone.[4] This is caused by a “reflux” of stomach acid and food into the esophagus (the muscular tube that leads to your stomach).\n\n\nAdditional signs that you have heartburn or indigestion include fullness and discomfort after eating and/or a burning sensation below the breastbone generally after eating.",
                "Make lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes can help prevent and resolve heartburn and indigestion. Some lifestyle changes that you can make include:[5][6]\n\nDecreasing your alcohol and caffeine intake\nEating less spicy, fatty, or greasy foods\nEating small, frequent meals instead of large meals\nEating slower and not eating right before bedtime\nRaising the head of your bed if you experience heartburn during the night\nReducing your stress level\nRegular exercise\nSmoking cessation\nLosing some weight if you are overweight\nAvoiding aspirin or NSAIDs. If you must take them, take them with food.",
                "Take antacids. Over-the-counter antacids or acid blockers can help relieve heartburn and indigestion. Many different forms are available on the market, and they include:[7][8]\n\nAntacids, such as TUMS, are good for short-term relief. These neutralize the acid in your stomach.\nH2 blockers, such as Zantac or Pepcid, block the production of stomach acid and last a few hours.\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including Prilosec and Omeprazole, also block production of stomach acid and help relieve the symptoms of and prevent frequent heartburn. PPIs are used long term.\nSome of these antacids can have side effects such as constipation or diarrhea. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor to choose the best one for you.",
                "Try herbal/natural remedies. If you prefer herbal remedies, alternative medication may help relieve heartburn or indigestion. Some herbal remedies include:\n\n\nChamomile: There is some evidence that shows chamomile in combination with other herbs may be good for an upset stomach.[9] Do not use chamomile if you take anticoagulants, as it interferes with these medications.\nPeppermint Oil: Enteric coated peppermint oil capsules can be used for irritable bowel syndrome. There are some studies that peppermint oil with caraway oil can also help with indigestion.[10]\n\nDeglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL): Licorice root, in preliminary studies, has been shown to help with digestion and heartburn. It can, however, cause an increase in blood pressure.[11]",
                "Identify if you have gas. Often, gas can cause stomach pain and a bloated feeling. Signs that you are experiencing gas include frequent belching or burping and flatulence. Gas can also cause abdominal cramps, as well as a tightness or knotted feeling in your abdomen.[12]",
                "Make lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes can help resolve and prevent and gas. Some lifestyle changes that you can make include:[13][14]\n\nDrinking more water and less carbonated or fizzy drinks\nAvoiding vegetables that cause more gas, such as legumes, broccoli, and cabbage\nAvoiding high-fat foods\nEating slower to avoid swallowing air",
                "Look for food intolerances. Cut out certain foods to see if intolerance of those foods is the cause. For example, milk and dairy products may cause cramps and stomach pain in people who are lactose intolerant.[15]",
                "Take an over-the-counter remedy. OTC products with simethicone help make it easier to belch away gas. Digestive enzymes may be useful if you are lactose intolerant. A digestive aid, such as Beano, can help digest beans and vegetables.[16]",
                "Consider if constipation is another symptom. Constipation can also cause stomach pain. Signs of constipation include having bowel movements less than three times a week, trouble passing stool, or hard and dry stool.[17]",
                "Make lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes can help resolve and prevent constipation. Some lifestyle changes that you can make include:[18][19]\n\nAdding more fiber to your diet. Fruits, vegetables, and grains are high in fiber.\nDrinking a lot of water (at least 8 – 13 glasses daily)\nExercising regularly",
                "Take an effective medication. There are many OTC laxatives and fiber supplements; however, many laxatives may have side effects. Choosing the appropriate one may help relieve constipation. It is important to note that laxatives are not for long-term use.[20]\n\nLubricants, such as mineral oil, make it easier for stool to pass.\nStool softeners, such as docusate, soften the stool. This is good for patients who are on medications that cause constipation.\nBulk-forming laxatives, including psyllium, add bulk to the stool.\nStimulant laxatives, such as bisacodyl, cause contraction of the muscles of the intestinal wall helping to push the stool; however, long-term use can cause damage to your intestinal wall.\nOsmotic laxatives, like saline laxatives or polyethylene glycol, cause water to be drawn into your GI tract, making it easier for stool to pass. These may cause electrolyte imbalances.\nFiber supplements, like Metamucil, help absorb water and maintain regularity.",
                "Try an herbal remedy. Alternative medications may help relieve constipation. Flaxseed is the most common herbal remedy. It has soluble fiber that can help with constipation.[21]",
                "Look for a correlation between cramping and your period. Menstrual cramps in the lower abdomen are experienced by women usually just before and/or during their periods. Sometimes they can be serious and indicate endometriosis or uterine fibroids.",
                "Make lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes that can help relieve menstrual cramps include exercise, stress management, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol. In addition, studies have shown that vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1 (thiamine), vitamin B-6, and magnesium supplements may reduce menstrual cramps.[22]",
                "Take a medication. Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, at regular doses starting the day before you get your period may help if your cramps are predictable. You can continue taking the medicine as directed by your doctor for two to three days or until your symptoms go away. If your cramps are severe, your doctor can also prescribe birth control, which can reduce the severity of your cramps.[23]",
                "Try herbal alternatives. Some studies have found that acupuncture (inserting thin needles through your skin at strategic points) helps relieve menstrual cramps. In addition some herbs such as fennel may help with the cramps as well.[24]",
                "Look for other flu-like symptoms. Gastroenteritis, or the “stomach bug,” can cause severe stomach pain. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever generally accompany this.[25]",
                "Stay hydrated. Dehydration is the most common issue with gastroenteritis, so drink a lot of liquids such as water and diluted sports drinks (undiluted, sports drinks contain too much sugar. Try cutting them by adding more water.). Take them in frequent sips.[26]\n\nSigns of dehydration include dark urine, dizziness, muscle cramps, fatigue, and dry mouth. Get medical help if you cannot keep down liquids.[27]",
                "Let your stomach settle. In addition to stomach cramps, vomiting and nausea are associated with gastroenteritis. Let your stomach settle then slowly begin to eat easy-to-digest and bland foods. Foods such crackers, toast, bananas, and rice are generally easy to digest. Avoid spicy and fatty food, dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol for a few days.[28]",
                "Get plenty of rest. Getting rest is important to be able to recover quickly. Rest helps promote your immune system, which will help you reduce down time while you have symptoms.",
                "Wash your hands often. If a family member or coworker has the “stomach flu” make sure to wash your hands often to prevent the spread of it.",
                "Use breathing techniques. Breathing is relaxing and can divert your attention from the pain of mild cramps. You can do this while doing something else that will divert your attention, such as watching a television show.\n\n\nFocus on your breathing. Use a fast and shallow breathing rate, following a one-two (breathe in fast, breathe out fast) rhythm.",
                "Avoid certain beverages. Alcohol or any caffeinated or carbonated drink can add to abdominal pain.[29] Sip water or clear fluids.[30]",
                "Try to exercise the cramps away. Take a walk around your house, or in the garden. This can be helpful when you find that sitting or lying down is uncomfortable.\n\n\nYou may find it best to avoid abdominal exercises while experiencing cramps due to the discomfort, especially because cramps may result from exercise itself if you push yourself too hard. Know your limits.",
                "Try yoga. Some evidence suggests yoga may help with stomach issues such as irritable bowel syndrome.[31] If you're familiar with yoga, consider some poses that open up the abdominal region. Depending where the cramps are, consider fish pose or reclining hero. Downward facing dog can also be helpful.\n\n\nIf your cramps are muscular in nature, exercise your abdominal muscles at another time and merely stretch them in the cobra pose. Any position where you are facing up, looking forward or facing the ceiling will result in a minuscule amount of abdominal tension.",
                "Use a heating pad. Place a heating pad, heated wheat bag, or hot water bottle on your stomach to give temporary relief. While some advice suggests not to apply the heating pad to your abdomen in case this brings on nausea, other advice considers this to be appropriate.[32] Decide on which approach best suits your needs through your knowledge of your own preferences and responses to the application of heat.",
                "Pass gas. Allow yourself to pass gas. If you are at work or somewhere this might be embarrassing or inappropriate, just excuse yourself and go to the restroom. You do not want to allow yourself to become bloated or let the cramps become more serious and painful by holding in your gas.",
                "Take a soak in a warm bath. A warm bath can also help with some cramping.[33] Don't make it too hot, just comfortable.",
                "Know when to get immediate assistance. Knowing when to contact a doctor or get help is essential. Stomach pain is a symptom of many different issues and some can be serious, such as peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, appendicitis, autoimmune disease, gall bladder issues, cancer, and more. Generally for stomach pain, get help immediately if:[34]\n\nYou have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharp, or you have pain in your chest, neck, or shoulder\nYou’re vomiting blood or have blood in your stool\nYour abdomen is hard and tender to touch\nYou can't move your bowels and are also vomiting",
                "Determine if your heartburn/indigestion requires medical assistance. Though these conditions are typically minor and can easily be treated with over-the-counter medicines, you should see your doctor if:[35][36]\n\nYour symptoms last longer than a few days or do not improve with medication\nYou lose weight you were not trying to lose\nYou have sudden or severe pain. Get immediate care if you feel a crushing or squeezing pain.\nYou have trouble swallowing\nYour skin or eyes look pale or yellow\nYou vomit blood or have bloody, dark stool\nYour stool looks like coffee grounds",
                "Determine if your gastroenteritis requires medical assistance. The other symptoms also associated with “stomach flu” can lead to a situation where you should see a doctor. These include:[37]\n\nYou have been vomiting for more than two days\nDiarrhea persists more than several days or is bloody\nYou have a persistent high fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher\nYou have lightheadedness, fainting, or confusion when standing",
                "Avoid certain medications before seeing your doctor. If or when you do decide to see a doctor, do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or any other anti-inflammatory medications or narcotic pain medications unless your doctor has seen you and has prescribed these. They can worsen some stomach pains.[38]\n\nIf you know that the source of your cramps is menstrual, however, anti-inflammatories can be taken.[39]\n\nAcetaminophen is acceptable if your doctor has verified that your pain is not related to your liver.[40]"

If you have straight hair, use a large curling iron to add loose waves to it. You can also spray your hair with a dry texturizing spray to help give it more volume. Don't worry above making it perfect or neat.",
                "Pull your hair up into two high pigtails, but exclude a few face-framing strands. Secure each pigtail with a hair tie. The pigtails need sit above your eyebrows and slightly behind your ears.[1] Be sure to leave a few strands from your front hairline hanging loose. This is one of the key parts of Harley's look.[2]\n\nIf you have bangs, consider leaving them out completely.[3]",
                "Spray your hair with colored hairspray. Use blue for the left pigtail and red or light pink for the right. Apply the hairspray from midway-down and be sure to work in small sections. Don't worry about making the color end in a straight line. A little unevenness would work great for Harley.[4]\n\nThis step can get messy. Wear an old shirt or drape a towel over your shoulders. Wearing plastic gloves might also help.[5]",
                "Wrap a thin strand of hair around the base of each pigtail. Take a thin strand of hair from under your left pigtail. Wrap it around the base to hide the hair tie, then secure it with a bobby pin. Repeat the process for the right pigtail.[6]\n\nTry to finish wrapping the hair strands underneath the pigtails.\nYou can also wrap a blue ribbon around your left pigtail, and a red ribbon around the right pigtail. Secure them with bobby pins or strips of double-sided tape.[7]",
                "Backcomb the pigtails, if needed. This depends on how messy your hair got during the previous steps and how voluminous it is to begin with. If your hair still looks too sleek, backcomb the pigtails from midway down. If your hair is still too thin, backcomb them all the way up to the base, where the hair ties are.[8]",
                "Set the style with hairspray, if necessary. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, the colored hairspray might be enough to hold the style. If your hair is straight or smooth, consider spraying it with a lightweight hairspray to help hold the style.",
                "Brush your hair and part it down the center. Use the handle of a rattail comb to part your hair right in the middle, from your forehead all the way down to the nape of your neck.[9]\n\nHarley Quinn does have messy hair, but you will do that at the end. Keep things neat for now.",
                "Pull your hair up into high pigtails and secure them with hair ties. The pigtails need to sit right on top of your head, above your eyebrows and behind your ears. Use a comb or brush to smooth the hair down as much as possible. Leave a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) strand of hair hanging loose on each side of your part.[10]",
                "Dampen your hair if it is dark. Hair chalk can be applied to wet or dry hair, but it will be brighter on light hair. If your hair is dark blond, brown, or even darker, the hair chalk won't show up very well if you apply it to dry hair. Mist your hair down with a spray bottle filled with water, then comb it through.[11]\n\nYou only need to dampen your hair about midway down.",
                "Rub hair chalk into each pigtail. You will need to use bright blue for the left pigtail and light pink or red for the right pigtail. Start adding the colors about midway down.[12] Work with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide sections.[13]\n\nIf you damped your hair earlier, let it dry before moving on to the next step.\nThis step can get messy. Consider putting on an old shirt or draping a towel around your shoulders first.",
                "Seal the color in with a hair straighten or curling iron. If you don't do this, the chalk will rub off. Be aware that some color may rub off onto the heat tool, however.[14] If you are using a hair straightener, twist it while straightening your hair so that you get loose waves instead. If you are using a curling iron, try using a larger one instead to get looser curls.[15] This will help set the chalk into your hair and prevent it from rubbing off.\n\n\nIf you don't have a hair straightener or curling iron, you can mist it with hairspray.[16] It won't work as well as a hair straightener or curling iron, but it will be better than nothing.",
                "Wrap strands of hair around the base of each pigtail. Take a strand of hair from the underside of your first pigtail. Wrap it around the base of the pigtail to hide the elastic and weft. Secure the strand of hair with a bobby pin. Repeat this step for the other pigtail. The colored strands will give the illusion of a colored hair tie. Try to finish wrapping the hair strand on the underside of your pigtail.\n\n\nYou can also use a wide, satin ribbon instead. Secure it with a strip of double-sided tape instead of a bobby pin. Use blue for the left pigtail and red for the right.[17]",
                "Backcomb the pigtails. This will give you a messier look. Only backcomb from the middle part of the pigtails and down.[18]",
                "Set the style with hairspray. Be sure to focus on the ends of your hair where the hair chalk is. This will help further seal in the color and prevent it from coming off.[19]"

        "How to Select a Criminal Defense Attorney": {
            "intro": "Selecting the right criminal defense attorney for yourself or a loved one can be one of the hardest parts of any run-in with the law. It is also one of the most important. It is critical that you find a reputable attorney whom you can trust. There are several things to consider when looking for an attorney.",
            "steps": [
                "Figure out if you need a defense attorney. If you are facing a criminal charge, no matter how minor, you should seek legal advice. Even if you decide not to hire an attorney to represent you in court, a consultation can help you to understand the charges against you. Your attorney should explain the defenses available to you, any possibilities for a plea bargain, and what your next steps would be if you were convicted.[1]\n\nIf you are facing a serious charge, it is highly recommended that you have a defense attorney represent you in court.\nFor a minor charge, you can consider simply consulting an attorney before your trial.\nTo determine how serious the charge is, learn what sort of charge you are facing. A felony is the most serious type of crime. Murder and armed robbery are examples of felonies.\nA misdemeanor is a less serious charge. Shoplifting is a common example.\nInfractions are the least serious charge. Examples include traffic violations.",
                "Research the role of a defense attorney. Criminal defense attorneys are the attorneys that represent people charged with criminal conduct or have had a lawsuit filed against them. Most attorneys specialize in either criminal or civil law. Civil cases are typically brought by an individual or company, while criminal charges are brought by local, state, or federal government.[2]\n\nDefense attorneys will help you with all legal issues related to your case. For example, he will identify key pretrial issues.\nYour defense attorney will issue motions that can improve your situation or possibly get your case dismissed.\nIf your case goes to trial, your defense attorney is responsible for representing you in court. His objective should be to see that you receive a fair trial with a positive outcome for you.",
                "Decide what type of defense attorney you need. You will need to determine if you need a state or federal attorney. If you have broken a state law, hire an attorney that specializes in state law. State law cases include traffic violations, broken contracts, robberies, and family disputes, among others. Federal cases include, but are not limited to, cases involving violation of the US Constitution, cases in which the United States is a party, bankruptcy cases, copyright cases, and patent cases.[3]\n\nIf you are being charged with breaking a federal law, you will want to hire a more experienced defense attorney who will be able to dedicate a large amount of time to your case. This is because cases that involve federal law are often more complex.\nThe key difference between breaking state and federal laws is that when you break a federal law, you are prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s office. A prosecutor from this office has more time and resources to dedicate to prosecuting the case.",
                "Talk to the public defender. It is useful to understand the difference between a defense attorney and a public defender. Public defenders are generally reserved for people who cannot afford private attorneys. Many public defenders have limited time and resources to work on your case.[4]\n\nIf you have limited resources and your charge is not serious, it is worth your while to consult with the public defender assigned to your case. Ask him for an honest assessment of your case.\nAsk the public defender what information he needs to help you get out on bail. You may need to help him get in touch with a family member who can access your financial information.",
                "Look for a specialized criminal defense attorney. You can search for a lawyer who concentrates his practice in the specific area of defense that you need. Many criminal defense attorneys not only handle routine criminal defense cases but some concentrate in a particular area of defense. For instance, some work exclusively on financial crimes.[5]\n\nSome focus on rape defense, violent crime defense, or other areas of specialty. Look for a lawyer who is willing to put in sufficient time to learn about your case and your defense.\nThe State Bar Association in many states offers specialization in law and is the ultimate authority on credibility. Look at the designations offered to see if a specialization aligns with your case. The Bar Association in your state should have an informative website.",
                "Choose the qualities that are important to you. Good qualities to look for in a defense attorney include excellent communication skills, which will help him better argue your case. It might also be important to you to hire an attorney with a good track record. Don't forget to consider his experience with your specific sort of crime.[6]\n\nMaybe ethics are one of your priorities. Ask a friend or family member if they have worked with an attorney they respect and feel is honest.\nConsider asking the attorney to give you an example of a successful negotiation. Did the attorney get the best possible result for his/her client?",
                "Use reputable sources to find potential attorneys. If you are charged with a crime that could cause you to have a criminal record, you need someone who is an experienced legal expert. There are several ways you can begin your search for the attorney who will best meet your needs. Use the internet or visit your local library to look at a variety of resources.[7]\n\nLawyers are often members of professional organizations. States and some major cities have criminal defense lawyer organizations. Call the organization closest to you. Some organizations have online directories or provide referral services.\nAsk for a referral. If you regularly work with a lawyer or law office through your job, that lawyer may be able to recommend a defense attorney. If you have a friend or family member that has had to hire a defense attorney, he may be able to recommend (or warn against) a certain attorney.\nYou can also go directly to the State Bar Website and search under Certified Criminal Law Specialist in your County.",
                "Be cautious. Don't be drawn in by flashy marketing schemes or blanket statements that assure success. Be suspicious of any attorney who guarantees you a specific result in a criminal case before making a court appearance and before reviewing all the documents and evidence. No attorney should make promises before the case truly begins.[8]\n\nAsk to examine a sample contract before signing with an attorney.\nBe wary of attorneys who want a large amount of money up front to handle a case only through initial proceedings and not through jury trial. The lawyer should be honest about the likely outcomes of your case and should never make promises about guaranteed outcomes.",
                "Calculate the cost of hiring an attorney. The cost of an attorney is generally based on how complex a case is. Attorneys will typically ask for a retainer (payment) when the defense will most likely require the bringing in of expert witnesses or if there will be extensive motions made. Attorneys have a number of ways of charging for their work. These include flat fees, hourly rates and fees for specific parts of the case.[9]\n\nHourly rates can be the most affordable, but are also the least predictable. It is difficult to predict precisely how much time your case will take.\nFlat fees are the most predictable but can hurt the client in cases that are complicated. Many attorneys will offer a fee agreement that offers a refundable minimum retainer but then goes up as the case goes past that amount.\nMisdemeanor cases may cost several thousand dollars in legal fees. Felony cases generally start at $5,000 and can run much higher if the felony is very serious, such as those that involve sexual assault or homicide.",
                "Arrange a consultation. It is best to have a face to face conference to determine if you feel comfortable with the attorney. Meet the lawyer and decide if you have confidence in his skills and feel confident in his analysis of your case. Remember that a consultation is not a binding agreement. You should schedule consultations with more than one attorney to make sure you are selecting the best one for you.[10]\n\nIf you feel that there is something disagreeable about the attorney, you do not need to proceed with that specific attorney. There is nothing wrong with consulting with an attorney and then choosing not to hire him to represent you.\nPut your best foot forward. You want to impress the attorney, just as much as you want him to impress you. You both need to want to work together.\nIf time allows, meet with as many as 3-4 attorneys. This will give you a choice, but is also a small enough pool to keep you from being overwhelmed.",
                "Prepare a list of questions to ask during the consultation. This will help you make sure to get all of the information that you need. It can be intimidating to meet with an attorney. By preparing questions ahead of time, you will feel more prepared and less likely to forget to ask an important questions.[11]\n\nAsk about fees and payment schedules. You can also ask for a list of similar cases he has worked on.\nYou should ask the attorney what sort of trial strategy he would recommend. You can also ask about plea bargains and negotiations.\nAsk about your alternatives. You want to have all of your options clearly explained.\nYou can ask, \"Why are you the right attorney to handle this case?\" The answer should give you a good idea of his plan and experience.\nYou can also say, \"How quickly would you begin work? What information do you need to get started?\"",
                "Determine the other members of your legal team. During the consultation, ask the attorney about his staff. You should find out who will work on your case if you hire this attorney and what their experience level is when you meet with the attorney. Attorneys generally have assistants who help them fill in the blanks of the case.[12]\n\nYou should ask specific questions about assistants and paralegals. For example, ask what rates they bill at.\nFigure out how much work the lead attorney will do. What percentage of work will these other people be doing and what percentage of time will your attorney be dedicating to your case?\nNow is also a good time to find out what would happen to your case if your attorney became ill or unexpectedly became unavailable.",
                "Discuss the facts of your case with the attorney. Find out how familiar this specific attorney is with cases that are similar to your own. Ask the attorney how he would approach your case. At this point, the attorney should be able to discuss how he will proceed. You should discuss law office communications and what ancillary services he thinks you will need, such as expert witnesses or private investigators.[13]\n\nThe more information you can offer a criminal defense lawyer at your initial consultation, the more accurately the lawyer can offer to represent you at a realistic fee.\nTake your paperwork to the consultation with you. This includes bail paperwork, and any documents issued by the court, such as the charges filed against you, or arrest warrants.",
                "Allow your attorney to lead your defense. Many people feel like they understand the law. Maybe you feel like since the case involves your future, you should have a lot of input on your case. However, it is important to remember that the legal system is intricate and complex. Your attorney understands the law better than you do.[14]\n\nYou should feel comfortable with the defense strategy. But you should refrain from telling your attorney how to do his job.\nRemember that you thoroughly reviewed his qualifications before you hired him. You likely picked someone qualified for the job.",
                "Communicate openly. While it is important that you respect your attorney's methods, it is also critical that the two of you establish a good line of communication. You should ask questions about anything that you don't understand. You should also make sure that you are comfortable with his strategies and methods.[15]\n\nHonesty is also key to a good working relationship. Do not ever lie to your attorney.\nIn order to present the best possible defense, your attorney needs to have all of the facts. Remember, he is bound by confidentiality, so you don't need to worry about what you tell him.",
                "Get a support system. Being charged with a crime is a very emotional experience. You will likely feel scared, frustrated, and angry. Remember that it is normal to feel these, and other, emotions.\n\n\nExplain your situation to friends and family. Tell them you will need extra support during this process.\nAsk someone you trust to visit your attorney with you. This might provide some extra comfort for you."

With just four ingredients and a blender, you'll have summer in a glass in 5 minutes tops -- and it's 100% foolproof, deliciousness guaranteed. Who doesn't like a good old strawberry smoothie?",
            "steps": [
                "Cut your strawberries into pieces. While the recipe calls for 10, you may need fewer or more, depending on their size. And depending on your smoothie craving!\n\n\nIt'll be easiest on your blender if you cut off the tops and then cut them in half.\nMake sure you're using a clean knife and cutting board!",

                "Put the milk into the blender. 2% will make for a creamy, thicker smoothie, but non-fat, soy, and almond work, too. If you don't have milk, yogurt works as well.",
                "Add ice. For a thicker, colder smoothie, throw the ice in the blender with everything else. However, if you'd like your smoothie to be more concentrated (at least initially), you can just put the ice into the smoothie when it's finished. Decisions, decisions.",

It may need a stir to get the last chunks of ice smoothie-ready, so break out your spoon if need be. Did someone say taste test?",

Or if you'd like something more natural, honey is a great alternative. It's a good idea to try it out and see. If you add too much, you can always add more strawberries or milk!",

                "Halve 10 or so strawberries. 10 is a good number for a single serving, but more is always welcome. You could always double the batch for later! Grab your cutting board and knife and see where the moment takes you.",
                "Add the strawberries and water or juice to your blender. Water will do the job and highlight the sweet strawberry-ness of your drink, but juice will get it more pizzazz -- apple, pineapple, mango, heck, even grape or cranberry. It'll drive down the strawberry flavor, but it'll give your smoothie or more complicated, sharp twist.",
                "Pour in the honey or spoon in the sugar. Honey is mother nature's sugar, but the white stuff will do the trick, too. However, both are optional! If your strawberries are sweet enough, your smoothie may not need it.\n\n\nYou can always blend everything else up and then see if your smoothie needs sugar. An excuse for a preemptive spoonful, really.",
                "Add the ice cubes. The smaller they are, the easier it'll be on your blender, but they'll eventually get decimated all the same. If you're wary of adding too much ice, try adding half now to be blended and then adding 1 or 2 whole to your drink at the end to keep it chilly.\n\n\nAnother good alternative is a chilled glass -- that way the glass acts as the ice and your smoothie stays a thicker, more filling consistency.",
                "Blend on low and gradually move to high. The ice gets pummeled on the low setting, but it all smoothie-fies on high. You'll know it's done when everything is a red fruity liquid. Grab a spoon -- how's it taste?\n\n\nThen you may want to blend it on high for another 30 seconds to aerate. This will give it a bit of volume, too (read: more bang for your smoothie buck).",
                "Enjoy! Garnish with a wedge of fruit -- maybe lemon, lime, pineapple, or more strawberry? A straw and an umbrella, too! Ah, fruity goodness. Have fun making and drinking!"

        "wikiHow to Start a Movie Theater": {
            "intro": "There are many options for opening a movie theater, including large corporate or franchise multiplexes, drive-in theaters, smaller and more specialized movie houses, and neighborhood theaters. Whatever type of theater you are interested in opening, you want to make sure it will be a popular success. While there are many challenges to opening and sustaining a theater, this type of business has the potential to be a thriving part of a community’s identity and peoples’ lives.",
            "steps": [
                "Get familiar with the exhibition industry. Learn everything you can about the movie theater industry. There are books and magazines devoted to the business of movie theaters (also known as exhibition), databases with information like moviegoer demographics, and other resources available.[1][2]",
                "Learn about different types of theaters. There are a lot of different venues and styles for showing movies. These include:\n\n\nMainstream, first-run theaters: These typically show major films at their time of release. They are often corporate or franchise operations, but not always. These usually show a number of different films at one time in individual theaters housed within the building.\nSecond-run theaters: These specialize in films that have already been shown in first-run theaters.\nIndependent theaters: These may show independent films, specialized features, classics, major-release films, or some combination of these. These are more likely to have only one or a few screens. These may also be theaters that open up in a bar or restaurant.\nDrive-in movie theaters: These are open, outdoor areas which show films on large screens to viewers who park and watch from their vehicles. They need special projection and sound equipment, and ramps for cars to park on. Drive-ins can often only be used in warm months of the year. They can be repurposed during other times, for as flea market spaces, etc.[3]\n\nYou can also set up a very simple theater that might be a homemade screen set up in someone’s yard, or a consumer-grade projection system set up indoors. This could be sufficient for your needs if you are just interested in showing films to fairly small groups of people, such as for non-profit community events.",
                "Conduct market research. Find out what movie theater offerings are in your area. If you live in a large city, there will likely be multiple theaters. If you live in a small city or town, there may be one theater or none at all.\n\n\nTalk with the other theater owners to see how well their businesses thrive. Just because you’ll be a competitor doesn’t mean that you can’t have a friendly professional relationship.\nConduct a survey of the local community to determine what kinds of films people watch. You’ll want to make sure you’re playing movies that people will actually watch. If you live in a really conservative area, for example, you probably won’t have a lot of success showing really racy, edgy films.",
                "Decide which kind of theater you want to open. Each kind of theater has specific concerns. Some options may be more successful than others, depending on your community and audiences. This decision will also be dependent upon your start-up capital and potential investors. Choose from among the mainstream, first-run theater; second-run theater; independent theater; or drive-in theater.",
                "Look into theater chains that offer franchise opportunities. Some movie theater chains have franchise opportunities, in which you put up the money to open a theater in the chain’s name.[4] Benefits and drawbacks to doing this can include:\n\n\nHaving the brand and name recognition of a major chain, which will draw moviegoers who are looking for a standard experience.\nEase of setup—the franchise terms will probably determine many decisions that have to be made in opening the theater.\nThe financial backing and resources of the chain, including contacts to film brokers.\nOn the other hand, you may not have as much control over the details of your theater if you have a franchise.\nSome major chains do not offer franchise opportunities.[5][6]",
                "Understand the regulations for starting a business in your area. If you are interested in a theater as a profitable business, much general information about starting a business will apply. Your movie theater will need to be founded and operate in accordance with the regulations regarding businesses in your area—including any permits, building code requirements, taxes, etc.[7]\n\nYou can also start a nonprofit movie theater. For this type of operation, you’ll need a mission statement, bylaws, and a board of directors.",
                "Tally up the costs. Aside from any standard costs for starting and running a business, there are also expenses that are specific to operating a movie theater. These costs will vary depending on geographic location, and size and type of theater and films shown. Estimate the costs to run your theater. These costs include:\n\n\nBuilding rental or purchase\nStaff\nConcessions overhead\nLicensing fees for showing films. These can be very expensive, especially for first-run, major motion pictures. Movie brokers can be hired to assist with the process of attaining films and approval to show them.\nEquipment. This can include projection systems, lighting, seating, soundproofing, decoration, concession areas, etc. The particular equipment you need depends on the type of theater you want to operate. Most movie theaters need to have digital projection capabilities, since movie distributors primarily distribute their movies on digital formats now. The upfront costs for digital projection can be expensive, with a digital projection system for one screen running $60,000 or more. If you have multiple screens in your theater, your costs will be much more expensive.[8]\nYou might also consider offering certain specializations, such as 3D capabilities, D-Box motion seats, or IMAX (large-format, high resolution screenings).",
                "Select a location. Location is one of the most important aspects of any business, including movie theaters. You will want to have your theater located in a place that will be accessible to many people, easy to find, and near other businesses and attractions that will draw people. Having a good location means a better chance of drawing customers and staying profitable.\n\n\nThink about parking as well. If your customers have trouble finding parking spots, they may be less likely to come to your theater.",
                "Look into special incentives for your business. Research the incentives and tax breaks that may help you, such as incentives for green businesses, those owned by women and minorities, and independent businesses.",
                "Pick a name for your theater. Choose a name for your theater that is attractive to customers. Many theaters have classic names or some version thereof, using words like Bijou, Metro, Pickford, Star, and so on.\n\n\nIf you have an angel investor or benefactor, you might consider naming the theater after this person.",
                "Develop a business plan. A business plan will be helpful when seeking financing from lending institutions or independent finances. The plan will show your specific insight into the theater business.[9] There are numerous sample business plans available online that are specific to starting a movie theater. Your business plan will need to include information such as:[10]\n\nMission or objective of your business\nMarket research and audience analysis\nCosts of initial start-up and maintaining the theater\nPricing for tickets, concessions, etc.\nProjected costs and revenues",
                "Secure funding. The start-up costs for running a movie theater can be expensive, but don’t let that discourage you. With a solid business plan, you may be able to attract investors who are willing to put up money in exchange for a financial interest in the business.\n\n\nYou might also look into getting a business partner. Look for someone who has connections with the local business community and who has experience raising money and running businesses.\nSome small organizations run crowdfunding campaigns to raise money. These are appeals to people who are especially interested in your theater, asking them to contribute money to your business. Some independent theaters have successfully run crowdfunding campaigns to raise money to purchase digital projection equipment.",
                "Plan your timing. Figure out when you would like to open the theater. Aim for a time when there will be lots of people in town. Don’t schedule your opening night for a time that competes with a major concert or other event that will attract a lot of people.\n\n\nIf you are planning to open with a certain new film, you’ll need to schedule your opening for when the film is available.",
                "Pay licensing fees to show movies. If you are showing films to a paying audience, you need to make sure you have secured licensing permission from the film’s distributor. There are copyright laws that determine how films can be shown to a public audience.[11]\n\nContact the film distributor to find out fees for screening a film.[12]\n\nIf a movie is in the public domain, this means that no entity holds copyright. Therefore, you don’t need to pay a licensing fee. Check to see if a movie is in the public domain at the Library of Congress’ website.",
                "Hire your staff. Depending on the size of your theater, you will likely need at least a few employees to help you run the theater. At the very least, you’ll need a projectionist and a ticket-taker, as well as someone to sell concessions.",
                "Schedule your screenings. You’ll want to offer several showings of each film. Make sure you have a decent range of screening times in the late afternoon and evenings, on weeknights and weekend nights.",
                "Promote and advertise the theater. Movie theaters compete with many other forms of entertainment for the time and attention of customers. You will have to work hard and do everything you can to draw people in. Market your theater in a variety of media, focusing on how it will provide moviegoers a unique experience.\n\n\nInvite the local media for a tour of your theater. Be available for interviews. If the local newspaper or TV station does a piece on your business, this will be invaluable for your business.",
                "Pay attention to concessions. If you sell concessions at your theater—popcorn, candy, soft drinks, etc.—these can be major profit earners, and in many cases the largest source of profits.[13]\n\nConcessions can be big earners because their prices can be marked up significantly.[14] For instance, popcorn itself is relatively inexpensive for a movie theater owner to purchase, but can be sold to moviegoers at many times its wholesale value.\nPopcorn, candy, nachos, soft drinks and other snacks are standard in many theaters. You can choose to include more specialized food, or even alcohol, depending on local regulations.",
                "Offer on-screen advertising. You can sell screen space to local businesses who want to advertise to your audiences. This is another important source of revenue, especially for smaller theaters.[15]",
                "Consider a subscription model. A subscription model allows moviegoers to buy passes valid for a certain amount of time (a month, six months, a year, etc.) that will allow them entrance to a number of movies at your theater. This model allows you to compete with home video streaming services, and is likely to result in repeat customers while still being profitable.[16] Subscription models can be especially beneficial for independent theaters.\n\n\nYour subscription model can offer passes valid for unlimited movies, or for a limited number, within the time period.\nYou can also offer multiple levels or “perks” with different passes. A standard subscription might include just the cost of admission, while a premium package could include cost of admission and a popcorn, etc.",
                "Offer theater rentals for other events. If you operate an independent theater, consider using it for other purposes. You can generate more revenue by renting out your space for events, like birthdays parties, group meetings, etc.[17]\n\nYou will have to decide on pricing for rentals, as well as policies regarding use and clean-up. The scheduling for such events will also have to work so that they don't interfere with the movie run schedule.",
                "Consider joining a trade association. A trade association brings together similar businesses in order to share information and secure favorable conditions for their business operations. The National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) is an organization that represents cinemas in the United States and around the world.[18] Its members include large corporate theaters as well as independent movie houses. It can be a useful source of information and support.",
                "Attend an industry convention. There are a number of conventions devoted to the business of running a movie theater. These can provide information and ideas about opening your movie theater, as well as opportunities to network. Some of the major industry conventions include:\n\n\nArthouse Convergence is an annual gathering of independent theater owners.\n\nCinemaCon is the official convention of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO).\n\nShowEast is another convention, held in Hollywood, Florida, on an annual basis.\n\nCineEurope and CineAsia are international industry conventions for movie theaters and theater chains across the globe.",
                "Run joint promotions with local businesses. Continue growing your business by partnering with local restaurants, cafes, bookstores and other businesses to offer promotions for your audiences.",
                "Partner with other local organizations. As your theater becomes more popular, think about ways to grow connections in the community. Partner with a local university to offer a series of screenings on a particular topic. Host a film festival. Hold benefit screenings for local nonprofit organizations.",
                "Anticipate changes in the market. As your business grows, you will need to stay on top of industry trends. The market is constantly changing, especially with the growth and prevalence of personal entertainment devices. As the market changes, you must adapt your business in order to survive."

        "wikiHow to Relieve Chronic Constipation": {
            "intro": "Constipation is the most common digestive complaint in the United States, affecting 42 million people. Constipation occurs when food waste moves slowly through the digestive system, leaving water in the food waste to be absorbed by the colon and ultimately resulting in hard, dry, and small stools that are difficult or painful to pass. Though the definition of constipation can vary person-to-person, most physicians consider the official definition of chronic constipation to be fewer than 3 bowel movements per week for 4-6 months.[1] Many people can find long-lasting relief from chronic constipation by adjusting their lifestyle and nutritional habits.",
            "steps": [
                "Drink more fluids. Dehydration can worsen constipation by leading to hard, dry stools. When food waste passes through the colon, the colon absorbs water from the waste. If you are drinking adequate amounts of fluids, the colon will soak up less water from the food waste, resulting in softer stools.\n\n\nStrive to drink about eight full glasses of water a day, or about two liters.[2] Start your day with two glasses right after you wake up, even before coffee.\nYou should drink more water if you live in a very warm climate or when it's hot out. Be sure to also drink water while exercising to counteract the water lost through sweating.\nYou may also need to drink more water as you increase your daily intake of fiber.\nIf you suffer from heart or kidney problems and are receiving medical attention for either of these conditions, consult your doctor about your fluid intake before you make any major changes.",
                "Increase your fiber intake. A healthy diet includes insoluble and soluble fiber. Soluble fiber helps the body to absorb more nutrients from the food you eat. Insoluble fiber does not break down in the body, but this type of fiber adds bulk and water to the stool, making it faster and more comfortable to pass the stool.[3] Adults should aim to consume about 21-38 grams of fiber daily, depending on their age and sex. Women should eat 21-25 grams of fiber every day, while men require 30-38 grams.[4][5]\n\nSources of soluble fiber include oats, oat bran, apples, nuts, lentils and peas. Sources of insoluble fiber include wheat bran, seeds, almonds, whole grains, and most fruits and vegetables.[6]\n\nMake sure to eat legumes and citrus fruits. In addition to fiber, these foods help colonic bacteria flourish which keeps the intestines healthier. Legumes in particular are among those foods that have the most fiber per serving.[7]\n\nIncorporate prunes into your diet. Prunes are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber and sorbitol, which has a natural laxative effect.[8]\n\nAdd more whole fruits and vegetables to your diet. Make sure you eat the skins on fruits and veggies, since the skin usually contains most of the insoluble fiber. Also be sure to eat whole fruits instead of fruit juices, which usually have less fiber and more sugar.[9]",
                "Cut back on low-fiber foods. These would include meat, ice cream, cheese, chips, meat, fast foods, and prepared and processed foods like hot dogs and frozen dinners. These low-fiber but high-fat foods may actually worsen constipation.[10]",
                "Avoid junk food. Fatty, sugary foods like cookies, crackers, cakes, and so on, tend to slow the digestive system down, since the gut is working to get all the calories it can from the fat in them.[11]",
                "Regulate your caffeine intake. Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and soda have a diuretic effect and can lead to dehydration. However, caffeinated beverages can also promote contractions in the bowels and lead to bowel movements. In general, try to limit yourself to one cup of a caffeinated beverage per day, preferably in the morning to stimulate the bowels.[12]",
                "Get regular. Go to the bathroom at the same time each morning. Make this part of your morning routine because it is at this time that colonic motor activity is highest. In addition, the urge to have a bowel movement generally increases after you've had a meal, so try to take advantage of these natural signals from your body.[13]\n\nEat on a regular schedule to help \"train\" your body to regulate defecation. Try to eat your main meals around the same time each day. Your bowels love a routine![14]\n\nSince the mornings are peak times for bowel movements, make sure you eat high-fiber foods after you wake up. You may also want to include a hot drink (such as a cup of coffee) since warm beverages are calming and can help get the bowels moving.[15]",
                "Go to the bathroom when you need to go. Start listening to your body and don't ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because you want to wait until you get home or you want to finish the movie you were watching. The movements that trigger a bowel movement, called peristalsis, come and go, meaning that if you don't go immediately, that urge may disappear. The longer stool stays in the bowel, the harder it gets as more water is reabsorbed, usually resulting in a more painful and uncomfortable bowel movement when you finally have one. [16]",
                "Get in the right position. The position in which you try to eliminate stool can help you stimulate the bowels, although it is important to note that there is no right or wrong way to sit on the toilet. The following tips, however, might help make having a bowel movement easier and less painful: [17]\n\nWhen you sit down on the toilet, place your feet on a small footstool. This helps to get your knees higher than your hips, which positions the rectum at such an angle that makes it easier to pass feces.[18]\n\nTry leaning forward when sitting on the toilet. Rest your hands on your thighs. The leaning forward action will also help to get your rectum at a better angle.[19]\n\nTry to stay relaxed and breathe deeply. Relax your anal sphincter to open your rectum and let the stool pass out.[20]",
                "Exercise. Many people experience an improvement in their constipation when they begin exercising or increase the amount of exercise they get. Doctors believe exercise helps food move more quickly through the large intestine. This means the colon has less time to absorb water from the stool. Aerobic exercise increases breathing and heart rate which can also stimulate the intestinal muscles to contract, which is an important factor in moving stools through the intestines.[21]\n\nDo an aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up for a period of at least 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times a week. If you can, try to do some exercise every day, even just walking for 15-20 minutes. Daily exercise will hopefully stimulate daily bowel movements because as you become active so do your bowels.[22]\n\nIncorporate a more intensely aerobic exercise or non-competitive sports into your routine if you are already moderately active. Try running, swimming, or aerobic classes.\nAbdominal strengthening exercises can also help stimulate the muscles in the digestive system.[23]",
                "Catch up on your sleep. Lack of adequate sleep over a long time aggravates constipation and can lead to a more severe condition.[24]\n\nTry to get between 7-8 hours a night of restful sleep. The bowels can also \"sleep \" night, so when you wake up, you may be able to have a bowel movement since that is the peak time!",
                "Relax your mind. Because mental stress can interfere with relaxation of the whole body, including the bowels, it's important to use some type of relaxation technique daily. Doctors believe that some patients cannot push properly when having a bowel movement because they feel rushed and stressed out. In other words, stress increases constipation.[25]\n\nTake up relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, swimming, etc. Read a book or watch a movie to escape to another world.",
                "Use bulk-forming agents (or fiber). Fiber helps absorb fluid in your intestines and make your stool bulkier, which in turn helps the bowels contract and push the stool out. It is important, however, that you try to incorporate more fiber into your diet before trying a supplement as this is truly the best way to get more fiber. Most bulk-forming agents can be taken in capsule or powder form and mixed with 8 oz of water or fruit juice. Follow any directions on the label and only take the recommended dosage. Potential side effects include increased flatulence, cramping, and bloating. Most people see results within 12 hours to 3 days[26] Common bulk-forming laxatives include:\n\n\n\nPsyllium - Psyllium is a soluble fiber used to increase bulk and stimulate the bowels to contract and release stool with ease. A significant amount of research has suggested that psyllium can relieve constipation. You can find psyllium in the widely available product Metamucil. You must drink at least 8 oz of liquid when you take psyllium.[27][28]\n\n\nPolycarbophil - Polycarbophil calcium has been shown in several studies to help treat chronic constipation.[29][30][31]",
                "Take lubricant laxatives. With the main ingredient being mineral oil, lubricants work by coating the surface of stool, which helps the stool keep fluid and pass more easily. Most people see results within hours of consumption. Popular brand names available in most pharmacies include Fleet and Zymenol. Lubricants are simple and inexpensive laxatives, but should only be used as a short-term prescription. The mineral oil in lubricants can decrease the effectiveness of certain prescription drugs and can also inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamin and minerals in your body.[32]\n\nLubricant laxatives are generally taken at bedtime and may be taken orally on an empty stomach and in an upright position. Be sure to drink at least 8 oz of water or juice after you take this laxative.[33]\n\nPhysicians do not recommend mineral oil for persistent treatment of constipation.[34]",
                "Take emollient laxatives. Better known as stool softeners, emollient laxatives, such as Colace and Docusate, work to increase the amount of water in the stool and to thereby soften it. These laxatives take longer to work (usually 1-3 days) but are commonly used by those who are recovery from surgery, women who have just given birth, and individuals suffering from hemorrhoids.[35]\n\nStool softeners come in capsule, tablet, and liquid form, and are generally taken at bedtime. Follow any directions on the label and take only the recommended dosage. Make sure to take capsules and tablets with a full glass of water.\nFor liquid stool softeners, there should be a marked dropper that helps you measure the exact dose. Ask the pharmacist for help if you're not sure how to use it. Mix the liquid 4 oz of juice or milk to mask its bitter taste and to make it easier to get down.",
                "Take osmotic laxatives. Osmotic agents help your stool retain fluid and increase the number of bowel movements. Osmotic laxatives include Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, and Miralax, all of which work to draw fluid into the intestines from surrounding tissue. Potential side effects include dehydration, gas, cramps, and a mineral imbalance in your system. Older adults and people with existing heart or kidney problems should be careful when taking osmotic agents because of their dehydrating properties.[36]\n\nOsmotic agents come in pill or powder form. Miralax, for example, is a powder that should be dissolved in 4-8 oz of water or fruit juice. The bottle comes with a measure device so that you can take the appropriate dosage (17 g). You can also buy single-dose packets. Follow any other directions on the bottle and only take the recommended dosage.[37]",
                "Take stimulant laxatives. Stimulant laxatives cause the intestines to contract, which moves stool quickly and pushes it out. You should only use stimulants if your constipation is severe and you feel like you require immediate relief. Stimulant laxatives should not be used on a continuing basis to treat chronic constipation. You should see results within 6-10 hours. Popular brands include Ex-Lax, Dulcolax, and Correctol. These laxatives can cause cramping and diarrhea.[38]\n\nStimulant laxatives can be taken orally (in pill, powder, or liquid form) or as a rectal suppository. Always take stimulant laxatives as directed and take only the recommended dosage. This type of laxative is generally taken at bedtime.\nStimulant laxatives are the harshest laxatives on the body.[39] They should not be used regularly or daily because they can weaken the body's ability to have a bowel movement on its own. They can also limit your body's ability to absorb vitamin D and calcium. Consult your physician if you're using these laxatives for more than one week.[40]",
                "Try natural or herbal laxatives. There are also a number of remedies to relieve constipation that involve household ingredients and/or herbs. However, you should note that many of these are not supported by strong scientific research. Consult with your pediatrician before giving any of these remedies to your child. Some of the most popular natural or herbal remedies for constipation include:\n\n\n\nAloe vera - Aloe juice or aloe latex, a yellow, bitter liquid derived from the skin of the aloe leaf, is a powerful laxative and can stimulate bowel movements. However, it can cause painful cramping and physicians do not recommend its use as a laxative. [41]\n\n\nBaking soda - As a bicarbonate solution when mixed with water, baking soda helps relieve constipation and can also provide relief from stomach aches. Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a 1/4 cup of warm water and drink the mixture. You could also try taking a bath with baking soda, by adding 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the bathwater and then soaking in the water for 5-10 minutes. This may help loosen the stool.[42]\n\n\nBlackstrap molasses - Mix 2 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses in a cup of warm water. Then drink up. Blackstrap molasses is rich in magnesium, which helps ease bowel movements.\n\nLemon juice - Lemon juice helps to cleanse the intestine and induce bowel movements. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to a glass of warm water and add a pinch of salt. Drink the solution on an empty stomach.",
                "Note that all of these OTC treatments should only be temporary. If you find yourself using a laxative for more than 1 week, you should consult your physician. Laxative abuse can actually worsen constipation, as your body may come to rely on the laxative in order to pass a stool.Y[43]\n\nNever use laxatives to be \"regular\". Always try to incorporate more fiber into your diet first.[44]",
                "Understand that chronic constipation is common and has multiple causes. Chronic constipation affects between 15% and 20% of Americans. Even people who eat healthily, exercise, and drink lots of water can still suffer from chronic constipation.[45]\n\n\nLifestyle issues - Constipation has been related to a number of factors related to lifestyle and diet, including inadequate water intake, inadequate fiber intake, over-consumption of dairy, and a lack of exercise, among others.[46][47]\n\n\nExisting or new medical conditions - Some medical conditions can cause changes in the bowels and chronic constipation, including colon cancer, hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.[48][49]\n\n\nMedications - Medications that often have constipation as a side effect include pain medications, antacids like calcium and aluminum, calcium channel blockers, iron supplements, and diuretics among others.[50]\n\n\nAging - As people get older, they become more sedentary (and get less physical activity), eat less fiber and drink less water, all of which contributes to chronic constipation. In addition, many over-the-counter and prescription medications taken to treat conditions more common in older people, such as arthritis, back pain, and hypertension, can cause chronic constipation.[51]\n\n\nPsychological issues - For some people, chronic constipation is related to specific psychological issues, including depression, sexual or physical abuse, or loss of a family member or friend, among other emotional triggers.[52]\n\n\nNerve and muscle function in the bowels - In some cases, lack of proper nerve and muscle function can cause constipation. In particular, in cases of pelvic floor dysfunction (dyssynergic defecation), the muscles of the lower pelvis surrounding the rectum do not function properly and can cause constipation.[53]",
                "Take note of your symptoms. Some physicians believe that chronic constipation cannot solely be determined by the frequency of bowel movements, but that a host of other symptoms need to be assessed, or what has been termed a \"symptom complex\". These include:[54]\n\nHard stools.\nExcessive straining when having a bowel movement.\nA lack of feeling of relief after a bowel movement or a sense that the bowel movement was incomplete.\nA sensation that you are unable to have a bowel movement.\nA decrease in frequency of bowel movements (fewer than 3 per week over a period of several months)",
                "Make an appointment with a doctor. If the dietary and lifestyle changes discussed above do not relieve constipation, consult your primary care physician. It's important to seek medical attention if you suffer from chronic constipation or if constipation is new to you, as it can be a symptom of a more serious medical condition.[55]\n\nBe prepared to provide your doctor with information on your constipation, including the number of times per week you pass a stool, how long you have experienced difficulty defecating, and a list of any medications you may be taking. Be sure as well to tell your doctor of any treatments you have undertaken, including laxatives and lifestyle or dietary changes.\nYour doctor will perform a rectal examination to check for tears, hemorrhoids, and any other abnormalities, and then do laboratory testing to screen you for different diseases and conditions. If after these tests and a comprehensive medical history interview the cause of your constipation is still uncertain, your doctor may order an imaging study of the colon and rectum to check for more serious problems, such as an obstruction.\nIn severe cases, your doctor may order more tests or refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation."

        "How to Grow Gourds": {
            "intro": "Gourds have been used for centuries as decoration as for their usefulness as tools and utensils. Whether you want the crop for artistic purposes or you just like the colorful squash sitting in your field, growing gourds at home is easy.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a variety of gourd. Gourds come in dozens of species, each with its own unique shape, color, and size. Gourds come in three general types: ornamental gourds (cucurbita), utilitarian gourds (lagenaria), and vegetable sponge gourds (luffa). Also consider including a few different kinds of edible gourds.\n\n\nOrnamental gourds are brightly colored and oddly shaped, typically used as decoration. The have orange and yellow flowers.\nUtilitarian gourds are green while growing, and then dry a brown shade. These gourds are most often used for tools and utensils because of their tough shell.\nVegetable sponge gourds have a shell that can be peeled off, revealing a center that can be used as a sponge. These have yellow flowers while growing.\nWhile not all gourds are edible, many are. You can eat Butternut Squash, Cushaw, Festival Squash, Golden Acorn, and more.[1] Some other edible gourds include: balsam apple, chinese okra, Hercules war club, and young luffa.",
                "Determine when to plant. Gourds will grow in most climate zones, but they grow the best in hot weather. If you’re in a location that receives freezing temperatures throughout most of the winter, you will have to start your gourds as seeds indoors prior to sowing them outside. Gourds take about 180 days total from planting till they produce ripe fruit, as a result of their extra long germination process. Keep in mind that if you’re in a cold area, you’ll need to start your seeds 6-8 weeks before the last frost of the season.\n\n\nGourds grow best in temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\nStarting gourds indoors simply involves planting the seeds in individual containers, setting up a few grow lights, and watering on a daily basis.",
                "Decide whether or not to use a trellis. Trellises are wood or wire constructs built to hold plants off the ground, and in the case of gourds, are used primarily to encourage unique shapes. You do not need a trellis to grow your gourds, as they will grow fine on the ground. However, gourds that grow on the ground will have a flat side where they lay, while gourds that grow on trellises will maintain their rounded shapes. If you decide to use a trellis, set it up prior to planting your gourds, and then stake the plants to it over time.\n\n\nLarge, heavy varieties (like bottle gourds) will require a combination wood and heavy wire trellis in order to support them without falling over.\nSmall gourd varieties can be grown using a large tomato cage as the trellis.\nLuffa (vegetable sponge gourds) almost always need to be trellised.\nUsing trellises can help prevent your gourds from getting diseases.[2]",
                "Select a planting location. Gourds should be planted outdoors in full sunlight, with plenty of space to sprawl. Although they can be grown in pots, this will significantly limit their size and overall production. If you’re planting your gourds without a trellis, choose a space with plenty of square footage for growth. Otherwise, stake your trellis out in a wide area with plenty of sunlight and little shade.\n\n\nPlant your seeds a least 8-10 feet apart in order to properly prevent diseases from forming and spreading.[3]",
                "Prepare the soil. It isn’t too tricky to get soil under the proper conditions for gourds, which makes them easy to grow in most locations. The soil needs to be well-drained and warm. They like plenty of moisture with a bit more clay than sand (meaning they may not thrive in sandy soil). Test the pH of your garden plot to see if it is somewhere between 5.8 and 6.4, which is the best range for gourds.\n\n\nIf your pH is too high, incorporate peat moss to increase the acidity.\nIf the air is warm but the ground is still cold, the gourd plants won't grow well.",
                "Scarify the seeds. Gourds are infamous for their tough outer seed shell, which is partly responsible for their extra long germination period. To prevent your seeds/gourds from rotting because they took too long to germinate, you can scarify them to speed the process. Use an emery board (paper nail file) or a smooth sandpaper to scratch up the outer surface of the seeds. This shouldn’t take too long; the rough paper should just roughen the coating of both sides of the seed.",
                "Soak the seeds. After the seeds have been scarified, place them in a bowl of lukewarm water and allow them to soak. This should be done for a total of 24 hours, in order to help speed up the germination process.",
                "Let the seeds dry. After soaking for 24 hours, remove the seeds from the water and lay them out to dry on a piece of wax paper. Giving them time to completely dry out will prevent them from rotting before even sprouting.",
                "Start your seeds. It’s a good idea to give your seeds a head start (even if you’re in a warmer area) by planting them in starter sets indoors. Fill small seed trays with your prepared soil, and place a single seed in each slot. Give daily watering until you’re ready to transplant the sprouts outdoors, typically after the last frost of the winter.\n\n\nMake sure the seeds get plenty of light to keep them from getting too leggy (excessively long and straggly stemmed) later on.",
                "Dig rows and create hills. In the location you’ve selected for your garden plot, use a small trowel or shovel to prepare your rows and hills, or small mounds of earth, for the gourd seedlings. If you’re planting many gourds at once, make sure to follow the seed packet spacing directions strictly. Gourds typically need to be planted several feet away from each other in order to thrive.\n\n\nKeep your rows near your trellis if you’re using one.",
                "Plant the gourds. Place each small seedling or seed into its own individual hill; don’t group several in the same space. Cover up the seeds with ½ inch of dirt, and cover seedlings to the base of the new growth.",
                "Care for your newly planted gourds. At planting, water the gourd seeds heavily so as to reduce the risk of transplant shock. Gourds like plenty of moisture, so make sure the soil is damp by adding water on a daily basis if necessary. Remove weeds as they sprout, as these will steal valuable nutrients and growing space from the gourds. If you’re using a trellis, as the gourds grow in size you can use a bit of string to secure them to the posts and give them plenty of room for growth.\n\n\nAdd a layer of mulch to the garden plot to lock in moisture and block out new weeds.\nConsider incorporating an equal-part fertilizer (like a 10-10-10 mixture) to the soil every few months.\nGive your gourds extra water when the weather is particularly dry or hot, to maintain a high level of moisture in the soil",
                "Consider training ornamental gourds. If you’re growing ornamental gourds, it is common for growers to train them into interesting shapes and structures. There are two general ways to train the shape of a gourd: bending over time, and by giving it a mold. You can slowly bend parts of a gourd as it grows, if you want a winding snake-like gourd in the end. You can also create a mold for your gourd by placing the small fruit inside a breakable vessel of some sort (like a vase). When the gourd has grown, it will fill the container and match its shape; you simply have to break the mold to remove it when done.",
                "Leave the gourds to cure on the vine. When your gourds have reached their full size, the vine they’re growing on will start to die off on its own. At this point your gourds are ready for harvesting, but you’ll make the job a lot easier on yourself if you leave them to cure on the vine. Give them several weeks to a month for the curing process to occur; as you check in on them, you’ll notice them getting lighter and lighter. Unless you notice animals and bugs eating the gourds, there’s no fear of rotting or going bad.\n\n\nIf you’re harvesting edible gourds, they’ll need to be removed from the vine when they’re still young.\nIf you have to cut the gourds early, wait till the vine at the top of the gourd has turned completely brown and dry.\nTurn the gourds occasionally and move them around to keep them from touching.",
                "Remove the gourds. The curing time varies from gourd to gourd depending on its size (and therefore water content). Check the gourds on a weekly basis to tell if they’re ready. Feel the skin and check the firmness of the gourds; if they are at all soft or squishy, they are rotten and should be thrown out. When the skin feels hard and slightly waxy to the touch, they are likely ready to be cut. Shake the gourd as the final test to see if they are fully cured; if they are ready, they’ll sound like a rattle with the seeds banging around on the inside. Use a pair of scissors or shears to cut the gourds from the vine.",
                "Treat the shell of the gourd. Although it is not required, you can treat the shell of the gourd to change its appearance and to help it last longer. Wash the gourd with a bit of dish detergent and warm water to kill off any bacteria. You can then use a bit of sandpaper or steel wool to shine the outside of the gourd, and add a layer of wax or shellac to finish off the shine. You can decorate gourds by painting the outsides as well.",
                "Consider saving the seeds. Your gourd will last for many years with the seeds inside, but if you would like to save the seeds for the next year’s planting, you may do so. Cut the gourd open to remove the seeds from the inside. Follow the same process of propagating the seeds (as aforementioned) to help speed up their growth. You can keep the shell of the old gourd, and you’ll have the seeds to create plenty of new gourds as well.[4]"

        "How to Cure Postnasal Drip": {
            "intro": "Postnasal drip occurs when excess mucus accumulates in the back of the throat and creates the feeling of dripping mucus. The condition can lead to a chronic cough or a sore throat. The treatments for postnasal drip focus on the cause of the excess mucus, which may be an allergic reaction or non-allergic rhinitis. A visit to a physician to determine the cause of the condition is an important first step to alleviate postnasal drip.",
            "steps": [
                "Remove allergens from the environment when possible. Allergens such as dust, pollen, pet dander and mold can irritate the nasal cavity and lead to postnasal drip.\n\n\nBathe pets to remove dander that may cause an irritation leading to postnasal drip. It may be necessary to remove pets from the home if the allergic reaction and postnasal drip is severe.\nRemove (flowering and non-flowering) plants from the home.\nEnclose unused pillows and mattresses in plastic to minimize allergens while sleeping.",
                "Use an air purifier to remove allergic irritants from the environment. A humidifier can add moisture to the air, which relieves the irritation in the nasal cavity. When the nasal cavity is irritated, it produces excess mucus as a response.",
                "Consult an allergist or take an allergy test. Chronic postnasal drip could be caused by an underlying food allergy that you don't yet know about or have recently developed. Check with an allergist to see if you could be allergic to something and not yet know it.\n\n\nThe two main allergies are to gluten/wheat and dairy. Dairy is often linked to sinus, upper respiratory, and throat problems, while wheat is often associated gastrointestinal tract problems.[1]\n\nSince dairy is a likely culprit, phase dairy out of your diet for one month. If you experience no change in your symptoms, you've ruled out dairy as a possible allergen. If you experience an improvement in symptoms, you know that your body reacts to dairy by producing more mucus, although studies indicate a no clear link between dairy and mucus production.[2]",
                "Drink plenty of fluids to remain hydrated. Dehydration can aggravate the symptoms of rhinitis and postnasal drip. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can cause dehydration. Water is the best choice to remain hydrated while suffering from rhinitis and postnasal drip.\n\n\nLook at your urine to determine if you're getting enough water during the day. If your urine is yellow, you're probably not getting enough water. If your urine is clearer, with at most a hint of yellow, you're probably drinking enough water.",
                "Blow your nose frequently to remove excess mucus in the nasal cavity. Blowing the nose can remove irritants, which causes a buildup of mucus. For mucus that cannot be cleared after blowing the nose, some people prefer snorting and spitting the excess mucus from the back of the throat, avoiding bad breath and dry mouth.",
                "Rinse the nasal cavity to remove mucus causing irritants. Over the counter saline kits and nasal sprays are available to rinse the nasal cavity. The saline solution flushes the irritants from the nasal cavity, thins the mucus and relieves the membranes in the nose.\n\n\nTry using a Neti pot to clear out the mucus in the sinus and the back of the throat. Be aware, however, that by using a sinus irrigation device you could be removing natural antimicrobial agents that get rid of enemy bacteria, viruses, and fungi.[3]",
                "Use over-the-counter decongestants to relieve the symptoms of excess mucus buildup and postnasal drip. Oral decongestants narrow the blood vessels to reduce the amount of congestion in the nasal cavity.[4] Decongestants are also available in a nasal spray.",
                "Use decongestants for only three days in succession. If symptoms don't get better after three days, discontinue use of decongestants.[5] Use of decongestants after three days may be more harmful than helpful.",
                "Remove mucus with mucus-thinning medications. Medications such as guaifenesin (Mucinex) are sold OTC and taken in tablet or syrup form.",
                "Ask your doctor for prescription medications to relieve irritation and mucus buildup. The physician can prescribe corticosteroid, antihistamine and anti-drip sprays to relieve postnasal drip.\n\n\nCorticosteroid sprays treat the inflammation that occurs with non-allergic rhinitis.\nAntihistamine sprays can effectively treat allergic rhinitis causes of postnasal drip but are not effective for non-allergic causes.\nAnticholinergic or anti-drip sprays are medications used in asthma inhalers, which can help treat postnasal drip as well.",
                "Make a salt water gargle. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to eight ounces of warm or lukewarm water and gargle after lifting your head back. To help cut the mucus even more, add the juice of 1/2 lemon to the salt water and gargle.",
                "Do a round of house cleaning. If allergens are haunting your sinuses, the only home treatment you may need is a treatment of your home. Try the following suggestions to remove dust, pollen, and dander from your residence before they come back to bite you — in the nose.\n\n\nWash your clothes, sheets, pillowcases, and mattresses in hot water regularly. Hot water will kill any bacteria that may be causing your symptoms.\nUse HEPA air filters in your home. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air, and is an industry standard tested by the government.\nVacuum regularly with true or absolute HEPA filters. Vacuuming with HEPA filters ensures that any allergens are picked up during the vacuuming process.",
                "Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. All three may make mucus production worse.",
                "Use steam treatments with herbs or oils. Try out a DIY steam treatment by covering your head with a towel and placing it a safe distance from a pot of warm water. Make the steam treatment aromatic by adding tea (ginger, mint, or chamomile, for example) or essential oils (lavender, rosemary, etc.).\n\n\nTake a warm shower. Let the steam of the warm water work its way into your lungs and sinuses while you bathe.",
                "Try the lime cure. For this you'll need 3 cups of tea (1 huge cup) and hot water. Add sugar to taste and a little honey. Squeeze in the juice of 1/2 dark green lime. Drink this concoction first thing every morning without food. The lime will clean your liver and your stomach (full of last night's mucus due to the postnasal dripping) and you'll feel lots of energy throughout the day."

            "intro": "Happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being. We all want to be happy. But how do you achieve it? Even if you don’t have much happiness in your life, there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of finding it. They say success doesn’t cause happiness; happiness causes success. Life is better all around when you are happy!",
            "steps": [
                "Do an act of kindness for someone else. If you do something nice for someone else, it is likely to make you feel happier about yourself. Getting outside of yourself is a great way to alleviate your own suffering. [1]\n\nTry to do one act of kindness every day. It could be something small – say, a compliment or helping someone at work with a project when you don’t have to. If could be how you speak to someone. Or it could be a bigger effort, like helping out a friend or stranger in need.\nWhen you do kind things to others, they will acknowledge the goodness in you, which is bound to make you feel happier. You could make it a habit to make the first email you write every day be one that thanks or praises someone else. This will start out your day with a positive feeling.\nThe ancient philosopher Aristotle believed that to be happy a person needed to live a life of virtue. By virtue he meant showing such attributes as courage, generosity, and wisdom. How can you achieve these virtues? By acting out on them. Be generous to another person, for example, by sharing your time, your intellect, your care, or your money. [2]",
                "Smile a lot. Smiles are truly contagious. When you smile, you feel happier inside. It’s hard not to! And when you smile a lot, people will respond to you more positively, which will make you feel better.\n\n\nEven if you don’t feel like smiling, just force it at first. Smiling releases endorphins in the body that will elevate your mood. [3]\n\nLaughter is another way to feel happy. Find the humor in life. Watch a funny movie. Read some jokes online. People’s sense of humor varies. Figure out what you find funny, and absorb yourself in more of it.",
                "Focus on the positives. It sounds simple but it’s true. The old saying that you can look at a glass half full or half empty makes a lot of sense. So never forget the positives in your own life or how much worse you could have it.\n\n\nYou could make a list of all of the positives in your life. Write down everything you can think of. Tape it to the refrigerator so you see it every day. Or you could keep a journal that contains only positive experiences. A great way to focus on the positives? Imagine your life without the things you have. What would it be like if you didn’t have your house? Your spouse? Your job? [4]\n\nHelp someone in need who has it worse than you in some way (volunteer at a homeless shelter; help an elderly shut-in). This is a good thing to do but should also help you remember that it can always be worse.\nTry not to constantly compare yourself to others. Don’t worry about the friend with the bigger house, or the co-worker who got a better job somewhere else. Focus on yourself. Chasing money is unlikely to create long-term happiness. [5]",
                "Associate with happy people. Research has shown that happiness is contagious. That means that people are happier if they are around happy people. If you're always around misery (including on the job), it's a recipe for unhappiness.\n\n\nResearchers even found that a person’s happiness can affect the friends of friends of friends. The basic point is that social networks matter. So befriend and spend time with people who are happy.\nThat doesn’t mean you ignore friends who are going through a hard time. It just means you shouldn’t only have friends who are miserable or constantly in turmoil. [6]",
                "Meditate. Meditation will provide a sense of calm and reflection into what can otherwise be an excessively busy life. Many people feel like they never have time to pause and be grateful. If you take that time, it's going to make your life more centered, and happiness will follow.\n\n\nMeditation means you find some quiet space every day to think and remove outside distractions from your life. What form this takes can be individual; for example, sitting on a sunny deck. Jogging. Going for a quiet walk. Listening to music. [7]\n\nMeditation teaches the brain to focus. If you focus the brain, you will eliminate distractions that can cause a great deal of stress. And stress is a common cause of unhappiness. If you’re a religious person, pray.",
                "Smell something you like. Don’t forget all of the senses. The sense of smell can actually trigger good emotions and moods. So don’t forget to smell.\n\n\nWhat smells good to you? Figure that out and smell more of it. Smell your favorite flower. Sniff coffee or food that smells good to you. Maybe you love the smell of a certain fragrance. Stimulate the emotions in a positive way.\nYou could also activate the sense of hearing by playing high-energy music that lifts up your mood. Everyone’s tastes are different. Choose peppy songs that are inspiring or energetic. Avoid any music with negative or sad connotations.",
                "Find your passion. Do things you love and love what you do. Choose an occupation that moves you and that you enjoy. If you’re stuck in an occupational rut, find a way to change your circumstances.\n\n\nTry not to get too sucked into consumer culture. It’s not a strong foundation upon which to build happiness. [8]\n\nSome philosophers have argued that once people’s basic needs are met, they become more interested in things like achievement, freedom of expression, and other intangible concepts.\nBeing part of something bigger than yourself can make you a lot happier. [9]",
                "Forgive. Letting go of anger – we all harbor some of it – can be extremely difficult to do. But if you hold onto old grievances, you’re bound to only hurt yourself in the end. [10]\n\nTry as much as possible to focus on the future, and learn from the past rather than dwell in it. You may need help from a religious leader or from a counselor to let go of deep traumas. However, learning to forgive and to let go of anger is mostly about you – not the person you need to forgive.\nSeek reconciliation in situations where it might be possible, even if that means you have to take the high road when you think you’re the one wronged. It will make you feel better inside to be the generous one. Recognize that no one is perfect, most people have their own version of the story, and everyone’s an imperfect human being at the end of the day.",
                "Exercise. There’s no question about it. Exercise is good for more than your muscles. It’s also going to release adrenaline into the body, which is a natural mood lifter. [11]\n\nIf you exercise regularly, you will also be physically healthier and look fitter, which should lead to a better mood. How could it not!\nYou might meet people at the workout gym, increasing your social network. Or you could exercise outside. This way you will also get the warming rays of the sun (if you live in a warm enough climate). The sun has healing powers. Get out of a gloomy dark house for awhile and you will see an immediate mood lift!",
                "Change your situation. Make an honest assessment of your life. What’s not making your happiness stronger? Are there things in your life that are negative patterns that you just keep repeating?\n\n\nAssess what aspects of your life add to your life in positive ways, and which detract. And then set out to remove the aspects that detract. Ask a friend or relative for their assessment, and see if they match yours.\nFigure out the causes of unhappiness and to what degree you are playing a role in your own problems. What would it take to make your life happy? What life do you want? Write it down. [12]",
                "Be centered in yourself. You need to have a strong idea of who you are and your own self worth to be happy. If you don’t have those things, you need to work on them with a therapist or just by starting to recognize your own worth.\n\n\nBe happy with yourself. Never change who you are for anybody; discover what you like and dislike, and figure out what you believe in and what issues are of little importance to you. This will help you discover who you really are. Then be proud to be you and let it show. If people don't like you the way you are, brush it off and embrace yourself. You are unique and special, so enjoy the wonderful things that make you stand out from the crowd.\nIgnore the opinions of others, unless they come from someone you deeply respect. But random gossip or criticism that seems unfair – don’t let it rock you if you know you operated in good faith. [13]",
                "Develop a support system. You will be happier if you are not isolated or alone. If you feel like you have isolated yourself, force yourself to reach out to others or at least to slowly build relationships, even casual ones. Connection leads to happiness.\n\n\nSupport groups, friends at work, joining a new church or workout club, these are all ways to meet new people. Your support system could be a pet. Many people feel better when they are around pets, because pets provide constant and unconditional love.\nA therapist could be part of your support system. Every individual is different, but sometimes people need help working through past issues before they can let go of them and move on to finding happiness. Don’t feel embarrassed if you need to seek outside help; it’s a sign of strength.\nBe a support system for those who love you too. Make sure to prioritize what’s important in your life, and make sure you carve out enough quality time for those you love and who love you. Connecting with loved ones is a happiness builder."

        "How to Calm Your Horse Down Quickly": {
            "intro": "A horse's emotions depend on her surroundings and the emotions of his or her human counterpart. Some horses have a tendency to be scared easily, or get \"spooked.\" Sometimes spooking can occur simply because a horse comes into contact with an unfamiliar object, sometimes because of an alteration of its routine, and sometimes inexplicably. If your horse gets spooked and you want to calm him or her down in a hurry, follow these steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Maintain a relaxed state of mind and body. Strive to stay relaxed before and during the ride. This can be achieved by breathing slowly and deeply to maintain a steady heartbeat. You might also try to keep a positive attitude in general, which could include soothing the horse by talking or singing softly to it before riding.[1]",
                "Pet the horse before and while riding. Petting a horse before riding as well as during the ride can help keep both horse and rider calm. Petting during the ride has the added bonus of helping keep the rider's hands steady, allowing for greater control of the horse. This control can help calm the animal more quickly in the event of spooking.[2] A good place to pet the horse is on its withers, which is at the tip of the shoulders where the neck and back meet.[3] Simply stroke the fur softly to pet. You can also apply soft pressure with your fingertips or scratch lightly with fingernails.",
                "Use a tempo application. One way to help keep both the horse and rider calm during the ride—thereby minimizing spooking—is to use an application that sets a riding tempo. Acting like a metronome for the ride, the application will set a tempo for each gait, which the rider can speed up or slow down. The rider simply activates the application on a smartphone or mobile device and places it in their pocket during the ride with the volume up loud enough for the horse to hear it.[4] Another way to use this application is to have a friend operate the tempo adjustments with the application hooked into a riding arena's public address system. This is a good way to ensure the horse can hear the beat.[5]",
                "Do not show fear or stress. You may be startled by your horse's behavior if it gets spooked, but the horse will only experience greater stress if you show stress yourself. This is because your stress indicates to the horse that there is a legitimate threat, even though it is his or her stress to which you may be reacting. In this case, the horse can be more difficult to calm, so you really should remain calm if your horse gets spooked so as to minimize the horse's stress.[6]",
                "Get the horse's attention. Horses are generally only able to concentrate on one thing at a time, and the object on which they will likely focus when spooked is whatever has them spooked. If you can get the horse's attention away from this object, you will be better able to calm him or her quickly. You may even need to ride a horse in circles to get its attention off of whatever has it spooked.[7]\n\nHorses can spook at pretty much anything, be it something in the environment, an unfamiliar object, or really anything.",
                "Use lateral flexion. Lateral flexion is a neutral rein position in which you gently pull on one rein to turn the horse's head. This technique helps the horse slow down before stopping, which will help keep the horse from running when it gets spooked—in effect, lateral flexion can help distract the horse from it's own spooked reaction to a stressor. Lateral flexion is sometimes called a relaxation cue, hence its effectiveness in helping to quickly calm a horse. [8][9][10]\n\nLift the reins to feel the horse's mouth through them using one hand, then move your other hand down the rein. Reach until the arm is straight and touching the horse's mane.\nPlace the opposite hand on the horse's neck firmly to keep yourself stable, and begin to close your fingers slowly from the pointer to the pinky, locking the pinky when you finish.\nThe horse should now start to bend to the pressure of the rein, at which point you can begin to move your arm down to your thigh near your knee. The horse should bend at this point until there is slack in the rein and stop.\nIf the horse doesn't stop at this point, push firmly with your stabilizing hand and wait. Release pressure when the feet have stopped.",
                "Continue ride without acknowledgement of spooking. If the horse gets spooked, you can also try simply continuing your ride as though the horse had not been spooked at all. If you have tasks in mind, try to get the horse to focus on those as a distraction.[11]\n\nTasks include training for jumping courses, dressage tests, and more.",
                "Point the horse toward the stressor. If you point the horse's nose at whatever is scaring it, but allow it to drift sideways or move backward, you will keep him or her from being able to run away in a panic because it would mean the horse would have to run toward the stressor. If the horse moves backward or sideways, you will direct its attention in a way that keeps the rider more safe. In order to keep from spooking the horse using this technique, be sure not to push him or her toward the stressor.[12]",
                "Get off the horse. For your safety, first and foremost, you may need to get off the horse, and doing so can help put you in a better position to calm the animal. If you do get off the horse, one way to help calm him or her is to simply act as if nothing happened. [13]\n\nIt is not recommended to always get off your horse when it is spooked because it can be dangerous to abandon the animal. It can also train the horse that you will get off if it acts in a particular way, which is not what you want, so only get off under these circumstances if absolutely necessary.[14]\n\nYou might also try to pet the horse on the withers as above to help calm it.",
                "Consider the environment. Your horse could get spooked if there is a change in their environment. Walking the same trail at a different time of day, for instance, could change the environment for your horse enough that he or she may be more prone to spooking. These kinds of changes in the environment must be considered in order to minimize the possibility that the horse may become spooked to begin with.[15]",
                "Minimize confinement. Horses that are confined for long periods such as over the winter may have pent up energy that causes them to react more dramatically to unfamiliar sights or sounds. Even horses that are stalled much of the time may get spooked by their surroundings, which is why turning a horse out to pasture daily is a good idea. After a long winter's confinement, running in a pasture can help get the horse ready for riding with a minimum of spook behavior.[16]",
                "Consider the experience of the rider and the horse. An experienced rider can help lead a horse in a way that minimizes spooking, but an inexperienced rider may react in such a way as to increase the likelihood of spooking. Horses respond to the nervousness of their rider with their own nervousness, and the posture of a scared rider can be interpreted by the horse as encouragement to speed up. For these reasons, the experience of both the horse and rider is important to minimizing spooking.[17]",
                "Ensure good vision. One reason a horse may spook is impaired vision. This is often considered to be the most common reason a horse is more prone to spooking. An examination by a veterinarian is a good way to help ensure your horse will not spook due to vision problems.[18]",
                "Check for discomfort. A horse that is uncomfortable is more prone to spooking. If the horse is in pain due to something as serious as a medical condition or something as simple as improper saddle fit, the problem must be corrected to help minimize spooking. Some other problems that might cause pain and spooking include the fitting or type of bit used, sharp teeth edges, or objects stuck in the bottom of one or more of the horse's hooves.[19]"

        "wikiHow to Have a Happy Betta Fish": {
            "intro": "Does your betta fish look sad? Is he often resting at the bottom of his tank? Your fish might be bored or even sick. It is a popular belief that betta fish need little to no care, but this is not true. Here are some ways you can help keep your betta fish happy and healthy.",
            "steps": [
                "Know what a healthy betta looks and acts like. A healthy betta eats vigorously, swims around and is active, is colorful and vibrant, has fins and a tail that spread out like fans, and has scales and a body that look slick and clean.[1]",
                "Know what a sick betta looks and acts like. Sometimes, a betta acts sad because he is sick. If your betta is lethargic, check the tank's temperature and test the water. You may need to do a water change or turn up the heater. Signs of a sick betta are: [2]\n\nDoes not eat at all or eats reluctantly\nIs inactive; stays in a corner of the tank, lays at the bottom, or is always at the surface\nPurposely runs into objects, as if in an effort to scratch itself\nLooks pale, grey, or generally dull in color\nTail and/or fins are clumped, closed, stiff looking, or falling apart\nBody has open sores, white cottony patches, red spots or white spots, or lumps\nEyes are excessively protruding or swollen looking\nGills don’t close all the way and stay half-open; they may look swollen or red\nScales are raised like a pine cone\nBelly looks either hollow or extended and swollen[3]",
                "Diagnose your betta’s illness. There are several common betta illnesses that can be treated if diagnosed correctly, but you should be sure about what your fish has before starting treatment. Some medicines work for several different types of fish illnesses, but you should be sure to get the correct one. Some common fish illnesses are: [4]\n\nFungal infection: look for white cottony patches on body and head, closed up fins, pale color, less activity\nTail and/or fin rot: look for fin and tail getting shorter, falling apart, having a darker color, less activity, and reluctant eating\nIck: look for small white spots (like the body was sprinkled with salt), less activity and eating, and attempted scratching against rocks or plants\nVelvet: look for less activity, loss of appetite and color. Velvet (a parasite) can be hard to spot so use a flashlight and look for a fine gold or rusty mist on the fish’s body\nDropsy: look for a big, extended belly and scales that are raised and look like pine cones. Unfortunately, this is one disease for which there is no known treatment; it is thought to be a bacteria that causes kidney failure and may be linked to feeding live worms to a betta.[5]",
                "Isolate your sick betta for treatment. If you keep other fish or water animals (snails or frogs) with your betta as companions, you’ll need to remove your betta from the communal tank to treat it. You don’t want to treat healthy fish or water animals if they aren’t sick, though a complete water change for the whole tank is a good idea if you have one sick fish. Your sick betta may need to be isolated for up to 3-4 weeks while it gets better. Go to your nearest pet store and look for medicines that treat the various illnesses listed above; they will all most likely contain types of antibiotics (tetracycline, ampicillin) or antifungals (maracin).[6]",
                "Speak to the pet store aquarium specialist or to a veterinarian. Do this if your fish seems sick and you cannot determine what is wrong, especially BEFORE beginning treatment. It is not a good idea to treat your betta with the wrong medicines because this could make him sicker.[7]",
                "Choose a good home for your betta. Bettas need a tank that holds a minimum of 5 gallons (18.9 L). Bettas also need a heater, as they are tropical fish that prefer temperatures from 76–84 °F (24.4–28.9 °C), and a filter. Be sure to have cycled the filter, too.[8]\n\nBe sure to always check that your heater is working properly because a heater that makes the water too hot for your fish (over 82 degrees Fahrenheit) is also bad for the fish and can harm him.\nA filter is necessary. For smaller tanks, get a special low-current one. A regular filter in a small tank may create too much current for the fish. Gentle sponge filters are the best as they do not pump water out to powerfully unlike most filters. Do not aerate your fish’s tank, as this might create too much movement in the water for your betta's likings. Betta fish like mostly still or very low current water.",
                "Keep the water clean. Betta are happiest when they have clean water, so be sure to do a 10% water change every week for 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L), twice a week for tanks 2.5 gallons (9.5 L).\n\n\nA 10% water change means that you remove 10% of the water and replace that amount with clean water. Many people use distilled or spring water, but dechlorinated tap water is better, as drinking water lacks some minerals that are good for fish.\nContrary to some beliefs, betta do NOT survive in tiny puddles or filthy environments. Their natural environments are large rice paddies and slow-moving streams. In most cases, the bigger the betta tank, the better.",
                "Keep the tank out of direct sunlight and away from air conditioning vents. Direct sunlight and air conditioning will make large temperature fluctuations, which are harmful to the betta. Bettas are happiest in water that steadily remains 78-82 degrees Fahrenheit.",
                "Buy decorations and plants for the tank. Betta love having places to hide. Tunnels, caves, and plants (live or artificial) are all great decorations for a betta tank. If you choose artificial plants, silk plants are a great option, as they are less likely to damage a betta's fins. Live plants (called “betta bulbs” at pet stores) are popular and bettas like them, just make sure that they don’t become too big for the tank. They can be trimmed down if they do. Betta need to have room to swim around, so be sure to not overcrowd the tank with decor. It is recommended to have one area clear for swimming, and another for when your betta wants to hide.[9]",
                "Buy proper betta food for your betta. A well-fed betta is a happy betta. There are many brands that carry fish food specifically made for betta fish on the market, and you should avoid giving bettas food that is made for other types of fish, even tropical fish.\n\n\nThe types of food made for betta are usually pellets or flakes made up of whole fish meal, shrimp meal, whole dried krill, and some other vitamins and soybean and/or whole wheat flour. Betta are carnivores, so they need a varied and high protein diet. If you can spare the extra expense, you can feed bettas mosquito larva, live brine shrimp, live worms, or frozen and/or freeze-dried live food. Be extra cautious when feeding betta live food, however, for the reasons explained in step 3. Also, be sure that live food is fresh (not rotted) and clean (rinse it with clean water first) or you risk giving your betta an illness such as Dropsy.[10]",
                "Feed your betta only once or twice a day. Feed only what he can eat within two minutes. This is very important. If you feed twice a day, you should feed less (only 2-3 pellets) each time. Bettas have small appetites, so you don’t want to overfeed them. Uneaten food left in the tank will contribute to poor water quality and may lead to disease in your betta.[11]",
                "Watch for signs of overfeeding. If your betta has an extended belly (it sticks out a lot near the lower fin), you may be feeding him too much. This can cause bladder problems in some types of betta. Especially beware of overfeeding if you ever feed your betta live food (mosquito larva, live brine shrimp or worms). They are more prone to overeat when offered live food. It’s even okay to skip feeding for a day once a week, to let the digestive system of your betta rest.[12]",
                "Talk to your Betta. Many betta like to hear their person's voice. You may notice that your betta swims more actively when you talk to the tank. You can also move your finger around on the glass of the tank, or wiggle it at the surface of the water. He will try to jump toward it. Just be careful not to let him jump out of the tank. Betta fish are curious fish, and they like to play! He or she might follow you around the room when you walk around too.[13]",
                "Move around his decorations or buy him new ones. Having different decorations that you switch out at different times give your betta more of a variety of things to look at, and will keep his life enriched.",
                "Decide if you should introduce another betta fish for your betta. If it is female, it MAY like the company of two or three other female betta fish. It is recommended to have more than two so they won't fight constantly if they are aggressive to one another. This is called a “female betta sorority tank.” Be prepared, however, to keep them in separate tanks if they do not get along.[14]\n\nMale bettas most definitely CANNOT live with other male bettas. They will attack each other, which is why bettas are nicknamed “Siamese fighting fish.” A male betta can be in a tank with a female betta for breeding purposes, but you should leave this to professional aquarium breeders, or when you get more experienced with fish-keeping.",
                "Carefully bring in some \"company\" to pal with the betta fish. Again, some betta, male or female, will never get along with others in the tank. Suggested possible tank mates for betta are apple snails, ghost shrimp, red cherry shrimp, African dwarf frogs, cory catfish, and neon tetras.[15]",
                "Watch for signs of not getting along. If you do introduce other fish or animals to the tank, you’ll need to keep a careful eye on them. Signs include damaged fins or bodies in the other fish or water animals. You may not always see the betta attacking, but keeping a careful eye on the health of the other fish or animals in the tank is necessary. Do they look hurt? Are any of them hiding constantly? These could be signs that the betta is being aggressive toward them, and you should separate the betta for the well-being of your other fish or water animals in the tank. If you do not have a tank divider or a separate tank ready, then try adding more decorations to provide hiding places for the victims and ease for the aggressor.[16] Treat the hurt fish first.\n\n\nMake sure to avoid colorful, aggressive and fish with long fins such as guppies as tank mates. Also, while neon tetras are usually okay, some other types of tetra are “fin nippers” (such as serpae tetras) so be sure to research what type you’re thinking of getting if you want to get tetras as company for your betta.[17]"

        "wikiHow to Be Bold": {
            "intro": "Is your self-confidence dwindling? Maybe you're just tired and frustrated of waiting around for something good to happen. The wait is over. Practice having a bold confident mindset, create opportunities for yourself, and learn how to get what you want.",
            "steps": [
                "Stop hesitating and do something. Is there something you've been wanting or trying to do, but can't seem to get the courage up? Whether it's asking an acquaintance out for a drink, apologizing to a loved one after a long period of misunderstanding, or simply being friendly to a co-worker, stop thinking about acting and actually do something.[1]\n\nBoldness is the opposite of hesitation. Whenever you're feeling hesitant in interactions with others, or in making a decision for yourself, learn to swallow your pride and make the first move.",
                "Do the unexpected. Bold people aren't afraid of trying new things, and one of the reasons they're so exciting to be around is that they keep you guessing. This could be something new for you, like salsa dancing or learning to water ski.[2] Whatever you do, be sure to do it for yourself, not other people.\n\n\nDoing something new and unexpected might make you vulnerable or afraid. Don't give in to those feelings. Instead, accept the newness of the skill and don't be afraid to be yourself.[3]",
                "Rediscover who you are. Ultimately, boldness has to do with understanding your strengths and weaknesses, then moving beyond them. Don't try to hide your problems or failures, but accept them as part of you. This will allow you to confidently move forward, appreciating your uniqueness.[4]\n\nRealize that you don't have to do random, uncharacteristic things to discover who you are. Avoid making any uncharacteristic changes just to shock people. Be honest with yourself.",
                "Pretend you're already bold. If you were to switch places with somebody you admire for their assertiveness and boldness, what would they do in your shoes? If you already know someone who's bold, imagine how they'd act.\n\n\nYour bold inspiration doesn't have to be real. You could even think of a character from a movie or book who's daring and brave. Then, imagine their boldness in your life.",
                "Be willing to say no. If someone asks you to do something you don't want to do, refuse. Saying \"No\" will reinvigorate your individuality and help you to feel bold, ensuring that you're ready and willing to go out and get what you want. Don't feel like you have to make up an excuse or explanation. People will have to learn to respect your honesty and boldness, and you'll be getting what you want.[5]\n\nRealize that if you do commit to doing something, you should follow through. Your sense of self-respect will grow, as will other people's respect for you.[6]",
                "Follow through on your claims. It's not enough to simply say you're going to do something, you actually have to do it or people think of you as a flake. When your word is good and you follow through with actions, people will trust you and look upon you as a bold, reliable, complicated person.[7]\n\nIf you agreed to do something you really don't wish to do, you should probably just follow through with it because you gave your word. Next time, remember to say no and assert yourself.",
                "Ask for what you want. Rather than waiting to be recognized for your efforts, or expecting someone to consider your needs, step up and ask. This doesn't mean you should demand what you want or be aggressive. Instead, confidently and tactfully choose your words.[8]\n\nDon't confuse being bold with being aggressive. Aggressiveness often involves imposing your viewpoints or actions on others. Boldness has nothing to do with the people around you. It's about overcoming your fears and taking action.",
                "Negotiate. The phrase \"What can you do for me?\" is an easy and powerful way to throw the onus of responsibility back on the person you're negotiating with. Even if the initial answer is \"no,\" keep the window of opportunity open as long as possible to give them an opportunity to change their mind.\n\n\nPlan out counter-offers before you start negotiating. If you think your boss will reject your request for time off because there's no one to fill your place, say you'll double-up a shift when you get back, or that you'll complete tasks remotely when you have free time.",
                "Offer two choices. One of the best ways to get what you want is to simplify the number of solutions to a given problem. This ensures you'll get what you want.\n\n\nEven if there are an unlimited number of possibilities for a given problem, limit them to the solutions that work for you. This will cut down on the amount of hassle that goes into the solution and ensure that the outcome is what you want.",
                "Take risks and create opportunities. There's a difference between being reckless and accepting risks. Reckless people don't accept risks because they don't even think about them. A bold person, on the other hand, has learned about the risks, and decided to go through with the decision anyway, ready and willing to accept the consequences if things don't work out.[9]\n\nInaction or hesitation is often a kind of risk, because you're risking missing an opportunity. This is a risk to avoid, however. Your goal is to create your best chance of success, not whittle away at your window of opportunity. When you've made the choice to act, do it without fear.",
                "Ask questions. There's nothing bold about blundering into a situation you're ignorant about and not listening to advice. If you're unclear about an assignment or about a topic at work or school, boldness is being willing to admit that you're confused and asking for clarification.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to take the bold step of getting help. If someone is unhelpful, find another person. This persistence to find the answers shows boldness on your part.[10]",
                "Accept any outcome. While there's power in taking on something new or trying to get what you want, there's also the chance you may fail. Embrace the failure. It's not the opposite of success, it's a necessary component. Without the risk of failure, you don't have the opportunity for success.[11]\n\nDon't worry about rejection. This requires some emotional detachment from the outcome. Don't let a rejection destroy your self-confidence and ability to be bold."

        "How to Gain Weight As a Vegetarian": {
            "intro": "Vegetarians eat mostly vegetables, fruits, and grains, though some also eat dairy products and eggs. Since it has no meat, you might find that you lose weight when you first start as a vegetarian. While for many, this is a benefit, for others it can be a problem. However, with a little tweaking, your diet can better support your body's health. On a vegetarian diet, you can gain weight by choosing your foods thoughtfully.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the difference between vegetarianism and vegan. Vegans are all vegetarians, but not all vegetarians are vegans. A vegetarian diet cuts out all meat products — beef, poultry, sometimes fish, and so on — but a vegan diet eliminates all animal and animal-based food products. This means vegans do not eat dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, butter, cheese) and eggs. Vegans therefore base their diets around nutrient-rich plants.[1] The diet of a vegan is more restrictive, and therefore more of a challenge to get complete nutrition (although of course it is possible), and for underweight individuals, may make it a bit more difficult to gain weight.",
                "Calculate your calorie needs. A calorie is a unit of energy in food that, when consumed, is either used to fuel the body’s activities or is stored as fat.[2] When trying to lose weight, you want a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories through activity than you take in through food. To gain weight, you do the opposite: eat more calories than you burn in the course of a day. A vegetarian diet offers many calorie-rich options that will help you increase caloric intake without having to cut down on the exercise or activity that keeps you healthy.\n\n\nOne pound of fat is equal to 3,500 calories. For every 3,500 calories you take in without burning them off, you will gain one pound of weight.\nYour calorie needs will depend on your age, sex, and height. Use an online calorie calculator to find out how many calories you should be consuming on a daily basis. [3]\n\nSince you are trying to gain weight, eat slightly more than that amount every day — but don’t go crazy! Eat about 500 extra calories per day to add up to 3,500 calories by the end of the week. At this rate, you will gain one pound per week.",
                "Continue eating healthy calories. The most obvious way to gain weight is to eat unhealthy, fatty vegan options like French fries or sugary pastries. But this is typically not what a person who is underweight actually needs. While there is plenty of fat and calories, these foods are lacking in nutrients such as protein, calcium, fiber, and other important needs for a healthy body. [4]\n\nSnack throughout the day on foods that have “good fats,” like avocados, beans, nuts, seeds, peanut or almond butter, and hummus.[5]\n\nDrink your calories! Instead of drinking only water, drink juices, protein drinks, and smoothies that will bring in calories without filling you up.\nAdd easy calories through garnishes. For example, add olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fruits, to salads.",
                "Eat protein-rich food to build muscle mass. A lack of protein is typically the main issue seen with vegan and vegetarian diets. Those following these diets should consistently watch for complete protein. Complete proteins are necessary due to their complete panel of amino acids. However, vegans and vegetarians can consume various protein options that complement one another (called complementary proteins) to form a complete protein that has all 9 essential amino acids. They can also simply consume complete proteins such as garbanzo beans, spirulina, and flax seeds. An example of combined protein would be brown rice and beans.\n\n\nBeans are a go-to meatless protein, and also a great source for calories! Ideally, you should eat at least 3 cups of garbanzo beans every week, though you can eat more than that without fear of health repercussions.[6]\n\nNuts and seeds are protein-rich, but some varieties can add too much cholesterol to your diet. Look for pumpkin seeds, almonds, pistachios, and walnuts, but avoid macadamia nuts and Brazil nuts.",
                "Explore soy alternatives. Soy protein is the vegan’s best friend, and is even thought to lower “bad” (LDL) cholesterol levels.[7] Tofu and tempeh don’t have much flavor on their own, but they take on the flavor of whatever they’re cooked with while increasing your protein intake. Some people object to tofu's smooth texture, so you might add TVP (textured vegetable protein) to dishes that need protein that feels like ground meat — tacos, pasta sauces, etc.\n\n\nAdd calories to meals through soy garnishes, as well. You can find soy cheese, soy milk, or soy sour cream at your grocery store. Use these products to add calories to salads, baked potatoes, tacos, or granola without filling yourself up.",
                "Increase your carbohydrate intake. You may have heard that people trying to lose weight often cut carbohydrates out of their diet entirely. Research suggests, though, that low-carb diets are effective largely because they result in lower calorie consumption.[8] Foods rich in carbohydrates can give you a calorie boost without filling you up as much as an equivalent amount of vegetables or beans. To gain weight, include carbohydrates like rice, pasta, quinoa, and whole-wheat breads in your diet.",
                "Eat six mini-meals throughout the day.[9] If you get full quickly, you might have trouble getting enough calories through three square vegan meals. In that case, eat six smaller meals spread evenly throughout the day. You don't have to eat to the point of feeling stuffed, but small, frequent meals will result in higher calorie consumption throughout the day.",
                "Snack often. Even between your small meals, you can take in calories by eating small, nutrient-rich snacks designed to fuel the body. A spoonful of peanut butter, a protein bar, a cup of granola, or a handful of kale chips won’t fill you up, but they’ll help you gain weight.",
                "Begin with the vegan guidelines for weight gain. The vegan and vegetarian diets are quite similar, though the vegetarian diet allows a little more flexibility. As such, a vegetarian should follow all the advice given for vegans attempting to gain weight, alongside suggestions that incorporate dairy into the diet.\n\n\nTry to consume 3,500 calories more than needed to maintain your weight every week. This will result in a weight gain of about 1 pound per week.\nEat calorie and protein-rich foods like beans, nuts, peanut and almond butters, soy products, and so on to replace the role of meat in your diet.\nEat multiple smaller meals to help you consume enough calories to gain weight, and snack often.",
                "Increase the amount of egg protein in your diet. If your diet allows dairy and eggs, you should take advantage of the calories and protein available in these products. While eggs are quite rich in protein, eating too much yolk can cause your cholesterol to rise to dangerous levels.[10] Yolks are healthy in moderation, but you shouldn’t eat more than one per day. Egg whites, on the other hand, are healthy and protein-rich in any amount.[11] Simply remove the egg yolks or buy liquid egg whites from the grocery store to make egg dishes dense with protein, calories, and nutrients.\n\n\nFor example, stuff an egg-white omelet with beans, cheese, chopped tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers, then top it with sour cream, salsa, and avocados.",
                "Garnish meals with dairy products. Just as with a vegan diet, you can add calories to your meals by adding nuts, fruits, and other calorie-rich garnishes to your salads and other meals. However, if your diet allows dairy products, you can opt for regular sour cream and cheese instead of the soy substitutes used by vegans. Cheese, sour cream, butter, and other dairy products are high in saturated fats, so they should be consumed only in moderation. Too much of these foods can lead to heart problems down the line.\n\n\nHowever, just one ounce of shredded cheese might add 100 calories to a baked potato, omelet, or salad![12]\n\nTwo tablespoons of sour cream will add 60 calories to your cup of vegetarian chili.[13]\n\nSpreading a pat of butter over your toast in the morning can add 36 calories.[14]\n\nGarnishing your meals with dairy will help you reach your daily 500-calorie surplus without stuffing yourself.",
                "Snack on dairy products. Cheese should be approached with some wariness. While cheese is linked with obesity and heart disease, it's also a key component of the incredibly healthy Mediterranean diet.[15] The key to gaining weight the right way with cheese is to choose the right types of cheese. Avoid unhealthier cheese like cheddar and Swiss, and look for healthier cheeses like goat cheese, feta, and mozzarella are lower in calories, and can be eaten as a light snack for a calorie boost. Cottage cheese is a popular snack that adds a good deal of protein to your diet without posing a potential health risk.\n\n\nYogurts are also a popular snack option, but avoid yogurts that add a lot of sugar through flavoring. Instead, choose a plain or Greek yogurt and flavor it with fresh fruits.",
                "Consider including fish in your diet.[16] Many vegetarians who choose not to eat meat products still include fish in their diets. This is called “pescetarianism,” and can be a good option for those trying to gain weight. Like chicken, fish is a lean meat that adds calories and protein to your meals. Human bodies can’t produce the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, but these acids help build muscle mass, increasing weight without adding flab. The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week, and emphasizes the following fish:\n\n\nMackerel\nLake trout\nHerring\nSardines\nAlbacore tuna\nSalmon"

            "intro": "While a hip fracture is a serious injury, in time you’ll feel better and should start to regain your mobility. Most people who have a hip fracture undergo surgery to either repair the break with a rod or plate or to replace the hip. After surgery, your recovery from a hip fracture will take a long time, but it’s important that you take the time you need to mend because about 20% of people who fracture their hip will have a second fracture within two years. It may be a difficult journey, but you will start to feel better. You can recover from a hip fracture by taking care post-surgery, undergoing physical therapy, caring for yourself, and preventing another fracture.",
            "steps": [
                "Manage your pain. Your doctor should discuss pain relief options with you. A common treatment includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), but your doctor may prescribe opioids or local anesthesia instead.\n\n\nIf your doctor prescribes opioids, use them with care because they can be addictive.\nYour pain should improve in three days, so talk to your doctor if it doesn’t.[1]\n\nYou can also use ice packs to help with your pain. Apply the ice packs for ten minutes at a time.[2]",
                "Begin to move around the day after your surgery. While you’ll be in pain and will likely want to stay in bed, it’s important that you stand up and try to walk the day after you have hip surgery, unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. In most cases, members of your care team will come to help you with your initial recovery walks.[3]\n\nMake sure that you have help from someone or have access to a walker.\nRegular movement also prevents blood clots, pneumonia and bedsores from occurring, all of which are common complications after hip surgery.",
                "Use a cane, walker, or crutches. Walking after your hip fracture will be difficult, so use support. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend the best option for meeting your needs. Recovery can take up to a year, so don’t push yourself too far too fast.[4]\n\nLearning to walk again may take up to three months.\nThe majority of people who have a hip fracture regain most of their mobility after recovery.[5]",
                "Arrange for help around your home. If you’re planning to return home soon after surgery, arrange to have a nurse, friend, or family member help you around your home until you are able to regain more of your mobility. At first, you will struggle with cooking, cleaning, and caring for yourself.\n\n\nYou may need to spend time in a rehabilitation facility right after surgery. While you may be unhappy about moving to a care facility, it will help you recover.[6]\n\nYou will likely be in the hospital for 2-7 days.[7]",
                "Work with a trained physical therapist. After your surgery, you’ll need to learn how to walk on your repaired hip. You’ll also want to build up your strength and balance to protect yourself in the future. A physical therapist can help you reach your goals in a healthy and personalized manner.[8]\n\nPlan to continue physical therapy for up to three months.[9]\n\nDuring intensive physical therapy, you may need to attend sessions three or more times per week.[10]",
                "Rebuild your strength and range of motion. Your physical therapist will likely recommend strength training and balance-building exercises to help you build your strength and recover. In addition to helping you feel better, these exercises will also help prevent future issues.[11][12]",
                "Ask which type of exercise fits your needs. Talk to your physical therapist about whether or not you’re ready for weight-bearing exercises. While being on your feet with activities such as walking will help you recover faster, if you aren’t ready it could set back your recovery. If that is your situation, your physical therapist may recommend starting with non-weight-bearing activities.\n\n\nA great weight-bearing exercise for recovery is walking, either normally or on a treadmill.\nNon-weight-bearing exercises include activities like swimming or cycling.[13]",
                "Meet with an occupational therapist. Your hip fracture and surgery will significantly impact your mobility, so it will be hard to do your regular activities at home. An occupational therapist can help you learn to cook, clean, bathe, and care for yourself during recovery. While it may take time to regain your independence, an occupational therapist can help you get on your way.[14]\n\nAsk for tips on how to do your dishes or cook during your recovery.\nHave them show you how to do personal care activities.\nGo through your house with the occupational therapist to discuss how you can safely recover at home.",

Use sturdy pillows or cushions to raise your seat if necessary, but be careful not to stack them too high or in an unstable pile.\n\n\nTry to only use chairs with arms.\nDon’t sit for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time.[15]",
                "Sleep in supportive positions. You should sleep either on your back or on your healthy side with a pillow between your legs. Avoid laying on your repaired hip or on your stomach.[16]",
                "Use a dressing stick and long shoehorn. Since you will have difficulty bending and twisting, try a dressing stick to help you put on your clothes and a long shoehorn to assist with your shoes.",
                "Make your bathroom safer. Modify your bathroom with grab bars, an elevated bath seat and a handle shower so that you can easily bathe yourself. Safety mats in and around the tub to prevent slipping are also a good idea.",
                "Talk to a counselor. Since recovering from a hip fracture can be difficult, you may find yourself struggling with the process, feeling depressed, or dealing with anxiety. These emotions are normal during recovery, so don’t feel embarrassed or like you have to bottle up your feelings. See a counselor to talk to about your feelings and create a plan to help you with the mental side of your recovery.\n\n\nIf you can’t talk to a counselor, speak with a close friend, loved one, or religious advisor. What’s most important is that you realize that things will get better and you have people on your side as you recover.",
                "Take bisphosphonates. Since 20% of people who have a hip fracture will have another one in two years, your doctor will likely tell you about bisphosphonates, which help strengthen your bone density. You can take bisphosphonates orally or intravenously, depending on the recommendations of your doctor.[17]\n\nTalk to your doctor about taking bisphosphonates.\nBisphosphonates can cause acid reflux and other side effects.\nBisphosphonates aren’t recommended for people who have kidney problems.",
                "Include a calcium supplement in your diet. Calcium helps maintain strong healthy bones. Adults aged 50 and older should consume 1,200 milligrams of calcium each day. You can find calcium supplements in a vitamin or chew. Ask your doctor before you start taking anything new.[18]",
                "Add vitamin D. Adults aged 50 and older should get a daily requirement of 600 international units (IU) or 40 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D to support healthy bones. You can get vitamin D in either a multivitamin or on its own. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.[19]",
                "Get light exercise. You need to strengthen your hips, so go for walks or do low-impact cardio activities to strengthen your body. In addition to helping you maintain your bones, exercise will also help you improve your balance so that you’re less likely to fall again.[20]",
                "Avoid smoking and drinking. Both tobacco and alcohol reduce bone density, making it easier for your bones to fracture. If you drink, you’ll also be compromising your balance, which could lead to more falls.[21]",
                "Remove hazards from your home. Go through your home and check for throw rugs, furniture, and structural issues that can cause you to fall. You don’t want items in your home that can trip you, fall over, or collapse under you. Don’t try to remove the items yourself if you aren’t up to it; instead, have a friend or family member help you make your home safe.[22]",
                "Update your eyewear. If your vision is fuzzy, then you’re more likely to trip or misjudge your next step. Get your eyes examined and keep your glasses or contacts up-to-date.[23]"

        "wikiHow to Make a Homemade Colon Cleanser": {
            "intro": "The need for colon cleansing is based on the theory that undigested meat and other foods, medications, and chemical or substances that we ingest cause a buildup of mucus in the colon. Over time, this accumulation of mucus produces toxins which circulate throughout the body through the bloodstream, ultimately poisoning the body. Colon cleansing is also sometimes needed before some medical procedures and for some medical conditions, such as before a colonoscopy or some surgeries.[1][2] No matter what reason you want a colon cleanse, there are some ways to make one at home.",
            "steps": [
                "Pick the right kind. Colon cleansing can take a few forms. You can perform a colonic, also known as colon hydrotherapy. This is done using a small tube inserted into the rectum, through which warm water is gently pumped. You can also take an oral solution to increase excrement output, which are essentially homemade laxatives.[3][4]\n\nDoing water or salt water enemas at home without a professional assistance is not recommended unless instructed to do so by a doctor.[5][6][7]\n\nMost mainstream physicians do not recommend regular colonics for healthy individuals, though some natural doctors and other healthcare professionals recommend colon cleansing once or twice a year to help release toxins.[8][9]",
                "Avoid dependency. Colon cleanses can be very helpful, but can also become harmful over time. Even natural, homemade colon cleansers can be hurtful to you. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it is harmless and a serious problem can occur if you begins to depend on colon cleansers rather than your healthy, natural colon function.\n\n\nThis dependence is called laxative abuse and can be an addiction much like any other.\nLaxative abuse can result in damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular system and can be life-threatening.[10][11]\n\nNever use a cleanse more than every six months unless under the care of a health professional.",
                "Prepare to restock your system. Once you do a colon cleanse, you need to put back in certain nutrients, called prebiotics and probiotics, into your body. Be prepared to restock and support your colon bacteria by eating foods that contain good bacteria for at least one to two months after you cleanse. These foods include:\n\n\nBananas\nGarlic\nLeeks\nWheat bran\nAsparagus[12]\n\nSauerkraut\nKefir\nYogurt\nKimchee\nAged cheeses[13]",
                "Talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor before you try any colon cleanse. Discuss the type of cleanse you plan on doing to be certain it isn't going to hurt you. Certain herbs, fruits, and vegetables can interact with prescription medications, so be aware of the side effects of your medications.\n\n\nAs a general rule, anyone with a condition that affects the digestive tract, the kidneys, the liver, or the cardiovascular system should be very cautious about using a colon cleanse and should always talk to their doctor before using a cleanse.\nIf you have more than three to four bowel movements in a day, discontinue all cleanses and call your doctor for advice.",
                "Pick the right ingredients. For natural, food based cleanses, you need to pick the right foods. Vegetables contain fiber that is essential for healthy and frequent bowel movements. Pick the freshest fruit you can, and try to buy organic is possible. You want to be ingesting as many nutrients as possible with no additives. Make sure all vegetables and fruits are raw when you use them in the cleanse. Good produce to include is:\n\n\nSpinach\nAsparagus\nBrussels sprouts\nCabbage\nCelery\nCollard greens\nLeeks\nPeas\nSwiss chard\nMustard greens\nDark green lettuces\nWheatgrass\nKale\nBok choy\nParsley\nCilantro\nCucumber\nBeets and beet greens[14]",
                "Prepare the ingredients. The best ways to use fresh produce for a colon cleanse is to use a juicer or to make them as smoothies in a blender. The juices will kick start your colon and also give you added energy, and the edible skins give you added fiber. You can also add organic apple juice as needed to the juice to make it thin enough to drink easily. Apple juice contains pectin, a kind of fiber which is very helpful in achieving complete bowel movement.\n\n\nYou can mix and match vegetables to your own taste, but you should add enough to have three eight ounce glasses every day for five to seven days.\nAdd some fruit to improve the taste. Use bananas, oranges, cherries, berries, plums, or apples. If you leave the edible skins on the fruit, it will give you an added boost of fiber. [15]",
                "Try a green cleanse. If you aren't sure what kind of recipe to start with, try a green cleanse recipe. Chop two apples, four stalks of celery without the leaves, one cucumber, six kale leaves and add it to a blender or juicer. Add one tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger root and lemon juice. Blend or juice and enjoy. [16]\n\nIf this mixture is too bitter, try adding one teaspoon of honey to sweeten it.",
                "Mix a leafy fruit cleanse. If you don't like straight greens, try a recipe with more fruit. Mix two peeled oranges, one quartered and cored apple, two tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 cup of spinach, and one kale leaf in a juicer or blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.\n\n\nYou can add a little apple juice if this mixture isn't thin enough for you.\nYou can also add some baby carrots for some extra color, fiber, and sweetness.",
                "Make an aloe vera juice cleanse. For a more nutrient packed cleanse, try an aloe vera juice based cleanse. Add together one cup aloe vera juice, ½ cup of rolled oats, one cup spinach, two kale leaves, five Swiss chard leaves, one peeled banana, ½ a medium cucumber, ½ cup of blueberries, and one teaspoon of cinnamon. You can either put it through a juicer or mix it in a blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.[17]\n\nYou can add some honey if it isn't sweet enough.",
                "Learn about bentonite clay. One popular cleanse for colon health is a psyllium and bentonite clay cleanse. Bentonite clay is a mixture of mineral salts, which includes calcium bentonite and sodium bentonite. This clay absorbs many times its weight in water as well as minerals, toxins, and organic substances. This ability makes bentonite clay useful in cleanses. It is commonly used by natural health professionals and has found a place in mainstream medicine to safely treat various types of poisonings and overdoses.[18]\n\nBentonite clay and psyllium husks, a naturally derived fiber-heavy powder, can be purchased online or at your local health food store.",
                "Know the risks. Be careful how much of the bentonite clay you use. An overabundance of this product can cause electrolyte, or mineral, imbalances. This can cause some serious health issues, which is counterproductive to the goal of a cleanse. Make sure to talk to your doctor before your try this cleanse. It is not recommended for everyone, so always follow your doctor's advice. He or she knows your situation and how this product can effect you better than anyone.\n\n\nAlso, always follow the directions on the products you buy.[19]",
                "Make the cleanse. To make this cleanse, add one rounded teaspoon psyllium husk, which can be dark yellow or brown husks, to one teaspoon of bentonite clay powder to an empty glass. Add eight ounces water or pure, organic apple juice to the glass, stirring briskly to dissolve the powder. Drink it quickly before it has time to thicken.\n\n\nThis should immediately be followed by another eight ounces of water or apple juice.\nYou can also get bentonite clay in liquid form.[20]",
                "Learn about the master cleanse. The Master Cleanse is great for cleansing, but it has also been used as a weight loss method. It has been in use since 1940, but it does have some known adverse effects, such as vitamin deficiencies, blood sugar changes, muscle breakdown, and frequent bowel movements.\n\n\nAlways consult a physician before doing the Master Cleanse. You should not do a Master Cleanse for longer than four to five days.\nIf you are pregnant, nursing, under 16 or over 50, or have chronic heart, kidney, liver or digestive conditions, you should not use the Master Cleanse.[21][22]",
                "Make the Master Cleanse. The traditional Master Cleanse has a set recipe. Start by freshly squeezing the juice of one lemon into a cup, which should be about two tablespoons. Next, add two tablespoons of pure, organic maple syrup. To this, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which is about 1/10 of a teaspoon. Pour 10 ounces of purified water on top and stir vigorously. Once it settles, drink the whole glass.\n\n\nDrink a minimum of six to 12 glasses throughout the day whenever you are hungry or feel you need a colon cleanse. [23]",
                "Try laxative tea cleanses. In addition to these other cleanses, you can try tea cleanses before bed. Try teas with laxative-like qualities, such as herbal detox teas or senna tea. Herbal detox teas contain ingredients that will help cleanse your system and energize your as well. Senna has been used as medicine in Arabic and European countries since 800 BCE, mainly as a laxative. You can buy these at your local heath food stores.\n\n\nTo make herbal detox tea, boil a tablespoon of the loose leaf tea, or the tea bag, in eight ounces of water for 15 minutes. Let cool, strain, and drink.\nTo make senna tea, take one teaspoon of dried senna or three tablespoons of fresh senna leaves. Add the leaves to eight ounces of boiled water. Steep for five to 10 minutes, strain, and drink.[24][25]"

            "intro": "Getting a new dog, especially a dog as wonderful as a Lhasa apso, can be tremendously exciting. Whether you are getting an energetic puppy or a wonderful older dog, your life will be enhanced by having it around.[1] However, you will need to figure a lot of things out in order raise a dog that is healthy and happy. Take the time to figure out how to take care of your dog, so that it can more easily become an important and loved part of your family. As a dog owner, you will need to feed, groom, train, and take care of the health of your dog, at the very least.",
            "steps": [
                "Feed your dog quality food. Lhasa apsos, like other dogs, usually eat 1-2 times a day, depending on how you want to space out their meals. Choose a dog food that is low in grains and high in protein, as a dog is naturally carnivorous.[2]\n\nFollow the suggestions on the food packaging when determining how much food to feed your Lhasa. This suggestion is usually based on the dog's weight and how old they are.\nConsult with your veterinarian if you have questions about your dog's diet. They should have good suggestions about appropriate amounts to feed your dog and what brands might fit your dog's particular dietary needs best.",
                "Don't overfeed your pet. It can be hard to resist a cute Lhasa face when it is begging for a little treat. However, for the health of the dog, resist giving it too many calories.\n\n\nIf you do want to give your dog treats, reserve the treats for training sessions. That way your dog will get the satisfaction of a treat and a new skill at the same time.",
                "Give access to water at all times.[3] No matter what type of dog you have, you should make sure that it always has access to water. Dehydration can occur quickly and it is inhumane to put a dog through that due to negligence.",
                "Brush your dog. Try using a double sided brush, one with separated pins on one side and the other with nice smooth bristles. This will give you several options for different areas of the coat. Also, remember to brush with the direction of hair growth, so that you don't tangle the coat further.\n\n\nRemember to brush your Lhasa at least weekly or its coat can get terribly tangled.",
                "Get your Lhasa's coat cut. Lhasa apsos are naturally long haired, but can have short hair, often called a \"puppy cut.\"[4] Either way, they will need to get a cut on a regular basis, unlike short-haired dogs whose fur falls out. Decide which cut you like best and take your Lhasa to a groomer to get the cut.\n\n\nIf you like a challenge, you can groom your dog yourself. However, this takes quite a bit of skill so you may want to do some research and have some practice before you decide to do a full grooming yourself.\nA \"puppy cut\" is easier to care for and cooler for the dog. Consider getting your dog a \"puppy cut\" if you are having a hard time keeping up with brushing or your dog is getting overheated.",
                "Trim your dog's nails and check its ears. These things do not need to be done as often as brushing your dog's coat, but they should be done on a regular basis.[5] Taking the time to assess your dog's feet and ears is a good way to bond with the dog and keep track of its general physical health.\n\n\nTrim your Lhasa's nails down but do not cut the quick of the nail, where the nail is alive, or this will be painful for the dog and it may bleed.\nBegin cleaning your dog's ears by looking in them for dirt and debris. If you see it, clean it out with a dry, soft cloth. Also look for infections or mites, which should be treated by a veterinarian.",
                "Brush your Lhasa's teeth regularly. Like other dogs, a Lhasa apso's teeth should be brushed with dog toothpaste on a regular basis to avoid tooth decay. In fact, brushing your dog's teeth can be a good training exercise and it will help freshen its breath as well.[6]\n\nTo get your dog used to a tooth brushing, you need to introduce the process gradually. Start with some dog toothpaste and let the dog lick it off your finger. Then, the next day, try sticking the toothpaste on your finger in its mouth. Gradually work up to the toothpaste on a doggie toothbrush and putting it onto the dog's teeth.\nIt can take some time to get a dog acclimated to tooth brushing. So, don't worry if your dog has a hard time with it. Just keep trying.\nDo not use toothpaste made for humans. It can be toxic for dogs. Instead, you should get toothpaste for dogs, which is available online or at your local pet store.",
                "Socialize your dog early. Lhasa apsos can be suspicious of strangers, so it's good to get them used to a variety of people and places early in life. This includes other dogs. Socializing a Lhasa apso well can minimize that instinct.[7]\n\nLhasa apsos that are not socialized very well can get very jealous with other dogs. Keep your dog away from other dogs until you are sure that it can interact with other dogs without getting aggressive.",
                "Train your Lhasa to follow basic commands. All dogs should be trained to sit, stay, come, lay down, and heel. A well trained dog is a joy to have in your home and your bond with the dog will be stronger if you have a clear understanding about the expectations you have for your dog.\n\n\nThis training can take some time but it is worth the effort.",
                "Train your dog to go to the bathroom outside. This is an important training process so that the dog knows where and when to go to the bathroom and so that it does not have accidents in the house. Potty training can take some time, especially with a stubborn dog like a Lhasa apso, so take your time and try to be patient.[8] With enough work and consistency, your dog will get the hang of it.\n\n\nSome pet owners use \"pee pads\" so that a dog can go to the bathroom inside. If you want to do this, you will still need to train the dog to go on the pad and not other places in your home.",
                "Be vigilant and consistent about training. Some Lhasa's are stubborn and difficult to train. However, if you are consistent and unwilling to give up, your dog will be more likely to learn to follow your commands.\n\n\nLhasas often are not motivated to listen to humans or follow their directions. Because of this, make sure you have a small treat to use for training, as this will make the dog more likely to pay attention to you.",
                "Take the dog for regular veterinary checkups. This is very important in order to keep your Lhasa in tip top shape. Your veterinarian will make sure that the dog is up to date on its vaccinations and that its general health is fine.\n\n\nLhasa apsos do not really suffer from many hereditary diseases, however they can have problems with their kidneys.[9] Have your Lhasa screened for renal dysplasia so that you can start treatment before an issue becomes serious.",
                "Give your dog regular exercise. Even though a Lhasa apso does not require as much exercise as a working dog, for instance, that does not mean that it doesn't require any exercise. Walk and play with him or her often. In fact, Lhasa apsos enjoy daily walks and regular play times.[10]\n\nMake sure your dog is on a leash for walks. Lhasas can be very interested in strangers and new areas, so if off leash it may wonder off.",
                "Be affectionate to your dog. As a dog, the thing it needs most is love. This love can be shown by playing with your dog, going to the dog park, playing inside, or just snuggling on the couch. However you like to spend time with your dog, do it.\n\n\nJust be sure to give it enough attention so that it doesn't get depressed due to loneliness.\nHowever, Lhasa apso are usually ok if you leave them at home while you go to work. They do not usually get separation anxiety like some other breeds do.[11]"

            "intro": "When you’re friends with someone, chances are you like a lot of the same things, from clothes to movies to pastimes. But what happens when you both like the same guy? While it can be upsetting and discouraging if your crush likes your friend, it can be extremely awkward and uncomfortable if your crush likes you. There are a few things you can do to navigate this tricky situation.",
            "steps": [
                "Be honest about the situation. It might be scary or intimidating, but put all of your thoughts and feelings on the table. If you really like this boy, tell her. If he’s hinted or flat out told you that he returns those feelings, tell her. While it may hurt your friend at first, it will feel worse if she feels like you’ve lied or left her in the dark.[1]\n\nThis is especially important if this is a very close friend that you share everything with. If you start a relationship with this guy secretly, she will automatically be distrustful or resentful of it, and you could really hurt her feelings.",
                "Put yourself in her shoes. When you have a crush on someone and the feeling is returned, it feels pretty awesome; however, try to imagine or remember what it’s like when those feelings aren’t returned. Recognize that your friend may feel really down in the dumps, and take care not to gloat or shove your happiness in her face.[2]\n\nWhen you are with her, remember that it's okay to talk about your crush, but don't let him be the only thing you talk about. If she is hurt the crush might be a sore topic.",
                "Tell her what you plan to do. You need to decide this before going into the conversation. It’s entirely up to you to decide how to proceed in this situation. You can tell her that you really like this guy, you want to date him, but you won’t go forward with it unless you have her blessing. Alternatively, you can tell her that you plan on pursuing a relationship with him, and you’d like her support.\n\n\nEvaluate the consequences (both good and bad) of dating your crush before you decide what to do. Think about how this might impact your relationship with your friend, and if you like this guy enough to risk straining, harming, or even ending your friendship. Is this just a casual crush or someone you can see getting serious with? Think about your friend's personality — does she have a hard time moving on from things? Is she the type who would see this as a betrayal, or be sad for a little while and then bounce back?[3] Weigh the pros and cons of pursuing this relationship so you can go into the conversation with your friend with eyes wide open.\nIf you tell your friend that you will not date him unless she’s comfortable with it, you need to stick to that. Keep in mind that if your friend disapproves of your relationship, it can cause a major strain on it.[4]\n\nAt the end of the day, it is your life. If you want to date your crush with or without your friend’s approval, you can; however, you should be prepared for the consequences to your friendship.\nYou can still be caring toward your friend even if you decide to date your crush without her approval. You could say, “I really care about you and our friendship, and I’m excited about possibly dating John. I hope that you can eventually be happy for me. I will not let my dating life get in the way of our friendship.”",
                "Respect your friend’s emotions. Whether she is angry, upset, or jealous, she is still your friend. You do not have to change your plans based on her emotions, and you do not have to agree with everything she says, but you should be a kind person.[5] Remember, she is probably hurt that her crush has chosen you. Be gentle, honest, and loving while she heals from rejection.\n\n\nThis is particularly important if she’s been a long-term, loyal friend. Your crush may be really great, but your friend is too. It’s OK (and human!) to want relationships with both, but take care not to neglect your friend for this guy.",
                "Tell your crush your feelings. If you’ve told your friend how you feel, you might as well clue him in too. While sometimes a crush consists of flirting and subtle hints, it will make the situation easier on everyone if you know where your crush stands.[6] For example, there’s no need to do damage control on your friendship if you discover he likes someone else!\n\n\nOnce both of your feelings are out in the open, you are able to decide how to proceed.",
                "Keep the situation with your friend private. In other words, don’t betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about her. She may like him and she may be hurt — but that doesn’t mean he needs to know that. Talk to your crush about your own feelings, and let your friend keep hers private if she wishes.[7] Your friend will be hurt and embarrassed if she discovers you’ve been airing her dirty laundry to a boy she has feelings for.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself. Talk only about your own feelings and desires, not anyone else’s.",
                "Take things slow. If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship, take your time. Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything. A slow and steady start can make for a healthy, solid relationship, too.[8]\n\nThat doesn’t mean you need to lie to your friend and pretend that things aren’t happening with your crush. It just means letting her cope with the situation at a slower pace.\nIf your crush doesn’t respect or understand your need to take things slowly, he may not be the right guy for you after all.",
                "Be discreet with your actions. Just because your friend has given her approval, that probably doesn’t mean she wants to see you holding hands or kissing all the time. Respect her enough to keep your PDA and pet names to a minimum in her presence. If you want to call your boyfriend Hot Lips and sit on his lap in private, that’s your prerogative. Your friend doesn’t need to see that though. On that note, your friends who never had a crush on him probably don’t want to see that either, so keep the PDA to a minimum.[9]",
                "Nurture your friendship. Don’t neglect your friend in order to spend all your time with this boy. A new relationship can be exciting, and it’s easy to want to spend all your time with your crush; however, you need to show your friend that you value your friendship and aren’t going anywhere.[10]\n\nIf your friend tries to pull away because of hurt feelings, give her space but let her know that you cherish your friendship. You “won” the guy, so be loving and gracious with your friend.[11]",
                "Wait until she’s moved on to “gush.” If your new boyfriend sends you a dozen roses and writes you a sonnet, it’s only natural to want to spill all the details to your friend; however, you should just wait. Until she’s solidly moved on, just bite your tongue when it comes to that kind of conversation. It will only seem like you’re rubbing her face in your good fortune, and it could make her resentful. Enjoy your relationship privately, and separate it from your friendship — at least for awhile."

You don’t need a large amount of glue, just enough to cover the surface of the earring flatback.[2]\n\nSuperglue also works if you are in a hurry. If using superglue, then you can apply the earring glue directly onto the earring flatback with the tube. Only use a small amount and be careful not to get any on your skin or other surfaces.\nBe sure to work over a paper towel to avoid getting glue onto your table and other surfaces.",

Hold the pieces firmly together for a minute to give them a chance to bond. Then, place the earring on your paper towel to dry the rest of the way.[3]\n\nIf the earring piece you have added has a flat surface, such as a button or flat pennant, then place the earring face down rather than on its side.",
                "Allow glue to dry. Leave the earrings alone to dry for a few hours or overnight. It is important to let them dry completely before you wear them.[4]\n\nIf you used superglue, then your earrings will be ready after just a few minutes. However, you may still want to leave them be for up to an hour to let the glue dry and bond completely.",
                "Look for beads and buttons in craft stores. Craft stores are the best place to find all kinds of different beads, buttons, and other cool things to make into stud earrings. Look for items that have a flat surface on one side. This will make it much easier to attach the items to the earring flatbacks.\n\n\nIf using buttons for your earrings, you may want to paint over the button with some clear nail polish before gluing it onto the stud flatback. This will make the button shiny if it is a matte button.[5] Let the nail polish dry completely before gluing it onto the stud.",
                "Use clay to make your own designs. If you want to create your own beads to glue onto the earrings, then clay beads are a great option. Try getting some air drying clay in your local craft store and then shape the clay into bead to glue onto your earring flatbacks. You can use multiple colors of clay to create interesting designs in the clay.",
                "Make a pair of bow earrings.[6] You can tie ribbon into a bow and then glue the bow onto a flatback for a cute pair of bow earrings.

If you want to make a special pair of earrings for a holiday, such as St Patrick’s day, Halloween, or Christmas, then you can look for holiday themed pieces to glue onto stud earring flatbacks. Craft stores are the best place to find these kinds of items.\n\n\nFor example, you could glue a four leaf clover charm onto an earring flatback for St. Patrick’s Day, or glue a jack-o-lantern piece onto an earring flatback for Halloween. You can make yourself a pair of holiday themed stud earrings for every holiday of the year!",
                "Try using old jewelry. If you don’t want to buy any new beads or other notions to turn into earrings, then you can also convert your old, unwanted jewelry into stud earrings.

A pescetarian (or pescatarian) diet is a great eating pattern to help you focus on healthy plant-based foods, while giving you more flexibility with the inclusion of eating fish and shellfish. It can be an easier way to reduce the amount of meat you consume Following these tips can help you transition to a pescetarian diet.",
            "steps": [
                "Commit to going meat-less. Typically, pescetarians follow a plant-based diet and do not consume red meat, poultry, pork or lamb. The majority of their protein is coming from plant-based sources like beans, nuts or lentils in addition to fish and shellfish. All other food groups — like whole grains, fruits and vegetables — are consumed on a regular basis.\n\n\nA healthy diet goes beyond limiting animal products. In addition, you want to focus on well-balanced meals, healthy cooking techniques, limiting processed foods and refined sugar and drinking adequate amounts of water each day.\nPescetarian diets are also beneficial to your health. They may help you manage or lower your cholesterol levels, and reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease.[2]",
                "Design your pescetarian diet. Depending on how restrictive you want your diet to be, you may chose to include or not include foods like eggs and dairy products; however, if you're transitioning from a typical, average diet, it may be easier to include dairy foods and eggs to help give you some variety.\n\n\nIncorporate a variety of proteins into your pescetarian diet outside of seafood. If you're consuming eggs and dairy products, they're an excellent source of protein. In fact, the egg has the highest biological value of all proteins. The biological value provides a measurement of how efficient the body utilizes protein consumed in the diet.[3] In addition, don't forget about beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains!\nEnsure that your meals feature fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy (if you're including this) each day. This means you have a well-balanced diet.",
                "Purchase print resources. Take a trip to your local or online book store and think about buying a few quality printed resources. Cookbooks and magazines that feature pescetarian recipes will help motivate and excite you as your transition to this new eating pattern.\n\n\nCookbooks have a wide arrangement of recipes and are a great resource to browse through. Plus, they generally have great photographs which can help motivate you to continue with your new eating pattern.\nGo beyond printed resources and find bloggers that post regularly about pescetarian recipes. They might also have good tips on adopting this new eating pattern.",
                "Find other pescetarians. Finding friends, co-workers or others who also follow a pescetarian diet can be helpful. They'll be a great support to you as you make your new diet transition.\n\n\nYou can try joining online communities or forums where you can post questions, link up with other pescetarians and get helpful information from others already following this diet pattern.\nTake a cooking class. Many restaurants, cooking stores and private companies offer cooking classes. Try signing up with a friend or family member for a class that focuses on seafood preparation.",
                "Discuss your new diet with your family. Transitioning to a new diet may affect more than just you. If you're living at home with your family, your dietary changes may influence what is purchased and prepared at home. Speak to your family members about what you'll be changing in your diet and what foods you will and will not be eating. Make sure they fully understand what a pescetarian diet is.\n\n\nIf some family members want to continue eating meat or animal products, that's OK. Discuss with them how you can accommodate both eating styles in your household. A quick family meeting will help.\nAsk your family members if they'd be interesting in following a pescetarian diet along with you. They might be interested in following a pescetarian diet a few days a week or a few specific meals during the week. Finding a common ground may help cut down on extra food prep for a variety of different eating patterns.",
                "Prep your kitchen. Switching to any new diet or eating pattern will most likely require that you prep your kitchen and re-stock your pantry and refrigerator with new or different types of foods. Purchase a variety of seafood each week.\n\n\nKeep frozen seafood, canned tuna or salmon or frozen salmon or tuna burgers on hand as well. They have a longer shelf life and can be used in a pinch or when fresh seafood isn't available.\nYou might also want to consider purchasing special kitchen tools or equipment. For example, a fish filleting knife, fish spatula or boning tweezers; however, these aren't necessary for general seafood preparation.\nPurchase spices or seasonings that complement seafood well. For example, Old Bay is a mixed seasoning blend designed for fish and shellfish. It's a quick all-in-one spice that will boost up the flavor of your dishes.\nIn addition, stock up on fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains so you have all the food groups to make well-balanced meals.",
                "Create weekly meal plans. If you're busy or on the go, prepping weekly meal plans can help you easily implement a pescetarian diet. Take an hour or two each week and write out each of your meals. Then, write up a grocery list of all the items you need to purchase that week. It'll help keep you on track and minimize the time you spending shopping and looking for items in the store.\n\n\nFind meals that can be prepared in advanced. If your weeknights are busy, doing some meal prep on the weekends or during your free time can make weeknight dinners a breeze. Prepare lunches or parts of your dinners ahead to cut down on cooking time.\nCreating meal plans in advance can also help cut down on costs. You'll buy the items that you need and skip purchasing things you think you need but already have at home.\nBreakfast ideas can include: whole wheat English muffin with an egg and cheese; an individual low-fat Greek yogurt with fruit; or high-fiber, high-protein cereal with almond milk.\nLunch ideas can include: grilled salmon over a spinach salad; two grilled shrimp and vegetable soft tacos; or lentil and vegetable salad with a vinaigrette dressing.\nDinner ideas can include: grilled mahimahi with brown rice and steamed mixed vegetables; portobello mushroom burgers with baked sweet potato fries; or salmon burgers and a small green salad.",
                "Prepare pescetarian recipes. Seafood can be intimidating to prepare. Many people have never tried or only prepared one or two types of fish. Review a variety of recipes and keep trying new things. The longer you stick with the plan, the more comfortable you'll become preparing a wide variety of fish and shellfish.\n\n\nTry to incorporate some cold-water fish like salmon, tuna or mackerel. These fish are known as \"fatty fish\" and generally contain higher amounts of heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Try to consume these anywhere from two to three times per week.\nIf preparing a seafood-based meal each night is overwhelming, try focusing on one new recipe or one new type of seafood per week. This will help expose you to a variety of cooking techniques, but will be less stressful.\nStart with a simple meal or recipe. Or incorporate recipes you already make that feature seafood more often into your weekly meals.",
                "Incorporate plant-based proteins. Fish and seafood are the defining trademarks of a pescetarian diet; however, don't forget about plant-based sources of protein too. Items like beans, lentils, nuts and whole grains are healthy, lean sources of protein.\n\n\nMeat replacements, tofu, tempeh, seitan and veggie burgers are other great sources of protein that will fit into a pescetarian diet.\nKeep a stock of canned beans, nuts and whole grains for quick and easy meals.\nPlant-based proteins can also be the main source of protein in your meals. It's not necessary to make seafood the main source of protein in each meal. Quinoa, for example, is a great source of protein as it contains all nine essential amino acids.",
                "Find a reliable fishmonger. It's important to find a trustworthy market with knowledgeable staff. The fishmonger is person at the store or market who orders, handles and manages all the seafood and the department. They will be able to provide accurate information on the quality of the seafood, whether it was fresh or frozen, whether it was farmed or wild and how sustainable the fish is.\n\n\nTry to avoid road-side stands that sell seafood. You won't be able to tell where or when the seafood was harvested or know the reliability of the individual selling it to you.\nAlso invest some time reading and researching websites like Seafood Health Facts or Fish Watch. They are reliable, trustworthy sources of information. They review the safety, sustainability and health of seafood.",
                "Choose both fresh and frozen fish. Many people think that fresh foods are always better; however, many times frozen foods — especially seafood — are sometimes more fresh. When fish and shellfish are harvested, they are immediately cleaned and frozen on the boat — at the peak of freshness. Many times, seafood that's labeled as fresh was harvested several days prior, however it should have never been previously frozen.\n\n\nEnsure you thaw frozen fish properly. Take frozen items and place them in a sealed container in the bottom of the refrigerator and allow them to defrost overnight.\nPurchase frozen fish that's packaging is intact and completely frozen solid.\nAt well-stocked grocery stores and markets, there are a large variety of frozen fish and shellfish available. Your options are far from limited if you choose frozen items.",
                "Evaluate the quality of your fish. Once you have chosen the store or market where you're going to purchase your seafood, evaluate the quality and freshness of the options available. Look at the display or counter. All seafood should be kept at 32 °F (0 °C) and be on ice.[4]\n\nWhen you're purchasing whole fish like a trout or mackerel, pay attention to the eyes. They should be bright and clear. As fish ages, the eyes will get cloudy and sunk in — this will indicate fish that is not fresh.\nFish fillets should have firm, elastic flesh. They should also have a clear, shiny appearance to them. Fillets that are prepackaged should contain some liquid, however it should be at a minimum.\nShellfish like mussels, oysters or clams can be sold live, cooked or freshly shucked. If you're purchasing live shellfish, look for unbroken shells that close tightly if squeezed. If the shells do not close, they are most likely dead and not fresh.\nScallops are also considered shellfish, but are generally sold freshly shucked. They should be firm with a creamy white color and a slightly sweet smell. Scallops that smell sour indicate they are most likely spoiled.\nDo not hesitate to ask to look at your fish selections up close. You'll get a better idea of what it smells like, how its flesh looks and its overall appearance.",
                "Research sustainable seafood options. Try to choose fish and shellfish that are ethically farmed or raised. You can always ask your fishmonger for more information on the items they have for sale. In addition, check out the EDF Seafood Selector Guide for more information.\n\n\nSustainable seafood includes fisheries that handle plentiful species in addition to species that are lower on the food chain (they can reproduce quicker and maintain an adequate population).[5]They also have to maintain a variety of very high standards and fishing practices.\nChoosing fish and shellfish that are sustainable helps ensure some more rare species are not overfished. When certain species are overfished, it increases their chances to reach critically low levels which can affect the environment, food chain and the longevity of the species.\nSustainable species include fish such as: Alaskan Cod, farmed Artic Char, Atlantic Pollock, Catfish, Dover Sole, U.S. MahiMahi, Alaskan and Canadian Halibut and farmed Rainbow Trout [6].",
                "Decide on eggs and dairy. Many plant-based diets like the pescetarian diet do include eggs and dairy products while others do not. These foods, especially when ethically raised, are a great and healthy addition to your diet. Both are wonderful sources of protein in addition to having a variety of important nutrients.\n\n\nYou can also trying using dairy alternatives like soy or almond milk, soy based yogurt or vegan cheeses. This will allow you more flexibility with your food choices and recipes.\nIf you choose to omit eggs and dairy be mindful to replace the nutrients prevalent in those foods. For example, dairy foods are high in calcium. Try getting your daily calcium from foods like dark greens, almonds or fortified orange juice.",
                "Eat fruits and vegetables daily. Although a pescetarian diet does have a focus on fish and shellfish, you cannot forget about the main components of this type of diet — fruits and vegetables. Produce is truly the crux of all healthy diets. These plants are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. They're incredibly important to your diet and health.\n\n\nMake 50% of most of your meals a fruit or vegetable. These low-calorie, nutrition powerhouses will fill you up, keep you satisfied and add an array of nutrients to your diet.\nWhen you're including fruits and vegetables into your diet, try to eat fruits and vegetables that are different in color each day. You'll get a variety of different nutrients with each colored fruit or vegetable.",
                "Include whole grains. Many people forget that whole grains are not only a great source of fiber, but also contain protein.\n\n\nPair whole grains with legumes like lentils and beans for the perfect protein combo. Pairing these two types of foods together makes them a complete protein. This means, this combination has all of the necessary amino acids for your body.\nAim to make most of your grain choices whole grain if possible. Try whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, 100% whole wheat pasta, farro or oats."

        "wikiHow to Grow Basil Indoors": {
            "intro": "Basil is a popular, fragrant herb with a variety of culinary uses. It grows easily in outdoor gardens, and with a few minor alterations, you can grow basil indoors without much hassle, as well. Sufficient amounts of sun and water are the key ingredients in getting your basil to thrive no matter where you plant it.",
            "steps": [
                "Purchase a coarse soil from a gardening store. Basil does best in soil that drains well. Soil from your garden or other dense soils may not provide adequate drainage, which can cause the roots of your plant to rot. Also put a few inches of small pebbles at the bottom of your pot can help provide proper drainage and overwatering.",
                "Select a pot that offers sufficient drainage. The pot can be made of clay, plastic, stone, or concrete, but it should have drainage holes in the bottom regardless of the material.",
                "Sterilize your container. Soak the pot in a solution made from water and a mild cleanser. Scrub, and rinse well.",
                "Buy basil seeds. Basil seedlings are fragile and damage easily during the transplanting process. As a result, many gardeners prefer to start the plant from seed.",
                "Fill 3/4 of your container with soil. Allow the soil to remain loose; do not pack it into the container tightly. Tightly packed soil will make it difficult for your basil to take root",
                "Moisten the soil. Do not over-saturate it, but add enough water to make the soil mildly damp.",
                "Sow your seeds.\n\n\nSow a few seeds an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) apart if using a round container.\nScatter seeds along the length of the container if using a long window box. If using this method, you must thin your basil out once seedlings sprout and reach an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) in height.",
                "Cover the seeds with 1/4 inch (6 1/3 millimeters) of fine soil or compost. Do not pack the soil down.",
                "Moisten the soil with a spray bottle. Germination should occur within a week.",
                "Thin your plants out once the seedlings have two pairs of leaves. The plants should be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) apart to ensure adequate room for growth. You can either thin them out by snipping the basil off at soil level or by removing the basil by the root. Since snipping the basil off does not disturb any roots, it is the recommended method if you plan to discard what you remove. If you want to make use of every seedling, however, remove them at the root and transplant them.\n\n\nUse your fingers or a wooden popsicle stick or tongue depressor to carefully dig the soil away from the base of a seedling.\nSlide the tongue depressor under the developing roots or carefully \"wiggle\" the seedling, roots and all, out of the soil with your fingers after it is exposed.\nReplant the removed seedling in another pot or in the same pot 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) away from any other seedling.",
                "Set the container near a sunny window. A south-facing window typically works best. Basil thrives in full sun but needs at least six hours of sunlight a day to grow properly.",
                "Supplement with artificial light. If you cannot provide enough natural sunlight for your basil, use fluorescent grow lights or specially designed high-intensity lights instead. Basil plants receiving no natural light should receive 10 to 12 hours of artificial light.\n\n\nKeep standard fluorescent lights a couple of inches (5 centimeters) away from the tops of your plants, and keep high output and compact fluorescent lamps 1 foot (30 centimeters) above the plants.\nHigh-intensity lights should be two to four feet (61 to 122 centimeters) above plants.",
                "Simulate a natural habitat by running a fan. Direct an electric fan toward the plant, allowing it to rustle the leaves for at least two hours a day. Doing this prevents the air around the plant from getting too stagnant.",
                "Check the plant's pH levels once a month. A good pH level is usually between 6.0 and 7.5. Maintain this pH with an organic fertilizer. Since basil is primarily used for culinary purposes, many non-organic fertilizers may pose a potential risk.",
                "Keep the soil moist, but not soaked. Test the dampness by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch (2.5 centimeters) deep. If the soil feels dry even at this depth, lightly water the plant. Careful not to overwater as basil is very susceptible to root rot. Generally do so just until the water begins to leak out of the drainage holes of your pot.",
                "Pinch off the tops of the basil once the seedlings reach six inches (15 centimeters) in height. Pinching the tops off will encourage better leaf growth and will prevent your basil from becoming \"leggy.\"",
                "Cut single leaves for quick, immediate use. Single leaves can be cut at any time without causing damage to the plant.",
                "Cut whole stems above a pair of leaves. Doing so allows new growth to continue, which will preserve your basil plant for a longer stretch of time. Cutting stems just below a pair of leaves may prevent the stem from growing further.",
                "Harvest stems from mature plants weekly. Frequent harvesting encourages greater leaf growth."

        "How to Remove Grease from Clothes": {
            "intro": "Grease stains are easy to come by, but hard to get out. If you're frustrated of having the mis-coloured splotches smattered across your clothing, try a few different methods of removal. Whether your stains are fresh or set-in, there are several different ways of getting them out.",
            "steps": [
                "Try dish detergent. The best and simplest way to remove anything oily or greasy from any fabric is by generously applying a concentrated dish detergent directly to the stain. It contains no harsh chemicals so you don't have to worry about it damaging the fabric. Dish detergent is formulated to cut through grease plain and simple. Using a small brush (old toothbrushes work great!) scrub the stain in a circular motion for several minutes. Keep pouring on the detergent if needed. Allow the fabric to rest for 30 minutes or so at least before placing in the washing machine. Wash in warm water on heavy duty cycle. This method uses only one ingredient and works wonderfully!",
                "Pour on some baby powder. As soon as you’re able, pour a small amount of baby powder all over the fresh grease stains on your clothing. The baby powder is fine enough that it will fill in the crevices between the fibers, and absorb the grease. Leave the baby powder to ‘soak’ for 10-15 minutes, and then brush it off. If the grease is still faintly visible, toss it in the washing machine under cold water. The combination should do the trick, and by the time the clothing has dried, there should be no trace of grease left!",
                "Rub some chalk on it. Because chalk is such a fine powder, it easily absorbs the grease in your clothes and makes it easy to remove. Fill in your grease stain with plain white chalk, or scrape some of the powder over the stain. Allow it to set for 10-15 minutes and then rub it off. If the stain is still visible, you can wash it with cold water. The rinse/dry cycle will finish the task and should fully remove the stain.",
                "Cover it up with cornstarch. Yes, another one of the fine powders (just like baby powder and chalk), cornstarch works wonders at soaking up fresh grease and oil stains. Pour a small amount of the powder on the stain and allow it to set for a quarter of an hour. You can brush off the cornstarch afterwards, or leave it on and put it in the washing machine. Wash your clothes on ‘cold’, and your grease stain should be gone!",
                "Pour on some talcum powder. Don’t have any of the aforementioned powders on hand? Try using talcum powder to remove the stains. Follow the same process as explained above by pouring a small amount of the powder onto the grease stain, and allowing it to soak for 10-15 minutes. When it’s had a bit of time to soak up the grease, throw the clothing into the washing machine and wash it on ‘cold’.",
                "Make a salt and rubbing alcohol solution. This solution works best for stains on thicker fabrics, such as denim or linen. Mix together one part salt with three parts rubbing alcohol, and then pour it onto the grease stain. Use a soft cloth to rub the mixture into the stain, working it into the fibers. Allow the solution to soak for 10-15 minutes, and then wash your clothing as you normally would. By the time the clothing has been washed and dried, their should be a missing grease spot![1]",
                "Use some dish soap. There’s a reason they use dish soap to clean up oil spills - they are great at dissolving tough oil stains. Find a dish soap that is used for the purpose of dissolving oil (these often have a special type of oil-eating bacteria as an ingredient). Cover the grease stain with the dish soap, and rub it in gently with a soft cloth. Then, throw your clothing into the washing machine and run it under the normal settings. Your clothing should be grease-free after a single wash, but you can repeat the process again if it’s not.[2]",
                "Use a dry cleaning solvent. If you’re up for spending a few bucks, pick up a specialty dry cleaning solution used for cleaning up grease stains. These are typically spray-on or iron-on liquids that are applied directly to the stain prior to washing. Because they are dry-cleaning grade, they should work out the stains almost immediately, making your clothing look good-as-new.[3]",
                "Spray on some hairspray. Believe it or not, hairspray can actually work to remove set-in grease stains. Heavily douse your grease stain with hairspray, using a paper towel in between the fabric and the spray. Allow it to soak for thirty minutes, and then put it in the washing machine for a regular wash. Air-dry your clothes when finished in the washing machine, and you should be good to go! If this process doesn’t work the first time, you can repeat it until the stain is totally removed.",
                "Smear on some cheese-whiz. Granted, this does sound a little gross. However, cheese-whiz is a sworn-upon grease remover by some. Coat your grease stain in a thick layer of cheese whiz, and then rub it in with your finger and put it in the washing machine. A single wash should be enough to get out the stain - and the whiz.",
                "Try using shampoo. Shampoo is used for getting the natural oils and grease out of your hair and scalp, so why not use it for the same process on your clothing? Pour shampoo directly onto your stain, and use a cloth to vigorously rub it in. Let it set for 10-15 minutes, and then wash it as you would regularly in the washing machine. Allow the clothing to air-dry, and you should be grease stain free.",
                "Use waterless mechanic’s soap. Waterless mechanic’s soap - a type of powder detergent - is used in garages all over the world to remove oil from the hands of greasy mechanics. Pour the powder onto the stain, and then rub it vigorously into the oil stain. Let it set for thirty minutes, and repeat the process. Wash the clothing and allow it to air dry; if the stain still persists, repeat the aforementioned process again until it has been fully removed.",
                "Try simple green. Simple green is a cleaning solution used by many for regular household cleaning tasks. However, it also works to remove set-in stains. Pour the liquid directly onto the stain and let it set for 15-20 minutes, adding more if necessary. Then wash your clothing on a cold water cycle, and air dry it.",
                "Use a bit of WD-40. WD-40 is used for a multitude of cleaning purposes, including oil and grease stain removal. Pour the cleaner onto the stain and wait for 30 minutes, allowing it to soak in. You should wash your clothes immediately after letting it soak, washing it with cold water and then air drying it when complete. Repeat this multiple times if necessary to completely remove the stain.",
                "Pour on cola. It’s been known for quite a while that cola sodas have some amazing cleaning qualities, as a result of their ability to dissolve nearly anything. Although you may fear for furthering your stain, colas can remove set in grease stains. Pour it directly onto the stain, and leave it to soak for 1-2 hours (this isn’t long enough for the soda to stain). Follow this up with a wash in the washing machine and an air dry, and you’re finished.",
                "Try using aloe vera. If you’re having trouble scrubbing out an oil stain, you can try aloe vera gel on it. Soak your clothing in cool water, and then pour aloe vera (100% aloe vera gel is best) onto the stain. Rub the gel into the stained spot vigorously for a few minutes, and then wash your clothing with cold water.",
                "Use Lestoil. Another multi-purpose cleaning solution, Lestoil is perfect for removing oil stains (it’s practically in the name). Pour the Lestoil directly onto the stain so that it may soak in for 20-30 minutes. Then, wash your article of clothing in the washing machine with cold water. If you’re removing oil from multiple articles of clothing at once, you can add the lestoil directly to the washing machine with the detergent.[4]"

        "How to Become a Genetic Counselor": {
            "intro": "Genetic counselors work with patients to assess the risks of hereditary disease and medical conditions. A counselor analyzes and interprets data from medical histories and testing to identify the risk of a genetic condition. In addition to providing genetic testing, the counselor educates and counsels clients with risk factors on their medical history. This is a new and fast-growing field with great job prospects if you enjoy working on the cutting edge of medical science and helping patients with a variety of medical concerns.",
            "steps": [
                "Prepare while in high school. High school is a bit away from actually getting a job as a genetic counselor. There are, however, certain steps you can take to prepare you for what comes next.[1]\n\nTake as many classes as you can in sciences like biology and chemistry. If your school offers Advanced Placement classes, take them and do the best you can on the exams.\nLearn more about genetics on your own. Read other books on genetics and read news articles both in papers and online about advances in the field. Genetics is a growing and rapidly changing field, and your classes may not be as up-to-date as you would like.\nLook for volunteer positions as health clinics and genetics labs. Try to shadow a genetic counselor if you can.\nWhen applying to college, look for schools that have strong programs in genetics, biology, and psychology. These can give you an advantage when applying to masters programs down the road.\nFor help with any of this, talk to your guidance counselor about classes to take and outside opportunities to consider. He or she can help you plan out your high school career to get the most experience you can before college.",
                "Get a bachelors degree. Becoming a genetics counselor requires an advanced degree, but before that you need a bachelors degree. The most common major fields include the medical sciences, psychology, and healthcare.[2]\n\nIf you do not major in one of those fields, you should at least have completed undergraduate coursework in the fields of biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, statistics, and psychology.[3]",
                "Volunteer for practical clinical experience. Graduate programs in genetic counseling will want to see practical experience in the field of counseling or genetics to go with your strong science grades. Look for opportunities to volunteer at clinics and shadow current counselors to make yourself a more attractive candidate, and see how much you really want to do the job.[4]\n\nLook for volunteering opportunities with counseling groups. Support groups for terminal illness, disabilities or special needs, or peer counseling are all good experiences you can get in counseling. Volunteering to be a listener for a distress or suicide hotline is another good idea, and an experience that is very desirable to masters programs. Not only will these all look good when you apply to graduate school, they will give you the opportunity to help people directly.[5]\n\nYou can also consider shadowing a current genetic counselor. Try to find a local genetic clinic and ask if you can shadow one of the counselors. You may also be able to volunteer directly with the clinic for some more hands-on experience, depending on the clinic’s needs.[6]\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask your teachers, professors, and guidance counselors if they know of any other opportunities for shadowing or volunteering in genetics work.",
                "Earn a masters degree in genetic counseling. Genetic counselor is a masters-level position, so you will need to be accepted into an accredited masters program. Your masters program will involve coursework dealing with the study of genetics and counseling techniques. You will also do fieldwork where you spend time working directly in a professional setting, probably during the summer. You will finish the program with a thesis or “capstone” project that should involve original research in the field that draws on the information you have learned in classes.[7][8]\n\nAdmissions requirements vary between programs, but in most cases you will need to have good grades in your undergraduate science classes, get a high score on the GRE, and have some practical experience.[9]\n\nAs of 2016, there are 35 programs in the United States and Canada accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling. A full list of the programs is available on their website.[10]\n\nYou do not need to apply right as you finish your undergraduate degree. Taking some time between finishing your bachelors degree and applying for a masters program can be a good opportunity to get some volunteering or practical experience.",
                "Develop a good knowledge of genomics. The centerpiece of your work will be studying and examining genetic science. Through work in high school, college, and post-graduate settings, you will study the field and develop a strong body of knowledge. Beyond this coursework, you should continue reading news articles and other sources for new developments in the field. The more you know, the more you will be able to provide good advice to your patients.",
                "Become a good listener. In addition to learning about genetics, you will need to be comfortable in the role of a counselor. You should enjoy being compassionate and a good listener. Make sure you are prepared to give your patients your full attention when they talk to you, stay focused on the issues or symptoms they describe.[11][12]\n\nUse positive and welcoming body language when patients speak with you. Lean slightly forward to let them know you are listening. Make eye contact and nod occasionally as they talk to keep your focus on them.",
                "Be compassionate. Genetic counselors who work with people directly will need to be comfortable having difficult conversations about pre-existing genetic conditions or possible genetic disorders. You will need to be able to be compassionate and enjoy helping people work through their concerns and difficulties.[13]",
                "Develop your skills of persuasion. There are a number of misconceptions about genetic testing, and you will probably need to convince patients of the benefits of getting tested. You will also need to be familiar with the testing process, to help alleviate any fears people may have.[14]\n\nRemain calm and confident. Part of being persuasive is the ability to alleviate your patient’s concerns. You can do this best by not getting angry or upset if they have questions, but calmly showing that you know what you are talking about, and that you are sure it is the right decision.\nBody language is another key to building a rapport and letting your patient know you can be trusted. Match your patient’s positions and mirror his actions as a way to subtly suggest you are both on the same page. Simple motions like crossing your legs like he does, or putting your arms in a similar position should be enough.[15]\n\nAs you work with patients, you will probably encounter many of the same concerns and misconceptions. Develop some basic responses to these common issues, so you are always ready. There may be additional questions, but at least you will have something to start with.",
                "Get certification from the American Board of Genetic Counseling (ABGC). The ABGC promotes the growth of genetic counseling, and helps to set high standards for the profession. Once you have finished your masters program, you will need to pass the board’s examination to become a certified counselor.[16]\n\nThe exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions, and you will have 4 hours to complete it. The questions cover specific knowledge of genetics and your ability to address problems and situations that you may encounter while counseling. The ABGC provides content outlines and practice exams to help you prepare.\nYour certification will be valid for 5 years after passing the exam. You will need to recertify at that point. This involves having taken a series of continuing education courses and paying recertification fees.[17]",
                "Meet state licensing requirements. Some states require genetic counselors obtain a license to practice counseling in the state. Licensure ensures the genetic counselor meets the minimum education requirements to work in the position. Make sure you know the rules and regulations in your state, and have filled out the proper forms to receive a license.\n\n\nIn Ohio, for example, a state license requires that you hold the proper masters degree, undergo a background check, and provide three recommendation certificates, including one from your current employer.\nAs of February 2016, 18 states require licensure for genetics counselors including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington. In addition, Hawaii, Idaho, and Virginia are considering licensing laws.[18]",
                "Figure out the setting you want to work in. Genetic counselors work in a variety of settings. These include clinical practices in doctors’ offices and hospitals, or doing research for biotechnology companies, government agencies, or university laboratories.[19]\n\nPatient-focused counseling. This will involve working directly with people, and discussing their needs and concerns. You can choose to work closely different specialties, including pregnant women, children, cancer patients, or heart patients. You will be based in a hospital or doctor’s office.[20]\n\nLaboratory-focused counseling. This will involve creating a research agenda to study different aspects of genetic science. You may be involved in directing and studying clinical trials, or researching genetic conditions. You will work in a lab, either with a genetic research company or a university. This kind of work can be done part-time along with patient-focused work to still work directly with individuals.[21]\n\nCommunity or public health focused counseling. These fields including working for non-profit organizations and government agencies to reach specific groups of people. You may work with Newborn Screening programs or patient support groups to reach people who may not come directly to clinics or hospitals.[22]",
                "Find a job. Depending on the type of work you want to do, look for openings with hospitals, laboratories, clinics, or other places seeking trained genetic counselors. You can find these through regular job sources like newspaper and online advertisement sites, by contacting hospitals and laboratories directly, or by looking through the websites of the ABGC and National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC).[23]\n\nGenetic counseling is a rapidly growing field, so once you are certified and licensed, your job prospects should be very strong. New developments in genetics means that new openings, and even new types of work, are become available. Be prepared to be flexible with the types of genetic work you would like to do, as well as where you might want to live, to maximize your chances of landing a good job.[24]",
                "Participate in other professional activities. In addition to your regular job as a counselor, there are a number of other opportunities to share what you are doing with others. This can be working with other professional counselors, or looking for opportunities to teach the next generation of genetic counselors.\n\n\nPublish articles in professional journals. The most prominent journal for genetic counselors is the Journal of Genetic Counseling, published by the National Society for Genetic Counselors.[25] Another good journal is the American Journal of Human Genetics.[26] These are great opportunities to publish research you might be doing on genetics or counseling people on genetic disorders.\nJoin professional societies. In addition to being part of the ABGC, consider joining other professional organizations. The other prominent group in the US is the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Others include the American Society of Human Genetics, the Genetics Society of America, or the International Genetics Education Network. The best one to join will depend on the kind of work you do as a counselor.[27]\n\nFind opportunities to teach others. In many cases, teaching future geneticists will involve introducing students to the basic science of genetics, and understanding how it fits into broader sciences like biology.[28] If you are interested in teaching genetic counseling in a masters program, you will need to earn a doctorate in genetics, neuroscience, biology, or a similar field, and publish peer-reviewed research. You can also be open to allowing future genetic counselors to shadow you to help give them professional opportunities.",
                "Take continuing education courses. To maintain your certification with ABGC, you will need at least 25 hours of continuing education credits. Some states require additional credits as part of maintaining the state license, while certain hospitals and laboratories may want them as a condition for maintaining employment.[29]\n\nApproved courses are available through the ABGC and NSGC, and cover new developments in the fields of genetics and patient care. Available courses will depend on your current job status as well as the type of information you are looking to cover.[30]\n\nIn addition, professional activities including scholarly publications, teaching, public outreach, and peer supervision can qualify as part of your continuing education.[31]\n\nBecause genetics is a field undergoing rapid development, it is important that you keep up with new trends and ideas to give your patients the best care possible. Failing to do so will prevent you from being able to maintain your certification and advancing in your career."

        "wikiHow to Write a Young Adult Novel": {
            "intro": "Young adult fiction is one of the most rapidly expanding and exciting categories in which you you can write and publish. Although many people think young adult novels are only written for teenagers, they have a much broader audience and appeal. While engaging a young adult audience can be a challenge, you can make your novel a success by avoiding common mistakes, planning your novel carefully, and adapting your writing style.",
            "steps": [
                "Ditch the idea that young adult is a genre. Although bookstores and publishers use the phrase young adult as a marketing category, it is not necessarily a genre. A young adult novel could represent any genre such as science fiction, mystery, horror, romance, historical fiction, or fantasy.[1][2]\n\nThis is one aspect of writing young adult fiction that many authors find appealing. You are not restricted to one specific genre, and instead can write books in different genres or books that cross genres.",
                "Don’t make the mistake of thinking that young adult novels are easier to write. Writing any type of book requires hard work, and young adult novels are no exception. Many writers have also reported that these books can be more challenging to write because young adults can be picky readers and are looking for very authentic and original stories.[3]\n\nWriting a young adult novel can be especially difficult if you are no longer considered a young adult. It’s hard to find a voice and adopt a tone that young adults can relate to.\nAlso, keep in mind that many novels that end up being marketed as young adult books or are popular among young adults, were not necessarily written with that intent.[4]",
                "Stop dumbing down your writing. Unfortunately, some people believe that young adults novels are watered down or dumbed down versions of adult fiction. Just because the protagonist in the novel is a young adult does not mean you should feel like you are writing for children.[5][6][7]\n\nWhile your prose and the quality of your writing should be engaging, your readers don't want something simplistic. Young adults want to be treated like adults and you may alienate your audience if you use writing that is too simple or childish.\nAlso, remember that many adults read and enjoy books that fall in the young adult category. Think about how many adults read series such as Harry Potter or the Hunger Games. If your writing and content are too basic and elementary, you will lose this group as potential readers.",
                "Tackle dark, serious, or edgy topics. Many people mistakenly assume that young adult novels should be light and breezy, with no exploration of difficult subject matter. Successful young adult authors, however, are ones willing to address and examine how serious issues in our society affect young adults.[8][9]\n\nThese topics may include, but are not limited to: abuse, sex, gender identity, drugs, rape, incest, suicide, racism, discrimination, violence, and genocide.",
                "Don’t just make things up. While creativity is encouraged in young adult fiction, don’t assume you can make things up and get away with it. If you are talking about or referring to real people, places, events, or products, you need to do your homework.[10]\n\nYoung adults are savvy readers and can easily sniff out uninformed and inaccurate descriptions, opinions, and details. For example, if you are writing a book that talks about video game culture, get the details about the games and the culture of this community right.",
                "Get excited. To write a young adult novel, you need to feel excited about the opportunities of writing in this category. Here are some things to keep in mind:[11][12]\n\nThe field of young adult fiction is expanding.\nAuthors often find that they face fewer restrictions about what they write about because young adults celebrate creativity and imagination.\nYoung adults can also be a more open-minded and supportive audience.\nPeople outside the young adult range will likely read and enjoy your book.\nAs an author of young adult novels, you have the opportunity to write a book that makes an impact on someone and influences how he or she looks at the world.",
                "Study young adult novels. If you want to write young adult books, reading successful young adult novels is an excellent way to start.[13]\n\nPay close attention to the structure, dialogue, plot, and character development.\nMake notes about any ideas you come up with for your novel while reading other books.",
                "Focus on developing your characters. Interesting and engaging characters are essential for a young adult novel. Spend time thinking about and developing your characters before you sit down to write or move on to other parts of the novel such as the plot or setting.[14]\n\nFor each character you create, make a list of his or her history, background, hobbies, relationships, tastes, and personality traits. Although not all of these details will make it in to the book, you will develop well-rounded, and three-dimensional characters that young adults can relate to.\nDon't neglect the villains or minor characters in your story. You never know what details you might need or the changes you will make to your plot.",
                "Research the setting. Now that you’ve developed a full cast of characters, you probably have a better idea of where and when your story will take place. Spend time thinking about the setting of your novel and conduct any research on the time period or location that inspires you.[15]\n\nRemember, you are not limited to present-day or real-world locations. Many successful young adult novels take place in the genres of fantasy and science fiction. There is also a healthy market for historical fiction.",
                "Identify the source of conflict in your novel. The characters in every novel confront some kind of conflict, and this holds true for young adult books. While the specific conflict will be shaped by your characters, setting, and genre, the characters need to confront issues that your audience can relate to.[16]\n\nWith young adults, conflicts and struggles often arise over love, relationships, personal freedom, peer or family pressure, a search for identity, taking on new roles and responsibilities, and dealing with high school, college, and career choices.",
                "Be aware of length. While young adults can be voracious readers, you will lose some potential audience members if your book is too long. Although many young adult novels exceed this limit, most books in this category are between 50,000 to 70,000 words.[17][18]\n\nThe pacing in young adult novels is often fast, with lots of dialogue. Some people think they resemble extended screenplays as opposed to a longer, slower, adult novel.[19]\n\nRemember, if the book or story you are crafting seems much longer than this, you can always contemplate breaking it up into separate books and creating a series.",
                "Ask young adults for their feedback. You want your book to be as successful as possible and appeal to the intended audience, so it’s a smart move to ask young adults to provide feedback on your work.[20]\n\nIf you are no longer a young adult, but are writing a young adult novel, this exercise can help you gain insight into the language, feelings, and concerns of your audience. You will also be better able to recall what it feels like to be a teenager.",
                "Think like a young adult. Regardless of your age, you will have to think like a young adult and try to get in your characters’ mindset in order to craft a novel that is believable and relatable to a young adult audience.[21]\n\nPay careful attention to how you narrate the book so you do not seem to be writing this from the perspective of an adult looking back on their teenage years with the wisdom and maturity that comes with age.[22]\n\nIf you are no longer a young adult, you will have to be careful about the decisions, feelings, and emotions your characters make. Ask yourself if this is something a young adult would actually do or if your hindsight and experience are making your characters and the story less relatable to a young adult audience.\nIf you are looking for insight into a young adult audience, check out online forums centered around young adult novels. You will get a better sense of the opinions, views, and perspectives of people you want to read and enjoy your work.[23]",
                "Emphasize what it feels like to be a teenager. Although the characters in your young adult novel may be very different from you, readers and writers have argued that successful books are those that capture the emotional experience of being a young adult.[24]\n\nFor example, even though readers may not identify with the specific struggle a main character in a young adult novel is dealing with, they will probably relate to his or her search for identity and meaning in the world.",
                "Be careful with pop culture references and slang. References to pop culture and the use of slang can help you develop your characters and make them more personable, but they can also date your novel and you as an author.[25][26]\n\nMany successful young adult authors recommend using pop culture references and slang sparingly to help you establish the setting and provide specific insight into characters.\nExcessive use of pop culture references and slang, however, may make the novel difficult for readers to understand and relate to in the future. References to technology, for example, quickly become obsolete. Overdoing the pop culture and slang can also distract from the storyline and the novel’s central conflict.\nIf you decide to use pop culture references or slang in your novel, make sure you provide sufficient context that a reader can figure out what you are referring to many years down the road.",
                "Get the voice down. Finding and adopting the right voice for your young adult novel can be daunting. While there are no set rules, many young adult novels are written in the first-person present tense, and are narrated from the perspective of a young person revealing intimate details about his or her life.[27]\n\nMany young adult readers, according to writers and editors, are looking for a story that is told in a personal and accessible way.[28]\n\nAlthough adult characters may be present in the book, the novels usually do not emphasize their perspective and readers often identify most with the main character.[29]",
                "Don’t try to be too elaborate with your writing style. When you start writing your young adult novel, you may feel like you need to be particularly poetic and creative, but many successful young adult writers have reported that people of all ages are attracted to their work because the writing style is more direct, straightforward, and simple.[30]\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you should throw writing and grammar rules out the window, but realize that your audience often communicates more bluntly and to the point. Writing like a snobby philosopher won’t help you craft a compelling novel that young adults and people of all ages can relate to.",
                "Think carefully about the age of your characters. The age of your characters will influence who reads your novel and how they react to it. They may be excited to read a book about a character a few years older, but young adults are usually reluctant to read books about characters younger than they are so make sure your characters’ age is appropriate for your intended audience.[31][32][33]\n\nThe age range of main characters in young adult novels is usually mid to upper teens.\nIf you envisioned a protagonist as younger, you might want to evaluate whether your book is a better fit for a middle-grade audience. The main characters in these books are usually 10 to 12 years old, and the middle-grade demographic is 8 to 12 years old.",
                "Show character growth and development. At their core, most young adult books are coming-of-age stories that trace characters’ transition to adulthood. As a result, young adult authors have to demonstrate how their characters experience personal growth and change over the course of the novel.[34]\n\nThe appeal of coming-of-age stories and personal growth is one of the elements that make young adult books so popular to audiences of all ages. This is something we can all relate to.",
                "Don’t try to preach to your audience. Anyone who has been a young adult or is often around young adults knows that they, just like adults, do not appreciate being told what to do. Avoid writing a novel with the intention of teaching your audience lessons you think are important.[35][36]\n\nIt’s okay for your views and opinions to be apparent in the way you write the novel, but you can usually make your audience think critically about a topic by simply raising a question or introducing an issue. It’s not your responsibility as a writer to provide an answer to the question. Instead, let your audience explore and grapple with the topic on their own time and in their own way.",
                "Embrace a flair for the dramatic. While older adults may dismiss teenagers as overly dramatic and emotional, you will need to embrace this tendency if you want to be a successful young adult author. When you are a young adult, everything that happens to you can seem and feel life-changing and very important.[37][38]\n\nYoung adults, because of how their bodies and brains are developing and changing, feel things intensely. To capture that quality, you have to be able to dramatize things that some people might regard as trivial in your book. For example, a grade on a science test, a glance from a boy you are attracted to, and a snicker in gym class can seem incredibly important to young adults.[39]",
                "Make the ending somewhat hopeful. While young adult books can definitely explore topics that leave readers feeling raw and emotional, successful young adult novels also offer readers some glimpse of optimism or the sense that things can and will improve for the characters. You don’t have to make the ending a happy or rosy one, and tragedy can occur in the book. Just try to leave readers with a sense that there is some chance for survival, growth, and happiness.[40][41]\n\nOne of the reasons many adults are drawn to young adult novels is that they often provide more resolution or a reason for optimism than adult fiction.\nFor example, if you are writing a book about a geeky student in high school, you don’t have to include a triumphant but unrealistic ending where the nerd turns into the most popular student in school. You can, however, suggest that the unpopular student meets and befriends new people, feeling less isolated in the end."

        "How to Get Rid of Chapped Lips Without Lip Balm": {
            "intro": "If your lips are chapped, you may want to avoid the artificial ingredients in certain lip balms, and with good reason. The fragrances, artificial colors, and soothing agents they contain can irritate your lips and actually make them worse.[1] Or maybe you don’t have any lip balm around and want relief without running to the store. Never fear! You can soothe and heal your lips naturally by avoiding irritants, taking simple measures to keep them protected, and by applying natural moisturizers and soothing agents.",
            "steps": [
                "Don’t lick your lips. Licking your lips does temporarily add moisture, but at a cost. Your saliva will irritate your lips while constant licking will also remove the natural oils that protect them and hold in moisture.[2]",
                "Breathe through your nose. The more you breathe through your mouth, the drier your lips will become.[3] This means that if you have a cold as well as chapped lips, a decongestant can do wonders for both.",
                "Don’t pick off flakes of dead skin. Instead, soften them with emollient oils such as coconut oil or almond oil and let them fall off naturally. Pulling them off too early will expose raw, painful skin.[4]",
                "Don’t eat acidic, salty, or spicy foods. All of the above can further irritate your already damaged lips. In particular, be sure to avoid:[5]\n\nCitrus like grapefruit or orange juice\nPopcorn or nuts\nHot wings or salsa",
                "Get rid of toothpaste with synthetic flavors like spearmint and peppermint and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Both can cause allergic reactions that aggravate already irritated skin. Check here for a list of SLS-free toothpastes.[6]",
                "Avoid excessive exposure to the sun. Sun and wind are the two main causes of chapped lips. If your lips are damaged, more sunshine will only make them worse, especially since sunscreen is not recommended for chapped lips, as it may irritate them.[7]",
                "Stay out of harsh weather. Windy, dry weather can quickly dry out and crack your lips. You’ll want to stay indoors as much as possible to give your lips a chance to heal.",
                "Rub petroleum jelly or beeswax on your lips. These are the two main treatments suggested by the National Institute of Health.[8] Beeswax contains propolis, which is an anti-inflammatory that aids in healing.[9] Petroleum jelly is an emollient that moisturizes and protects lips.",
                "Place or rub sliced cucumber on your lips for five minutes. Cucumber has been shown to be a very effective moisturizer due to the presence of vitamin B-5,[10] and it also soothes skin and reduces inflammation.[11]\n\nAlternately, you can apply cucumber juice to your lips several times a day.[12]",
                "Use almond oil or coconut oil in place of lip balm. Both are emollients that keep skin moist and flexible. Both also have anti-inflammatory properties.[13] In addition, coconut promotes healing, reduces the risk of infection, and reduces pain, making it a great treatment for chapped lips.[14]\n\nOther oils used to treat chapped lips are olive oil, jojoba oil, canola, and mustard oil. All have moisturizing and protective properties though their healing properties are not as pronounced as almond and coconut oil.",
                "Rub cocoa or shea butter on your lips. Both have emollient and anti-inflammatory properties. They will trap moisture and protect your lips. Cocoa and shea butter also contain antioxidants that will help prevent further damage to your lips from the sun.[15][16]",
                "Put drops of milk cream on your lips. The fat content of milk cream makes it effective at moisturizing your lips though it does not have the same anti-inflammatory and healing properties as some oils and kinds of butter. Still, if you don’t have the right oils or butter to hand, it can help. Let it sit on your lips for ten minutes, then wash it off with lukewarm water.",
                "Apply aloe vera to your lips. You can purchase aloe vera at a store, or purchase an aloe vera plant, break off a leaf, and squeeze some out. Aloe vera is an anti-inflammatory that also promotes skin healing.[17] However, some doctors feel that it can irritate lips that are very cracked, so use it with caution.",
                "Consume vitamins E and C. When taken together, vitamins E and C help promote healing of damaged skin, particularly if your lips are chapped due to sunburn.\n\n\nSome beauty sites suggest applying vitamin E oil directly to your lips, but some doctors warn that vitamin E can irritate chapped lips.[18]",
                "Use a humidifier at night. Keeping your room moist will help to prevent your lips from drying out any further. This is especially important when your air conditioning and heat are running a lot, as both may dry out the air in the room where you sleep.[19]",
                "Drink plenty of water. Dehydration is one of the main causes of chapped lips. This is particularly true in the winter when many people drink less water. If your lips are chapped, try to drink at least ten 8-oz cups of fluid a day to stay hydrated.[20]",
                "Skip the lipstick, or if you do use it, make sure it is moisturizing. Alternately, you can rub a moisturizing and protective oil on your lips before applying lip stick.[21] Or try a lip balm that contains an SPF of at least 15.",
                "Wear a scarf over your mouth when outside. The wind can cause chapped lips, and it can aggravate already chapped lips by stripping them of moisture. Putting a scarf over you mouth when outside gives your lips a chance to heal.[22]"

        "How to Become a Lender": {
            "intro": "Some consumers or individuals with spare capital tend to follow the old axiom \"neither a borrower nor a lender be,\" but others are looking at how to cash in on lending. Seeing how much income banks and major lenders make from their loans is enough to get some individual cash or asset holders interested in lending out some of their money, hoping to make good gains in interest payments over time. A combination of economic incentives and new technology allows more people to effectively become a lender and get some good returns on money that they currently have parked in low interest bank accounts.",
            "steps": [
                "Collect your capital. For the best results, you'll want all of your lendable money to be collected in one central account or \"pot.\" This will also help you to figure out how much you can lend without negatively impacting your own household budget.\n\n\nIt's best to plan for a worst-case scenario where you only lend money that you can live without, in case a loan does not get repaid.",
                "Understand your loan goals. Before you get into actually lending out money, you'll want to look at several factors including how long you want that money to be tied up, and how much you plan to make with it. This will help you narrow down lending choices further on in the process.",
                "Look at the tax burden. The plain fact that experienced money handlers understand is that every investment has a tax burden, and lending is no exception. As a personal taxpayer, you will have to pay taxes on income from interest payments, which will be taken out of your gross gains, or yield. It's incumbent on you as the lender to figure out how this will affect your future tax bills.",
                "Research micro lending. For almost all individual would-be lenders, the best way to effective lending is through Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) that help small lenders find interested borrowers. Take a look at these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.[1]\n\nPopular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.\nSome of the reasons people are looking to borrow through micro loans include:[2]\nPay off credit cards at a lower interest rate\nStart a small business or expand an existing one\nFinance a creative project such as a film, music or artwork\nFinance a wedding, car repair or consolidate other loans",
                "Evaluate how micro lending sites rate borrowers. In a similar method as the ones used by big lenders, micro-lending sites often \"rate\" borrowers according to answers they give on a questionnaire. This way lenders can match borrowers that meet their desired level of risk. Generally, you'll be picking a \"basket\" of loans and betting that the majority of them will not default, or in other words, be unable to repay.\n\n\nRiskier borrowers will be charged a higher interest rate.",
                "Make the deal. When you have your desired loan recipients picked out, you should be able to seal the deal on micro lending sites using their proprietary tools and paperwork. When these are all finished, you will actually be a lender, able to collect income payments to boost your total investment portfolio.",
                "Consider a lending club. Rather than loaning money to a single borrower, in a lending club you invest in notes, or $25 portions. This way your investment is spread across hundreds of loans, while the borrowers' loans are funded by many different investors.[3]",
                "Evaluate the benefits of micro lending. The main benefit of micro lending is returns on your investments ranging from 5-9%. This is much higher than you would get on a savings or money market account. These returns take into consideration a 4-5% default rate and 1% in fees from the micro lending company.\n\n[4]\nMicro loans are not tied into the stock market, so even if the market plunges you should still get a good return on your investment.[5]",
                "Evaluate the risks of micro lending. Borrowers may default on the loans. This type of loan is not secured by a house or other collateral that a bank would normally require. Borrowers can also file for bankruptcy and you would lose your investment.[6]",
                "Consider an automated investing tool. Rather than choosing individual borrowers that can become very time consuming, you can arrange for automated investing. You select a mix of loan grades according to borrower risk and set the amount for each loan. Then the tool will automatically invest in loans for you and send a daily report online.[7]"

        "How to Heal after Arthroscopic Knee Surgery": {
            "intro": "Arthroscopic knee surgery is the most commonly performed orthopedic (joint) procedure in the United States. [1] During the relatively quick procedure, the inside of the knee joint is cleaned up and mended with the aid of a pencil-sized camera, which allows for a more accurate diagnosis. Due to the small incision and reduced damage to surrounding muscles, tendons and ligaments, healing time after arthroscopic surgery is generally less than conventional open-knee surgery.[2] However, there's still a fairly rigorous post-op recovery routine to follow if you expect to fully heal from arthroscopic knee surgery.",
            "steps": [
                "Listen to your surgeon's instructions. Following your arthroscopic knee surgery, it's important to do what your doctor thinks is most appropriate for the best possible recovery. Your knee may not end up being perfect, but following specific advice about controlling inflammation and pain, as well as stimulating healing, will lead to the best outcome for your particular injury.\n\n\nAlmost all arthroscopic knee surgery is done on an outpatient basis and lasts only a few hours at most.[3] Arthroscopy can be performed under local, regional, or general anesthesia, which prevents you from feeling pain during the surgery.\nThe most common conditions that warrant arthroscopy of the knee are: torn meniscus cartilage, pieces of cartilage within the joint space (known as \"joint mice\"), torn or damaged ligaments, chronically inflamed joint lining (called synovium), misaligned kneecap (patella) or removal of cysts behind the knee.[4]",
                "Take medications as directed. Your doctor will recommend medications mainly to control pain and inflammation, but possibly also to deter infections and/or blood clots depending on your diagnosis, age and overall health condition. Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of stomach ulcers.[5]\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin help you deal with inflammation and pain.\nAnalgesics such as opioids, diclofenac and acetaminophen help you to get relief from pain, but not inflammation.\nAntibiotics are prescribed to prevent infections, whereas anticoagulants prevent blood clots.",
                "Elevate your leg while resting. To help prevent inflammation in your knee naturally, elevate your leg higher than your heart level by using pillows to support the leg while you rest. This will help blood and lymph fluid return into circulation as opposed to collecting in your lower leg or knee. It's easier to elevate your leg while lying on the couch instead of sitting in a chair.\n\n\nTotal bed rest is not a good idea for any type of musculoskeletal injury because some movement (even just limping around the house) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. As such, some rest is good, but complete inactivity is counterproductive.",
                "Apply ice around your knee. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries because it restricts blood vessels (reducing inflammation) and numbs nerve fibers (reducing pain).[6] Cold therapy should be applied above and around the scar from the operation for about 15 minutes every 2-3 hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.\n\n\nCompressing the ice against your knee with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation and limit swelling.\nAlways wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.",
                "Maintain proper dressage care. You will leave the hospital with a sanitized dressing covering your knee, which will absorb any blood that leaks from the wound. Your surgeon will tell you when you can shower or bathe, and when you should change the dressing in order to reduce the likelihood of infection.[7] The main intention is to keep the surgical incision clean and dry. Using some antiseptic solution on the wound as you change the bandage is a good idea.\n\n\nIn most cases, you'll be able to fully wash your body about 48 hours after surgery.\nCommon antiseptic solutions include iodine, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.\nCheck with your surgeon before applying anything to the wound. For example, iodine can impede wound healing and has fallen out of favor with some surgeons",
                "Beware of signs of infection. Signs of infection post-surgery include: increased pain and swelling near the incision, drainage of pus and/or red streaks extending from the affected area, fever and lethargy. If any of these signs manifest, then see your doctor immediately.\n\n\nYour doctor will treat your infection with systemic antibiotics and local antiseptic solutions.\nIn more extreme cases, your infected wound may have to be drained of the pus and fluid.",
                "Take it easy during the first few days. Arthroscopic surgery may alleviate most of your knee pain almost immediately, but be very careful and resist the urge to participate in any strenuous activity during the first few days or so to allow for healing. Any exercise during the first few days post surgery should be very mild and focused on leg muscle contractions and mobilization without weight bearing, such as slowly raising your leg while lying on your bed or sofa.[8]\n\nAfter a few days, focus on regaining your balance and coordination by putting more weight on your leg, but support yourself with a chair or against the wall in case you lose your balance.\nComplete inactivity (such as bed rest) is not recommended post surgery — muscles and joints need to move and get ample blood flow in order to heal.",
                "Use crutches. Most likely you'll need to take some time off from your job, especially if it involves much standing, walking, driving or lifting. Recovery from simple arthroscopic procedures is usually relatively fast (a few weeks), but you may need to use crutches during that time.[9] If parts of your knee have been repaired or rebuilt, you may not be able to walk without crutches or a knee brace for several weeks, and full recovery may take several months to a year.\n\n\nMake sure to get your crutches fit to your height, otherwise you might develop a shoulder injury.",
                "Alter your routine at work. If you have a physical job, then talk to your boss about switching to something less demanding, if possible. For example, maybe you can do something more sedentary at the office or work from home on the computer. Even driving is typically restricted from 1-3 weeks after an arthroscopic knee procedure, so merely getting to work might be very difficult.[10]\n\nWhen you'll be able to drive depends on: the knee involved, whether your car is manual or automatic, the nature of the procedure, your level of pain, and whether you are using narcotic pain medications.\nIf your right knee is involved (which is needed to press the gas and brake pedals), expect to be restricted from driving for a longer duration.",
                "Start with non-weight-bearing exercise. After a few days, depending on your pain level, it should be safe to do some exercises while laying on the floor or bed. Regular exercise to restore your knee mobility and strength is necessary, and for the most part, it can be carried out at home.[11] Your orthopedic surgeon may recommend that you exercise your leg for approximately 20-30 minutes, 2-3x daily. Start with muscle contractions around the knee without actually flexing the knee joint very much.\n\n\nContract your hamstring muscles: lay down or sit with your knees bent to about 10 degrees or so; pull your heel against the floor, tightening the muscles in the back of your thigh as you do so; hold for 5 seconds, then relax; repeat 10x.[12]\n\nContract your quadricep muscles: lay on your stomach with a towel rolled under the ankle of your recuperating knee; push your ankle down against the towel roll — your leg should straighten out as much as possible; hold for 5 seconds, then relax; repeat 10x.[13]",
                "Progress to weight bearing exercise. Once you've lightly worked the muscles surrounding the knee with isometric contractions, try some weight bearing ones while standing. As you increase the intensity of your exercising, you may experience some temporary setbacks — if your knee swells up or starts to ache after a particular exercise, stop the activity until your knee settles down.\n\n\nPartial squat while holding onto a chair: hold onto the back of a sturdy chair or countertop with your feet 6-12 inches from the chair or counter. Do not bend all the way down. Keep your back straight and hold for 5-10 seconds. Slowly come back up, relax and repeat 10x.[14]\n\nStanding quadriceps (thigh muscle) stretch: standing with your recuperating knee bent, gently pull your heel toward your butt muscles, which should create a stretch in the front of your leg (thigh). Hold for 5 seconds, relax and repeat 10x.[15]\n\nForward step-ups: step forward and up onto a 6-inch stool, leading with your recuperating leg. Step back down and then repeat 10x. Increase the height of the stool or platform as your leg strength increases.[16]",
                "Progress to weight resistance exercise. The final phase of rehabilitating your knee involves using weight resistance via weight machines or exercise bikes. If you're not accustomed to going to the gym and weight training, then consider the help of a personal trainer or physical therapist. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your knee, and if need be, treat your sore muscles with modalities such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.[17]\n\nRide the stationary bike. Start pedaling for 10 minutes a day with the resistance on the lowest level, then progress to 30 minutes with significantly more resistance.\nTry leg extensions with weights when cleared by your orthopedist. Find the leg extension machine at the gym and select the minimum weight. In a seated position, hook your ankles around the padded protrusions and try to straighten your legs. Hold for a few seconds and slowly lower your legs back down — repeat 10x and gradually increase the weight over the course of a few weeks. Stop the exercise if it is painful and check with your doctor before continuing."

Here are a few questions you can ponder:\n\n\nHave I disobeyed any of the commandments?\nHave I nourished my faith?\nHas anything else in my life influenced me more than God?\nHave I denied or doubted my faith?\nHave I hurt others, either accidentally or purposefully?\nHave I rejected any part of my faith?\nHave I been forgiving?\nWhat are the causes of my sins? What temptations do I surround myself with?",
                "Understand the difference between mortal and venial sin. Most of us commit venial sins on the regular; they're nothing to be ashamed of, though forgiveness should still be sought. These are your everyday sins -- lying to a friend to get out of a party, using God's name in vain, etc. Then there are the mortal sins, which are no laughing matter. Three conditions must be present in order for a sin to be mortal:\n\n\nIt must be something serious\nYou must understand what you're doing at the time you're doing it\nYou must have done it according to your own free will\n\nKeep in mind that whatever it is, your priest will keep your secrets. Whatever it is, he will not (and cannot) pass judgment or let your secrets out. Even under threat of death! He can be trusted. You needn't worry about the consequences of telling him. In fact, neglecting to tell him is a sin in itself!",
                "Find a confession session. This can either be done by dropping in or making a phone call; many churches have designated times for confessions. Though a priest can usually be found at most times with enough looking, going to a scheduled session is easiest. However, a quick phone call or brief meeting and you can schedule a private session as well.\n\n\nIf you're nervous to go into the church, don't be! Many churches have publicized when confession is -- either on a sign outside the church or as part of the church bulletin, which can almost always be found at the entrances. Some are even up online!\nPrivate sessions are a good idea if you have a lot to talk about. A normal confession may last 10 or so minutes. If you think yours will last a lot longer, feel free to ask for a private session.",
                "Pray that you may be honest and repentant. It's always a good idea to do a little prayer before confession to ensure that all goes well, nothing escapes your memory, and to ensure that your penitence is meaningful and true. You want to go in with nothing but the best of intentions.\n\n\nA large part of a good confession is meaning it, is seeking forgiveness, is putting your heart and soul into it. Even if you sat down with the priest and only muttered out an, \"I hurt my friend\" between sobs of regret, that'd be so much better than listing out every sin you've committed since your last confession between eye rolls. It's all about being true and faithful. The act of confession is about contrition -- wholly rejecting sin.",
                "Enter the church and take your seat in a pew. You could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it?\n\n\nTake a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love.",
                "Enter the confessional. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way.\n\n\nMake the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing.\n\nThe Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you.",
                "Follow the priest's lead. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation!\n\n\nDo not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession!",
                "Confess your sins. This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice.\n\n\nYour priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place.",
                "Listen as the priest offers counsel. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:\n\n\nMy God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.\nIn choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,\nI have sinned against You whom I should love\nabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,\nto do penance, to sin no more, and\nto avoid whatever leads me to sin.\nOur Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.\nIn his name, my God, have mercy",
                "Take heed as the priest will then offer absolution and recommend penance. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting!\n\n\nJust to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.",
                "Leave the confessional feeling a little lighter than before. The priest will give you a \"Go in peace to love and serve the Lord,\" or something very similar. Smile, thank him, walk out, and be excited! Your sins have been forgiven and you have a clean slate to work with. You're that much closer to God. Can you feel it? Now what are you going to do with your fresh start?\n\n\nIf you forgot a sin you wished to mention, don't fret. God knows of your intentions and it has been forgiven along with the others. However, you may want to mention it next time. Or it could fester and turn into some unnecessary guilt!",
                "If you wish, return to your pew. Many often choose to return to their pew and resume prayer, offering a silent thanks to God. And if your penance was a select number of certain prayers, there's no better time than now to channel God. So feel free to return to your seat and bookend your reconciliation with prayer.\n\n\nMany reflect on their experiences and how they can avoid the sins in the future. When's the next time you plan on confessing? What can you do in the meantime to find inspiration to live in His image? Harden your resolve now to try to live as He intended.",
                "Complete your penance. Whatever the priest suggested you do for penance is best completed as soon as possible. Whether that's in the pew or a conversation you need to have with a loved one, seek to fulfill His desires as soon as possible. You'll feel so relieved when all is said and done!\n\n\nUpon completion of your penance, you may want to take a moment to thank God and revel in your absolution. Think about how much God loves you and how wonderful it is to be a part of His glory. Not everyone is so lucky!",
                "Pledge to stay aligned with God. It is not expected that you never sin again. God knows that's ridiculous! It's only expected that you seek to avoid the situations that lead you to sin. It's also not wise to view confession as an excuse to sin! No, no, no. Confession is just a part of bringing humanity a bit closer to God, imperfections and all. All He wants is for you to do your best.\n\n\nAs you go about the next days and weeks, keep in mind God's part in your life and how you can strive to live as He desires. Seek out the scriptures for inspiration, and surround yourself with those who yearn to live in similar ways. In other words? Go forth to love and serve the Lord. Your Lord."

        "How to Care for a Cat's Paws": {
            "intro": "Caring for your cat’s paws is an important aspect of her overall care. Your cat needs her paws to be healthy so she can do the things cats like to do, such as scratching and climbing.[1] The more you do to take care of her paws, the healthier and happier she will be, and the stronger your bond will grow with her.",
            "steps": [
                "Massage your cat’s paws. You will be handling your cat’s paws on a regular basis to care for them properly, so she will need to get comfortable with this handling. Gently massaging your cat’s paws is a great way to do this. Pick a time to massage her paws when she is most likely to be relaxed, such as after a meal. Position her comfortably in your lap.[2]\n\nHave some tasty bits of treats on hand so you can reward her for good behavior as you touch her paws. Choose a treat that you will give her only during paw massages.[3]\n\nStart by picking up one paw and gently rubbing the top of it.[4]\n\nHold each paw for about 3 seconds, without squeezing or pinching. If she tries to pull her paw away, keep a gentle hold on the paw and follow the direction of the pull.[5]\n\nWhen she’s more comfortable with you holding her paw, apply gentle pressure to the base of each toe to extend the nail out. This will start getting her ready for nail trims.[6]\n\nHow often you massage your cat’s paws is up to you. Consider making this a daily ritual, which would be great for bonding, or do it only on occasion.\nPaws can be a sensitive area for cats, so your cat may not like you touching her paws at first. If she continues to object, try to hold her paw again, but add in scratching behind her ear and giving her a treat. Leave her paws alone for a while, then repeat these actions. Eventually, she will come to enjoy the paw handling.[7]",
                "Trim your cat’s nails. Trim your cat’s nails once every 10 days to 2 weeks.[8] How much you restrain her for nail trims will depend on her comfort level with the process. If she doesn’t mind you touching her paws, gentle restraint in your lap with your forearm pressed against her body may be sufficient.\n\n\nYou may need to use a cat restraint bag if your cat is likely to scratch or bite.\nMassage her paws first before trimming. Keep in mind that you may not be able to trim all of her nails at once. You may only get to 1 paw per session.[9]\n\nIf your cat uses a scratching post frequently, you may not need to trim her nails that often, since the scratching will keep the nails worn down.[10]\n\nYou may need to acclimate your cat to the sound of clippers. To do this, place a piece of dry spaghetti in your lap as you massage her paws. As you press on her paw pad with one hand to extend a nail, use the clippers to ‘clip’ the spaghetti. Release her toe and give her a treat.[11]",
                "Give your cat a scratching post. Scratching posts are great for keeping your cat's nails naturally trimmed down. They come in several different textures (e.g., sisal, corrugated cardboard) and orientations (e.g., horizontal, vertical).[12][13] Consider having several types of scratching posts for your cat so she will not get bored with just one.\n\n\nDo not be too quick to replace the scratching posts. A scratching post that looks old and worn out to you may be perfect for your cat.[14]",
                "Wipe your cat’s paws. This is important for outdoor and indoor cats. Keeping your cat’s paws clean will prevent her from ingesting debris or household chemicals from her paw pad that could make her sick. Use a damp cloth (preferably warm) to wipe her paws each day.[15]\n\nRegularly cleaning your floors will also help keep your cat’s paws clean.[16]\n\nMake sure to wipe between her toes and around her paw pads.[17]",
                "Examine your cat’s paws. Take some extra time to examine your cat’s paws when you are wiping or massaging them. Check for any abnormalities, such as cuts, scratches, swellings, or splinters. Outdoor cats may be prone to paw injuries, but your indoor cat’s sense of curiosity and exploration could lead to injury as well.[18]\n\nYou can treat minor injuries (e.g., superficial cuts, scrapes, or splinters) yourself, but more serious injuries (e.g., deep cuts, heavy bleeding, abscesses) would require immediate veterinary care.[19]",
                "Trim the long hair on your cat’s paws. If your cat has long hair, the hair in between her toes could become quite bothersome to her. In fact, the hair could become so long that it would affect your cat’s ability to walk normally.[20] Use a small pair of rounded scissors to keep the hair trimmed short.[21]",
                "Organize your supplies. If your cat’s paws have minor injuries (superficial cuts, scrapes, splinters), you can treat them at home. You will need a few supplies, including an antiseptic solution (Betadine), some clean gauze and towels, and tweezers.[22] If you do not have these supplies already, you can purchase them at your local pharmacy.\n\n\nThe antiseptic solution will help prevent infection.[23]\n\nYou will also need some mild soap.",
                "Clean and disinfect the paw. For minor cuts and scrapes, gently wipe the paw with a towel dampened with warm water and soap to remove debris. Place a small amount of the antiseptic solution on some gauze and wipe the paw with the gauze.[24]\n\nWatch your cat’s body language. If she is resistant to you touching her paws, it may not be a good idea to force the issue, especially if you do not have a good way of restraining her. Take her to your veterinarian if you are unable to keep her still enough to treat her paws.",
                "Remove foreign objects with a tweezer. If your cat has a splinter or other small foreign object that is superficially stuck in her paw, you will need a pair of tweezers to remove it. First, disinfect the tweezers with Betadine. Next, clean the affected paw with soap and water, and grasp the object with the tweezers.[25]\n\nWhen you grasp the object, slowly pull it out in the direction of its entry. Keep a firm hold on your cat’s paw as you pull the object out. When the object is out, clean the paw again and apply some antiseptic solution to the paw.[26]\n\nTake your cat to your veterinarian if you are unable to get the object out. If your cat is in a lot of pain, she may not let you have more than 1 attempt with the tweezers.",
                "Wipe your cat’s paws. This is particularly important if you have an outdoor cat. If you have put salt down on your driveway or sidewalk, your outdoor cat could become sick from licking it off her paws.[27] Wipe her feet as you would during other times of year.",
                "Moisturize your cat’s paw pads. Although your cat’s paw pads are excellent at preventing puncture wounds, they are not so good at providing insulation against extreme temperatures.[28] Your cat’s paw pads are especially sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, and can even become dry and cracked because of those temperature extremes.[29] Moisturizing your cat’s paws in the winter and summer is a great way to care for them.\n\n\nApply a fast-absorbing and penetrating emollient, like petroleum jelly, to your cat’s paws 2 to 3 times/week for a few weeks to treat the dryness. Petroleum jelly, which is available at your local pharmacy, can withstand your cat’s licking.[30]\n\nOlive oil is another good moisturizing agent. Cortisone cream and tea tree oil are not recommended for moisturizing cat paw pads.[31]",
                "Keep the hair around your cat's paws short in the winter. In the winter, outdoor cats with long hair could collect snow and ice crystals in the hair around their paws.[32] Not only could this make walking uncomfortable, but the ice crystals could potentially damage the paw pads. Use your small, rounded scissors to keep the hair short during the winter.",
                "Keep your cat away from uncomfortable outdoor surfaces. Concrete can become extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. If your area experiences an ice storm, the ice would be very uncomfortable for your cat to walk on. When there are temperature extremes, try to keep your cat away from surfaces that would lead to paw pad discomfort.[33]\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat, you may need to transition her to staying indoors during the winter."

        "How to Reload a Pistol and Clear Malfunctions": {
            "intro": "Malfunctions (also, erroneously, known as \"jams\") are a way of life in semi-automatic handguns. Though most modern guns are relatively reliable, it is always a good idea to be prepared, because malfunctions seem to happen at the most inopportune times. This article also covers reloading, which is not a malfunction, but is yet another reason why your gun may not fire when you want it to. There are two types of reload situations. One, you've fired all your rounds, and the magazine is empty with the slide or bolt locked back. This is called an Emergency or Normal Reload. The second, is a \"tactical reload\", where rounds have been fired, but the weapon still has only about a round or two in it. You can use this opportunity to drop your nearly empty or empty magazine and load a new one.",
            "steps": [
                "Identify the need. An emergency reload is needed when you have spent all the rounds from your magazine and your slide is locked back.",
                "Grab a fresh magazine (likely from a magazine pouch). This happens after the slide has locked back on an empty magazine.",
                "Move the fresh magazine toward the gun, as you do this...",
                "Eject the empty magazine. Be sure not to lose your old magazine, and bring your new magazine into place below the magazine well. (they should essentially pass each other during the drill).",
                "Insert the magazine. Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force (though there should be little resistance)...",
                "Seat the magazine using the heel of your palm. Give it a light tap, you should feel it click into place.",
                "Roll your hand over the top of the slide and pull it back toward your chest. Be sure not to put your fingers in the slide opening, or anywhere else they might get caught.",
                "Release the slide, so it can go forward with full force. This will seat the next round in the chamber, preparing it for discharge.",
                "Determine if it is safe to perform a tactical reload. Only execute this if you encounter a lull in the gunfight and are able to place yourself behind cover. You know you have spent some rounds from the current magazine and want to prepare for whatever may come next.",
                "Reach to your magazine pouch (or other magazine holder and a pocket maybe; make sure you have a full magazine).",
                "Move back to the gun and eject the partially depleted magazine into your hand.",
                "Put the magazine in your pocket (separate from fresh magazines).",
                "Grab the fresh magazine you touched earlier and insert it into the gun in the same fashion as the emergency reload, but this reload doesn't require manipulation of the slide.",
                "Practice at the range. You should be able to feel and react immediately when the gun does not fire. When you pull the trigger, if you feel a \"click\", execute a malfunction type-1 clearing. If there is no click, look at the malfunction and act accordingly (remember it may be an empty magazine too). After shooting for some time you should be able to feel when the magazine is depleted, allowing you to execute emergency reloads very quickly. Over time you will begin to notice that the weapon will feel and sound different after firing the last round.",
                "Identify the malfunction. Often a type-1 malfunction is a misfeed, in which a round was not loaded into the chamber (e.g. you didn't rack the slide after you loaded a magazine, or the magazine wasn't seated enough to load a round).",
                "Make sure the malfunction is not a \"squib load\". This is a relatively dangerous malfunction where there is not enough force to propel the projectile out of the barrel. In semi-automatic pistols, a squib is often easily noticeable, as the slide will not cycle and a new round will not be chambered. If a squib load happens, remove the magazine and clear the obstruction immediately.",
                "Make sure the malfunction is not a \"hang fire\", in which the burning of the cartridge's propellant is delayed. Only attempt to immediately clear the malfunction during a live-fire, real confrontation. This is due to the risk of the round eventually firing. If you experience a hang fire, keep the firearm pointed down range for at least 10 seconds before attempting to clear.",
                "Correct the Malfunction. The quickest way to do this is through immediate action. With a semi-automatic pistol, pull the slide back, ejecting the last round. Observe the ejection and the round. If the lead is still on the bullet, you know that the round didn't fire. If the lead is gone, it may indicate a weapon malfunction. Observe the chamber. Check for double feeds, or things that don't belong. Release the slide, seating the next round. Deactivate the safety and attempt to fire the weapon. If it still fails to fire, remove the magazine and eject the current round, and turn the weapon over to a gun expert for repair.",
                "Practice:\n\n\nLoad a full magazine into the gun with an empty chamber.\nPoint at the target, pull the trigger, feel the \"click\".\nWith the heel of your palm hit the bottom of your magazine (with some fervor; this is the \"tap\").\nThen twist your gun 90-degrees to the right (so the ejection port is down) and...\nRack the gun by pulling the slide straight back and letting go; do not ride the slide forward, let it slam (this the \"flip\" and \"rack\" part of the drill). This will drop a possibly dud round out of the chamber and load a new round into the chamber.",
                "Identify the malfunction. When you pull the trigger, there is no \"click\" (or \"boom\"). Sticking out the chamber is visible brass. This brass is what gives the type-2 malfunction the name \"the stovepipe\". It is also known as a failure to eject.",
                "Fix the malfunction. The solution is the same as a type-1 malfunction: tap, rack/flip.",
                "Practice:\n\n\nPull back the slide to expose an empty chamber, lock empty brass so it is sticking out of the chamber.\nLoad a full magazine into the gun.\nPoint at the target, pull the trigger, take note that there is no \"click\".\nVisually see the brass sticking out of the chamber.\nWith the heel of your palm hit the bottom of your magazine (with some fervor — this is the \"tap\").\nThen twist your gun 90-degrees to the right (so the ejection port is down) and...\nRack the gun by pulling the slide straight back and letting go; do not ride the slide forward, let it slam (this is the \"flip\" and \"rack\" part of the drill). This will drop the brass out of the chamber and load a new round into the chamber.",
                "Identify the malfunction. The fired casing does not get pulled out of the chamber and a new round has now being loaded into the breech. This is known as a double-feed and a failure to extract.",
                "Fix the malfunction:\n\n\nGrab the slide and Lock it back (optional)\nPress the magazine release and (while your magazine may fall out on its own normally, a type-3 will prevent it from doing so now) strip the magazine from the gun.\nYou have an option here. Either you drop the magazine, or practice retention where you hold onto the magazine to continue to use it.\nGrab the slide again and rack it hard three times.\nReach for a fresh magazine (or use the one in retention), put it in the gun (same as the tactical reload) #*Rack the slide one more time to load a round into the chamber."

        "wikiHow to Reduce Your Overall Body Fat": {
            "intro": "Reducing your overall body fat may help improve your health. While some body fat is essential to the healthy functioning of your body, large amounts of excess body fat can lead to serious health problems. Too much fat in the body is connected to many health conditions such as sleep apnea, high blood pressure or heart disease and hardening of the arteries.[1] Making changes to your diet, lifestyle and exercise routine can help you safely lower your overall body fat and reduce your risk for certain health conditions.",
            "steps": [
                "Opt for meals that are low-calorie. Low-calorie diets will help you lose weight and reduce body fat.[2] Monitor how many calories you eat daily and reduce this number by around 500 calories each day. This will yield a 1 – 2 pound weight loss per week.[3]\n\n\nCount how many calories you're currently consuming. You can use a food journal, app or online calculator to help you do this accurately. Cut out about 500 calories from this number. Your end result should be what you aim for daily for slow and safe body fat loss.\nDo not try to follow a very low calorie diet or consume less than 1,200 calories daily. When you're calories are too low, you may stop losing weight or lose lean muscle mass, not body fat.[4]\n\nYou may want to check with your physician or dietitian about the amount of calories you should be consuming in order to reduce body fat.",
                "Focus on lean protein. Protein is essential for your body's metabolism. Focusing on lean protein at all meals and snacks can help support weight loss and body fat reduction.[5]\n\nLean protein should be included at all meals. This will help ensure you meet your daily recommended amount. Women should aim for 46 g daily and men should aim for 56 g.[6]\n\nLean protein sources include: poultry, lean beef, pork, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy and seafood.\nLimit or avoid sources of protein that contain higher amounts of saturated fat. Some studies have shown that a diet rich in saturated fats may increase body fat — especially in your abdomen.[7] Limit foods like: full-fat dairy, fatty cuts of meat, and butter.",
                "Make fruits and vegetables a priority in meals. In addition to lean protein, make a large part of your meals and snacks vegetables. You will also want to eat plenty of fruit. These foods are very nutritious and contain a lot of healthy nutrients your body needs.\n\n\nIt's generally recommended to consume about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Aim for one to two servings of fruit and the rest should be vegetables.[8]\n\nAlso, when you're choosing foods from these groups, try to choose items that are brightly colored or darkly colored. These foods are typically more nutrient-dense meaning they contain higher amounts of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.[9] For example, choose kale over iceberg lettuce.\nTry using vegetables creatively. Try them raw with a dip or in a salad, sauté them on the stove, cook them in a soup, roast them in the oven, grill them outside, or hide them in a smoothie or in spaghetti sauce and serve over spaghetti squash.",
                "Reduce the amount of grains you eat. One of the best ways to reduce your body fat is to reduce the amount of grains you eat each day.[10] These carbohydrate-rich foods can slow the reduction of body fat.\n\n\nFoods that are high in carbohydrates include: bread, rice, pastries, sweets, pasta, crackers, chips, English muffins, and bagels. These highly processed grains contain little nutrition and can quickly raise blood sugar which often results in fat storage. [11]\n\nThere are other foods that contain carbohydrates like fruits and legumes; however, these foods also contain a high amount of other essential nutrients and shouldn't necessarily be limited.",
                "Make water your number one drink of choice. On a normal day, most people should drink about eight 8-oz glasses of water. Choose no-calorie, decaf beverages for the most hydrating fluids.[12]\n\nAvoid sweetened, calorie filled beverages like sodas, juice or energy drinks as they will add calories to your diet and may increase body fat.\nThis is a general recommendation. The amounts of fluids needed will differ for everyone depending on their size and amount of perspiration. For example, those participating in aerobic exercise will need to drink more to help them re-hydrate. Let thirst be your first guide.",
                "Eat fermented foods. Fermented foods, such as organic kefir, organic yogurt, and sauerkraut contain live cultures of good bacteria. Having large amounts of good bacteria in our intestines can help maintain a healthy weight.[13] You can also take probiotics, which may even help manage stress.[14]",
                "Avoid added sugars and artificial sweeteners. They can increase cravings and lead to overeating. There are over 60 names for added sugars, so it can sometimes be a challenge to identify them in an ingredient list. Some examples of added sugars are:[15]\n\nAgave nectar\nBarley malt\nCane juice\nCorn syrup\nDextrose\nEvaporated cane juice\nHigh-fructose corn syrup\nMalton \nMaple syrup\nMolasses\nHoney\nSucrose\nRice syrup",
                "Increase your aerobic activity level. Put together an aerobic exercise routine that will work in conjunction with your diet to cut body fat. Together, aerobic exercise and diet have been shown to be one of the best combinations to reduce body fat.\n\n\nIn general, it's recommended to include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week — that's just 20 minutes every day.[16] To speed the reduction of body fat, it's suggested to work out for longer — up to 60 minutes daily.[17]\n\nInclude a wide variety of aerobic exercises like: walking/jogging, running, biking, dancing, swimming, martial arts or boxing and using the elliptical. Choose activities you enjoy, as this will make you more likely to stick with it.\nIf you're just starting out with exercise, start by building upon your current activity regimen.\nWhether you opt for low impact exercises such as swimming or walking, or a more intense routine like kickboxing or weight training, aim to work out for at least 30 minutes.",
                "Add in high-intensity interval exercises. Some studies have shown that more vigorous intensity exercises that are done in intervals decrease body fat more efficiently than moderate-intensity exercise.[18]\n\nInterval training combines both very high- and moderate-intensity exercise. These workouts are usually done for shorter periods of time. An example of interval training is: 1 minute of sprinting followed by 3 minutes of jogging. This cycle would be repeated several times, for about 20 minutes total (not including your warm up and cool down).\nInterval training is great for body fat reduction as it has been shown to burn more calories from fat and keeps your metabolism elevated up to 24 hours after you've completed the workout.[19]",
                "Include regular resistance training. Strength training does not burn high levels of fat when you're performing the exercises; however, over time, strength training can help you build lean muscle mass which can help you increase your metabolism and your body's ability to burn calories.[20]\n\nIt's recommended to include strength training two to three days a week for at least 30 minutes.[21] It's important to work all large muscle groups throughout the week.\nAlways include at least two days of rest and recovery between strength training routines. Your body and muscles need time for adequate recovery, otherwise performance may suffer over time.[22]",
                "Increase your lifestyle activity. In addition to cardio and strength training, you can increase your daily lifestyle activity. Studies have shown that, in general, people who are more active tend to be healthier.[23]\n\nThink about how much you move or how many steps you take in a day. How can you increase that?\nA few ways to increase movement in your day include: do leg lifts while you sit at your desk or stand or do knee raises during commercial breaks.\nAdd more steps to your day by: taking a walk break during lunch, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away from your destination, and walk to places that are close to you (like the grocery store or pharmacy).",
                "Manage stress levels. Studies have shown that long-term, low-grade, chronic stress increases cortisol levels in the body. When this occurs, not only can it be difficult to lose weight, you may even gain more body fat.[24]\n\nExercising regularly can help manage stress levels. If you're feeling overwhelmed or overly stressed, take a 10 minute walk to help yourself calm down and unwind. Try yoga, which can be meditative.\nEngage in other activities that will also help you relax. You can listen to music, read a good book or magazine, journaling, get together with friends, or watch a movie. Try meditation, deep breathing, positive visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation.\nIf you're having trouble managing stress levels, consider talking to a therapist or behavior specialist. These health professionals will be able to coach and guide you to better stress management.\nAvoid relying on tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, or other drugs.",
                "Go to bed earlier. Many people do not get adequate rest each night. Sleep is important for a variety of bodily functions including weight management. Go bed to earlier to get more sleep to help reduce your body fat levels.[25]\n\nIt's recommended to get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. You may need to go to bed earlier and wake up a little later (if possible) to help you increase the amount you sleep each night.\nAdequate rest also helps improve athletic performance in addition to helping you manage your hunger signals throughout the day.",
                "Ensure that you are eating healthy portions. Portion control is necessary if you want to reduce body fat. Portion controlling will help you reduce your overall calorie intake and body fat.\n\n\nIn general, average healthy adults adults should consume no more than 3 – 4 oz of protein, 1/2 cup of grains, 1/2 cup of fruit and 1 cup of vegetables per serving.[26]\n\nUse measuring cups or a food scale to help keep you on track with your portions.\nYou can also use smaller plates, bowls and cups to physically limit how much food you can serve yourself at one sitting.\nConsuming more than the recommended portions of foods may increase your risk for gaining weight and increasing total body fat.",
                "Eat mindfully. Turn off your TV, put away your phone or book, and pay attention when you are eating. Eat slowly, chew well, and savor your food. Eating while distracted or when you are feeling emotional can cause you to overeat.[27] Try to be present when you eat your food, noticing the tastes, smells, and textures.",
                "Start a journal or log. Whenever you're trying to lose weight or reduce your body fat, it's a good idea to start a journal. You can include a variety of information, but this log will help you see and measure your success.\n\n\nStart a journal prior to making any changes. You might make notes about what you plan to change, your timeline and any other ideas or thoughts you have.\nThink about keeping track of your foods and beverages. Logging what you eat has been shown to help people stay on track. It will also allow you to see any slip ups or help you determine if what you're eating is affecting your success.[28]\n\nAlso keep track of any measurements you take like your weight.",
                "Get on the scale weekly. When you're trying to lose weight and reduce your overall body fat, it's important to monitor your progress. One way to check in is by weighing yourself weekly.\n\n\nStudies have shown that weekly weigh-ins help people stay on track and on target. You're more likely to be successful long-term if you continue to self monitor and check-in with your weight.[29]\n\nIdeally, weigh yourself about one to two times a week. It might be harder to see accurate progress if you're weighing yourself daily due to normal fluctuations in body weight.\nFor the most accurate measure of your progress, weigh yourself on the same day of the week, at the same time and in the same clothes. First thing in the morning, before eating or drinking, before dressing, but after using the restroom is best.",
                "Take your measurements. As you continue to lose weight and reduce your overall body fat, you'll notice that it's not only the scale that's changing. If you're losing body fat, you should also notice the size and shape of your body also changes.\n\n\nPrior to starting your diet and exercise program, take a variety of measurements. These will help you see where you're losing the most fat.\nTypical places to measure and track are: waist, hips, bust, thighs and upper arms. Keep these measurements in a journal. Every month, re-measure yourself to help you track your progress.\nIf your weight is staying the same, but your measurements are smaller and you have been working out, you are likely gaining muscle and losing fat, which is a healthy improvement.",
                "Get a body fat percentage test. If you're able, get your body fat percentage tested and evaluated. This is the percentage of your body that is made up from fat. As you continue to diet and exercise, this percentage should decrease over time.[30]\n\nMany gyms offer body fat percentage as a free service to their members. Ask a staff member or trainer at your local gym for more information.\nYou may also ask your doctor or physician if they have the equipment in office to evaluate your body fat percentage.\nThere are devices you can purchase for home use, but these typically take a lot of experience and practice using. Your margin of error will most likely be much larger compared to a health or fitness professional doing the tests for you."

        "How to Get a Dancer's Body": {
            "intro": "It’s possible to achieve a long, lean, strong dancer’s body without having been a dancer all your life, but it will take hard work and will power. Prepare to exercise every day and follow a healthy diet. Exercise will build the muscles and help you tone, but diet is what will get you lean.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Listen to your body. Ballerinas and other dancers are commonly asked about what they eat. Their specific diets vary, but all of them eat with one primary goal in mind: keeping their bodies healthy and full of energy.\n\n\nWhen deciding what’s right for you in a given day, pay attention to how you feel. As your diet becomes healthier, you’ll grow more aware of the foods that make you feel best. Stick to those!\nAs an example, if you wake up feeling very hungry, eat a larger but healthy breakfast. If you don’t feel like having much, have a smoothie or a hot, unsweetened drink and a piece of fruit.",
                "Drink plenty of water. How much water you need in a day depends on your size, weight, activity level and where you live. To calculate how much water you need, take your weight in pounds and divide it in half: that number is where you should start.[2]\n\nOn average, a 150-pound person needs between 75 and 150 ounces of water each day. If they were sedentary and living in a cool climate, they would drink closer to 75 ounces of water each day; if they were active and lived in a hot climate, their intake would be closer to 150 ounces.[3]",
                "Take supplements (optional). Many ballerinas start their morning with a glass of water and supplements. If your diet is complete and you have no health concerns, you may not need supplements at all. It really depends on personal taste and needs.\n\n\nIf you are chronically tired or have any other chronic health concerns, consult a doctor about taking supplements.\nAs an example, if you’re often tired, you may find that your iron and/or vitamin D levels are low, in which case you might need to take supplements.",
                "Eat lean sources of protein. Healthy sources of protein include seafood; white-meat poultry (e.g., chicken breast or turkey breast); milk, cheese, and yogurt; eggs; beans; pork tenderloin; soy; lean beef; and meal replacement drinks.[4]\n\nSome ballerinas start their morning with a smoothie, hot milky drink (e.g., a cappuccino), greek yogurt, or eggs.[5][6]",
                "Eat healthy sources of fat. It might seem counterintuitive, but eating fat is actually good for you — you just need to make sure you’re eating good fats, not bad ones.[7] To find out what types of fats are in your foods, read the labels and/or look them up online.[8]\n\nBad fats include saturated fats and artificial trans fatty acids. Saturated fats are found in animal products and in vegetable fats that liquefy at room temperature (e.g. coconut and palm oils). Artificial trans fatty acids are found in packaged foods and some margarines.[9]\n\nGood fats include unsaturated fats such as those found in vegetable oils, fish, plants, flaxseeds, and walnuts.[10]",
                "Limit your carb intake. Most professional dancers are careful about their starch and sugar intake. Those that do eat carbs mainly eat healthy ones such as whole wheat bread or rye crackers, or vegetables.[11][12]\n\nSome professional dancers claim to eat mostly protein and to avoid carbs.[13]\n\nNote that the lower your carb intake, the more likely you are to need a supplement, particularly fibre and folic acid.[14]\n\nWhile cutting carbs will likely help you lose weight, it may also cause tiredness and digestive problems. If you’re planning to go very low-carb, consult a nutritionist to ensure that you do it healthfully.",
                "Avoid all processed foods. When dancers list what they eat it’s almost always whole foods, and when they do eat things that come out of a package, it’s usually a healthy snack bar made of nuts and/or dried fruit.[15][16]\n\nMost diet plans recommend avoiding processed foods as much as possible, as these are more likely to contain sodium and carbohydrates, both of which will do nothing to help you lose weight.",
                "Treat yourself. Even dancers know that if you deprive yourself of a “guilty pleasure” long enough, you may end up bingeing. If you have a sweet tooth, allow yourself a bit of a high-quality, dark chocolate bar now and then![17]\n\nYou don’t want to indulge every day, but you can definitely give into those cravings now and then — the key is to eat something relatively healthy, and only a small amount of it.",
                "Warm up before and after exercise. Do some light pilates or yoga, stretching, or some slow cardio for at least five to ten minutes before and after you exercise. This will ensure that your muscles are loose and warm, and will help prevent injury.[18]\n\nMany dancers start and end their day with at least some gentle stretching in order to keep their limbs feeling limber.[19]\n\nTailor your warmup to your exercise. If you’re going to do cardio, start with a slow activity like walking or biking at an easy pace. If you’re doing strength training, do a slow jog or walk, then some light activity that uses the muscles you intend to work on.[20]",
                "Do Pilates. Pilates is a system of exercises known for creating long, lean muscles in the arms, legs, and backside. Pilates will also help strengthen your core, giving you better balance, good abs, and a toned back.[21]",
                "Do 30 to 60 minutes of cardio each day.[22] Cardio will help you lose weight or, if you’re already at a healthy body weight, it will help you maintain your current weight.\n\n\nYou don’t have to get the entire 30 to 60 minutes in in one big chunk. You can also do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the afternoon, and 20 minutes after work/school, or at other intervals that suit you throughout the day — doing it this way will keep your metabolism revved.[23]",
                "Strength train. To get a dancer’s body you must build muscle, and strength training will help you do that. To keep your muscles lean, try using light weights with high repetitions:\n\n\nUsually you’d use a weight that would exhaust you by the time you reached your 5th to 15th repetition (depending on the exercise and the trainer). This time, try weights that allow you to reach 18 to 20 repetitions before you have to give up.[24]",
                "Dance. A no-brainer way to get a dancer’s body is to dance. Like with running, cardio, and weight-training, dancing provides a full body workout.[25]",
                "Swim. If you’re weight-training and running regularly, consider giving your joints a break by swimming. Swimming gives you cardio and helps elongate your muscles without causing stress to your joints.[26]",
                "Go slowly. Jumping into a new exercise routine too quickly and ambitiously is a great way to burn yourself out and/or injure yourself. Add exercises to your routine in slow, small increments, giving yourself time to build strength and stamina.\n\n\nIf you currently don't do any cardio at all, don’t try to jump into 30 minutes a day. Start with 30 minutes of brisk walking, three times a week.",
                "Pay attention to your body. You might feel tired or a bit sore after exercising, but you shouldn’t be in pain. If anything causes you pain, stop doing it. If the pain persists, depending on how severe and long-lasting it is, you may want to consult a doctor.",
                "Take rest days. Allowing yourself to rest is imperative to building muscles. If you do work out every day, be sure to alternate you workouts so that you’re not using the same muscles every day.",
                "Build your calf muscles using a ledge. Stand on a ledge (a stair will work well) with your toes/balls of your feet on the ledge and your heels hanging off. Draw your heels up so that you’re standing on your toes, then slowly lower them back down. Do this for roughly 5 minutes.\n\n\nIf your calves begin to burn, that's a good sign! Just make sure it’s a good burn, and not a painful tearing feeling. If at any point it feels truly painful, stop!",
                "Do leg lifts. Start by lying on your back with your legs straight out and your hands at your sides. Keeping your legs straight, raise them to a 45-degree angle from the ground. Slowly lower your legs to just above the ground (don’t touch it!) and repeat. This is a simple leg lift, but there are many variations:\n\n\nLie on your back with your hands behind your head and elbows wide. Raise your legs to a 45-degree angle and hold them there while you move them in crisscross motions for 30 seconds — right leg in front of left, then vice versa. As you do this, your shoulder blades should be off the floor as well, as if you were doing a crunch. Your legs should remain straight the entire time.[27]\n\nLie on your back with your legs up at 45 degrees and your hands at your sides. Use your abs to raise your shoulder blades and arms off the floor. Again you should look like you’re doing crunches, but with your arms straight out in front of you and your legs at 45 degrees.[28]\n\nLie on your back and lift your shoulders a few inches off the ground as you move your legs into an L position. Place your hands behind your head and lift the leg that’s still on the ground slightly off the ground. Keeping your lower leg and shoulders off the ground, curl up towards the highest leg (the vertical part of the L shape) and pulse for 30 seconds. Then, switch legs and repeat. You can speed this up to single pulses as well.[29]\n\nThese exercises tone your abs, thighs, and bum. If you find these exercises challenging, you can raise your legs slightly higher than 45 degrees to make the exercise less difficult.[30]\n\nThere are also variations that include standing up and kicking your legs out behind you — these are great for firming up your buns.[31]",
                "Do a plié. Place one hand on the counter or back of a chair, and lift your opposite arm towards the ceiling, allowing a gentle bend in your elbow. Ensure that your back is straight (shoulders down, pelvis tucked, abs in and tensed) and that your heels are touching, with your toes pointed outward (your feet should look like a V).[32]\n\nMaintaining a good posture, lift your heels 2 inches off the floor so that your weight is now on the balls of your feet. This is your starting position.\nContinuing to maintain your posture, bend your knees and lower your body up to 12 inches. Hold in this lowered position for one count (say one one thousand inside your head) before returning to your starting position.\nDo two sets of 10 repetitions. Stay on the balls of your feet throughout.[33]",
                "Do a wide plié.[34] Holding onto the edge of a chair or counter with one hand, raise your opposite arm towards the ceiling with a gentle bend at the elbow. Stand with your feet roughly 3 feet apart, toes pointed out.\n\n\nDraw your shoulders down and away from you ears, tighten your abs, tuck your pelvis, and bend your knees. This is your starting position.\nEnsuring that you maintain your starting posture (shoulders down, abs strong, pelvis tucked, knees bent), raise your heels off the floor as high as you can. Stay on the balls of your feet.\nRemaining on the balls of your feet, with bent knees and a tucked pelvis, squeeze your butt muscles, and press your thighs and knees back. This should be a small movement. Hold the tension for one count (say one one thousand inside your head), then release.\nDo two sets of 20 reps. This exercise will firm your thighs and bum.",
                "Do a reverse pushup.[35] Sit with your legs extended in front of you and your arms at your sides. Your palms should be on the floor with your thumbs pointing forward and your fingers pointing out to the side. Tuck your pelvis and lift your bum as high as possible off the floor.\n\n\nBend your elbows and lower your body roughly 2 inches, holding it there as you count to two. Being careful not to lock your elbows, push back up to your starting position (pelvis tucked, bum lifted). Do 15 reps.\nBe sure to keep your pelvis tucked and your abs strong (pulled in) throughout this exercise. If you find it too difficult, a variation is to place your feet flat on the floor and bend your knees.[36]",
                "See the benefits of your new program. One way to stay motivated is to identify the ways in which your exercise and diet routine benefit you. For example, you might feel stronger or have more energy, or reduce your risk for diabetes.[37]\n\nIt may be enough to focus on the aesthetics at first — that you’ll be thinner — but this may not be enough to keep you motivated in the long run.\nAllow your motivations to change. If you’re feeling unmotivated, sit down and remind yourself why you’re working so hard for your new body. You may find it helpful to write it down in a journal.",
                "Record your progress. Keep track of your weight, measurements, daily food intake, and daily exercise. When you need motivation, look at your progress. If you’re exercising daily and eating healthy, you will see a difference, and measuring this difference may keep you going.\n\n\nOften weight won’t tell you much about how you’re doing in your exercise program. You might even find that you get heavier as you build muscle. Measuring yourself, or even just paying attention to how you feel and how your clothes fit, is generally more effective than weighing yourself.\nYou can download apps on your smart phone or tablet that can help you record your progress and even share it with other people.",
                "Be realistic. Experts repeatedly warn us that if we try to do too much too soon, we’ll burn out.[38] Instead of jumping into an hour of exercise every day, make small, incremental boosts to your current routine.\n\n\nAs an example, if you already jog once a week and do yoga twice a week, you could add one Pilates class (or video) and two 30-minute walks to your weekly routine.",
                "Set weekly goals. Keep track of what you do every day, and at the end of each week, tally up your work. If you’ve met your goal for that week, reward yourself.[39]\n\nAn example of your first week’s goal might be 30 minutes of cardio for three days, plus two days of yoga, and one day of Pilates; in addition, you only ate carbs once per day, where you’d normally eat them at every meal.",
                "Don’t think of it as exercise. Try to do things that hide the fact that you’re exercising — for example, walking or playing with your dog, or playing recreational sports such as soccer or tennis.[40]\n\nYou could even join a dance class, which would be particularly useful given that you’re trying to get a dancer’s body!",
                "Make a schedule. Take the time to go over your schedule and specifically block out the times in which you’ll exercise and prepare healthy meals for yourself.[41]\n\nWhen creating a schedule try to account for things that might go wrong — for example, a meeting running late or waking up feeling sick.\nIf you don’t carve out a specific block of time for your exercise and/or healthy meal preparation, chances are you won’t find the time to do those things.",
                "Be positive. You will have setbacks. It’s important not to beat yourself up over these things. Get through the setback and then get back on track with your diet and exercise.[42]\n\nFor example, if you sleep in and miss going for a run on Monday, don’t give up on your whole week. Just get back on schedule and make sure you don’t miss your next scheduled exercise session.",
                "Find a friend to work out with you. Having a workout buddy can keep you accountable and more likely to stick to your routine. They can also help make working out more fun. Just make sure they’re as motivated as you are!\n\n\nMake sure that you don’t use their lack of motivation as an excuse for your own if your friend cancels on your workout sessions.",
                "Keep learning. Always keep an eye out for new recipes and exercises so that you don’t get bored with your current ones. Keeping yourself educated about healthy living techniques will help keep you inspired."

                "Teach the individual deep breathing exercises. Deep breathing inhibits adrenaline and oxygenates the brain. Use the following steps while the person is calm, so that when out of control and having a \"meltdown\" (as it is commonly called), the individual will be able use these techniques to calm himself. Teaching these techniques while the person is upset is much more difficult, though not impossible.\n\n\nMirror the person while you do each step.\nBreathe in through the nose slowly and evenly until the lungs are at full capacity.\nWhen the lungs are completely full, the stomach pushes out, so calling each breath a “belly breath” provides a concrete image that helps in visualizing the proper technique.\nHold the breath for a slow count of five.\nBreathe out through the mouth, releasing the air slowly and evenly.\nRepeat five times: Five \"belly breaths\" held for a count of five make one group (or set).",
                "Practice up to three sets of \"belly breaths\" two times each day. Do it once in the morning and once in the evening. Practice until the person can do the breathing independently.",
                "Use imagery (below) during breathing. It will add to the calming influence of the breathing itself.",

                "Find out the colors, sounds and feelings the person finds peaceful.\n\n\nMany times it is water, either waves or a gurgling brook.\nFocus on determining the particular color of light that is calming. It is normally some uniform, pastel color.",
                "Write a script. It should consist of short lines which describe the process of walking towards the calming sound (perhaps a brook or ocean) and going towards the calming light.\n\n\nDescribe how, as the person gets closer, the place becomes safer and safer, how the warm light of a certain color is welcoming, protecting, calming.",
                "Ask the person to shut his or her eyes. This will enhance their ability to imagine the situation you're describing. However, don't force them into situations they're uncomfortable with.",
                "Use a recorder to play his or her specific comforting sounds. This might be helpful during the breathing and a few minutes afterwards.",

                "Reverse the process. Continue the script: Walk away from the calming force (water, for example), but remind the person that the light is now carried within, calm begetting calm. Return to the beginning of the script, carefully reversing the dialogue.",
                "Ask the person to open their eyes. Ask them if they feel calmer, or if they want to continue with imagery and breathing techniques.",
                "Implement imagery beyond practice sessions. Use this technique, once learned, along with deep breathing, to bring calm in \"meltdown\" situations.",
                "Ensure that the person wants to be hugged. Talk the person through this process prior to attempting any hugs. If trust is an issue, or if the child is young, demonstrate the process with another person. This will ease the child into understanding and offer comfort.",

                "Hug them, if they want. You can do \"practice hugs\" during calm times, and calming hugs during distressing times. Use this process:\n\n\nApproach person from the back.\nHold your upper arms out straight and your forearms pointing at the sky (up).\nTalk as you go through the entire experience so there are no surprises and everything is comfortable.\nAsk the person to put their arms at their sides.\nUsing your forearms, provide a moderate amount of pressure on the person's upper arms near the torso. Squeeze moderately for the count of ten, then release.\nRepeat this five times.",
                "Ask the person if they want more hugs. If yes, repeat again in sequences of five.\n\n\nStop after the third set, if the person has asked for that many.",
                "Ask the person how he/she feels. If they feel calmer or liked the hug, they may want more. If not, they may want to try something else.",
                "Repeat hugging if desired. Use this and any of the other calming techniques as necessary during meltdowns to help the person calm down. But continue practicing and doing it during calm times, too - you don't want hugging to become associated only with meltdowns or distress."

        "wikiHow to Stop Ants from Coming Into Your Home": {
            "intro": "On Earth, ants outnumber humans 140,000:1. However, that doesn't mean they need to become guests in your house. You can keep them out by destroying their nest, removing their food sources, building barriers, and baiting their scouts. Read on to learn how to stop ants from coming into your home uninvited.",
            "steps": [
                "Seal off all entrance areas. Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of them of are easy to identify; others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants marching through them. First, figure out where the ants are entering the house: follow the trail of ants to see where they're entering and leaving your home. Seal all the entrance holes that you can find using silicone caulk, putty, glue or plaster. Temporary methods might include petroleum jelly or poster tack.\n\n\nIf you use a temporary sealant, like poster tack, only do so until you can fill the space with a more permanent solution. A weaker material will deteriorate over time, and the gap will open up again.",
                "Seal cracks with caulk. Close the gaps around windows, doors, and walls. Block off any space that might permit passage to an ant army. Your sealing efforts will be most effective if you're thorough.\n\n\nAn additional benefit of sealing off your home: more effective temperature control, and thus lower energy bills. Plus, this is one of the least risky methods where kids or pets are concerned.",
                "Line suspected entryways with anti-ant substances. This is a somewhat more aggressive tactic than simply caulking up the cracks. You can create barriers of chemicals and powders that repel—even kill—unwitting ants. Consider diatomaceous earth, salt, and even commercial ant poisons. This might function as a form of baiting.\n\n\nDiatomaceous earth is a fine powder that kills ants by pulling all the moisture from their bodies. It works by absorbing moisture from the ant itself, but it's best used in dry environments. You also don't want anyone in the house (especially pets and children) sniffing it up.\nTry using salt. It has a similar drying-out effect on ants, especially if they carry it back to their nests. You can spread it under doors, near windows, and along the edges of your walls.[1]",
                "Make a tape barrier. Line your kitchen with adhesive tape, sticky-side up. No poison or messy powders necessary. When ants try to climb over the tape, they may stick to the adhesive – effectively stopping them in their tracks. Make sure that the ants can't crawl under the tape; try using double-sided tape, or taping the back of the tape to your floors, walls, and counters so that there is no room for ants underneath.[2]",
                "Try making a barrier from talcum powder. Talc in various forms is thought to deter ants, although the mechanism is poorly understood. Tailor's chalk and baby powder usually contain talc, so you can use them to create a barrier for ants. Regardless of which form of talc you use: keep in mind that talc has been called out as a potential carcinogen.\n\n\nMany sources recommend using normal chalk; however, this is made of gypsum, not talc. This misconception could be the result of confusion with \"ant chalk\", which is an insecticide that looks just like normal chalk. It was outlawed in the US in the 1990s, but you may still be able to find it in certain underground markets.\nSome baby powder brands are made of corn starch, so they will not work effectively against ants. Check the ingredients before you build your barrier.",
                "Try using nontoxic ant deterrents. You can also defend your home with scents and substances that ants don't like. Consider some combination of vinegar, peppermint oil, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves.[3]\n\nBe careful where you place your deterrents: keep peppers and spicy things away from curious pets and children.",
                "Squish the scouts. Colonies regularly send out lone ants to check for food sources. If you see an individual ant strolling across your coffee table, don't let it make it back to the nest alive. It'll tell the colony where you spilled the apple juice. If the scout makes it back to the nest and brings back some friends, they'll be following a scent trail, single file. Unless you're ready to bait them and wait them out – squish them all, and do it quickly.\n\n\nSpray the trail with all-purpose cleaner or a bleach solution, then wipe it up with a wet paper towel. Spraying the nest can be effective, but you want to make sure that you get them all. If you only kill part of the colony, you may simply encourage some species of ant to establish new colonies – which ultimately won't stop ants from coming into your home.\nFor a less hands-on solution, vacuum them all up. Then, vacuum some talcum powder or diatomaceous earth to finish off the ants inside the vacuum cleaner. This second step is important: make sure that the ants don't survive their trip into the vacuum!\nIn a pinch, just use your hands or a damp towel. Squish the ants or wipe them into oblivion. You don't need any fancy methods to eliminate the scouts.",
                "Use water. If the ants are all over the floor, throw some water over them and wipe them up with a paper towel. If ants are on your bed, get a good handful of paper towels and a cup of water. Dip the towels into the water. Squeeze to let out all the extra water—you don't want to be sleeping on a soppy bed—and then wipe them all up.\n\n\nRepeat this process as needed. You might need to do it many times to rid your home of all the ants.",
                "Bring down the nest. If ants continue to raid your home, you're going to have to raid theirs. If you're able to locate the nest, you can pour several gallons of boiling water into it to instantly kill most of the insects within. If you don't know where they're coming from, your best alternative is to bait them.[4]",
                "Kill the queen. The most permanent way to get rid of ants is to destroy their source: the ant queen. The queen produces a large number of ants, and she gives direction to the nest. Destroy the queen, and you'll scatter the ants. You can find the queen at the center of the ant nest. Follow the trail of ants back to the nest, if possible.\n\n\nConsider hiring an exterminator. If the trail of ant-workers disappears into the wall of your kitchen, you'll find it much more difficult to trace. An exterminator can do this for you.[5]",
                "Don't leave food out. These ants are coming into your home because there is something there for them: a food source or a warm environment. If you have a very dirty house, ants will multiply – so make sure that you clean daily. The cleaner you keep the house, the less they'll have to eat, and the more they'll look elsewhere for sustenance.[6]\n\nWipe down all surfaces. Spray tables and counter-tops with a mild bleach or vinegar solution. Make sure you keep up with a regular cleaning regimen: sweep, mop, and vacuum at least a few days each week.\nIf you do accidentally leave something out, take the opportunity to trace the trail of ants back to their source. It can be tempting to wipe out a swarm immediately – but try to think long-term about the problem.",
                "Remember that all it takes is one ant. If you see a lone ant roaming your counters, it is acting as a scout. It is scoping out your kitchen for scents and food sources. If this ant discovers a perceived food source—even just a sticky sweet spot on the counter-top—it will carry the information back to its nest, and you'll have an infestation on your hands.",
                "Store food in airtight containers. Even if you've stashed your food in a cupboard, ants can still find their way in through the smallest of holes. If they can smell it and reach it, then they will swarm it. Putting food in airtight containers has the added bonus of keeping the food fresher.\n\n\nConsider buying Tupperware or another brand of standardized, sealed containers. It may be easier to keep track of your containers (lids and bottoms) if you're using a uniform set.\nConsider washing out resealable containers, then reusing them to store food. This might be a resealable yogurt tub, or a plastic takeout box, or even a lightly-used Ziploc bag.",
                "Keep the sink clean. This means no dirty dishes, no standing water for ants to drink, and no food in the drain. If you clean your hands, food, and dishes in this sink, you want to make sure that it's a safe and sanitary environment.\n\n\nPlace pet-food bowls in a slightly larger bowl, then add some water to the larger bowl. This creates a moat around the pet food that the ants can't easily cross.",
                "Pick your poison. Mixing boric acid powder or borax with maple syrup is the most common bait; some popular commercial ant poisons essential monetize this mix. Boric acid affects ants both externally (when in powder form; similar to diatomaceous earth) and internally (when ingested). The ants bring the poison (borax or boric acid) with them to the colony and spread it around. If you get the quantity and timing just right, you can wipe out a large colony, but it might take anywhere from several weeks to a few months.[7]",
                "Mix the bait carefully. A bait that's too strong will kill the ants before they make it home, and a bait that's too weak will only weaken the colony temporarily. Be intentional about your increments. The idea is for the poison to spread all throughout the colony before it begins to kill the unwitting ants.[8] The boric acid kills the ants; the water dilutes the boric acid; and the sugar attracts the ants. Try the following recipes:\n\n\nMix 1 cup water, 2 cups sugar, and 2 tablespoons boric acid.\nMix 3 cups of water, 1 cup of sugar, and 4 teaspoons of boric acid.",
                "Administer the bait. Try letting the mixture sit in an upturned lid or a low dish for easy access. If you have pets or small children, leave the bait in a container that will allow ants to enter, but isn't wide enough for larger creatures to get at the poison. Carefully shake the poison into the bottom of a metal can. Crush one side of the can, but leave a gap that is just thin enough for ants to get inside. [9]",
                "Wait for the ants to show up. Remove any deterrents, if you used them; the idea of baiting is to attract the ants so that they'll defeat themselves. Don't lure new ants with the bait, or else you might attract new colonies.",
                "Move the bait closer and closer to the nest. Once there's a line of busy and scavengers, place the bait next to the trail. The mass of ants will shift to swirl around the bait. Keep moving it further from your kitchen and closer to where the ants are entering your home.\n\n\nBe careful not to place the bait directly on top of the ant trail. You'll confuse them and interrupt their march home, making your baiting strategy less effective."
