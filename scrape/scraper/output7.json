        "How to Take Care of a Chinese Water Dragon": {
            "intro": "Chinese water dragons can make great pets. However, you should be prepared to properly care for them. Like all reptiles, they require careful attention, need specialized diets, controlled temperatures in their enclosure, and gentle handling. If you feel like you would be a good match for a Chinese water dragon, learn some more details on what it takes to care for them.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn how to handle your water dragon. Part of the fun of having a pet is handling it and enjoying its company. Handling your water dragon can be fun for both you and your pet, if done properly. As always, be gentle whenever handling your dragon, in addition to these other steps:[1]\n\nHandle your dragon at a young age to ensure that it's accepting of being handled as an adult.\nWork slowly when trying to handle your water dragon at first. It will need to get used to your presence before trusting you.\nDon't force any interaction with your water dragon. Doing so will only cause your water dragon to distrust you.\nTry hand feeding your dragon first, inside the cage. Once it accepts food from your hand, you can try to remove it from its container.\nNever pick up a water dragon by its tail.",
                "Provide a proper diet. Your water dragon will need a diet that suits its nutritional needs and matches what it would eat in the wild. The diet will consist mainly of insects, of various types, and some vegetables and fruit. This diet will help keep it healthy, strong, and happy.[2]\n\nThe main elements of the diet include crickets and mealworms. However, these tend to be low in calcium in captivity and need to be dusted with calcium powder immediately prior to feeding to the water dragon, to ensure that the dragon gets enough calcium in the diet for healthy bones.\nWaxworms are also an option, however, they are high in fat and should be offered sparsely.\nDark green vegetables, such as kale, collard, mustard, and dandelion leaves can be a great addition to your dragon's diet.\nSome fruits can be included as well. Try feeding your water dragon bananas, cantaloupe, or strawberries.\nLarge adult water dragons can eat earthworms, pinkie mice, or small feeder fish.\nYoung dragons should be fed daily.\nAdult water dragons should be fed once every three days.",
                "Groom your water dragon. Your water dragon won't require much grooming, however, there are some things you can do to keep your water dragon clean and happy. The two main areas of grooming that you will focus on involve the nails and bathing of your dragon.[3]\n\nKeep an eye on your water dragons nails. If you notice the nails getting long, they can be trimmed. Keeping them short will make handling the dragon more comfortable.\nFind someone who can show you how to trim your dragons nails in person, as it is difficult for a beginner to do without seriously harming the water dragon.[4]\n\nAllow your water dragon to soak in water regularly. This can help prevent constipation as well as keep it clean.",
                "Schedule regular exams with a veterinarian. As with all pets, scheduling a regular exam with your veterinarian is a critical part of maintaining that pet's health. Find a local veterinarian that works with reptiles and ask them about setting up appointments to examine your Chinese water dragon.[5]\n\nYoung dragons, under the age of four, should be checked at least once annually.\nOlder water dragons, over four years, should be examined twice yearly.",
                "Maintain water and humidity levels. Water dragons need adequate levels of both standing water and humidity in its environment. Both water and humidity levels must be maintained properly to ensure the longevity and health of your water dragon.[6][7]\n\nHumidity should be kept at around 80% in the water dragon's container. You can find a device to measure humidity levels at any pet store.[8]\n\nDrip machines are available to maintain humidity. Spray bottles and waterfalls will work as well.\nWater should be made available in large containers. These containers should allow your water dragon easy access. Make sure that your dragon can get out of the water containers when it wants, without trouble.",
                "Purchase proper lighting. Providing the right amount and type of lighting is important to help keep your water dragon in a good state of health and well-being. Like other reptiles, water dragons are cold blooded, and need external heat to regulate its body temperature. Water dragons are also diurnal, and need light to know if it is night or daytime.[9]\n\nFor the main, daytime lighting, use incandescent lighting. These will provide white light as well as heat.\nLights in the enclosure should be turned off at night. Make sure however, that the temperature is maintained at around 75-79°F.\nWater dragons need exposure to ultraviolet light. During the day, the sun will provide this, however, UV light cannot penetrate glass. Place your water dragons in a secure mesh container to allow the UV light to reach it.\nNever place a glass container in direct sunlight as this may cause deadly temperatures.\nThere are specialized black lights that emit the necessary band of UV light. These black lights are not the typical black light, instead, they are found in stores that specialize in reptile care. Make sure the reptile can stand withing 8 - 10 inches of the lamp in order to benefit from the UV as it doesn't transmit much further than this and the beneficial levels drop off. Change the UV bulb every 6 months as the UV emission degrades after this time.",
                "Create the right temperature. Lights in the cage will be the main source of heat in the enclosure, but you may add additional, more area specific, heating implements. Keeping the temperature in the cage regulated is critical to maintaining the health of your water dragon.[10][11]\n\nTemperatures in the cage, during the day, should be kept at around 84-88°F. Night temperatures should be lowered down to 75-79°F\nYou should also provide a secondary heating source, such as a well secured basking light. The temperature under the light should reach around 90-95°F.",
                "Place a good substrate in the enclosure. You will need some organic material to cover the bottom of your water dragons enclosure. Water dragons need a specific kind of substrate that best mimics its natural environment.[12][13]\n\nIdeally, you will want a substrate that is affordable and easily cleaned or replaced.\nNewspaper or Astroturf are common substrates.\nA mixture of sand and peat is also recommended, although difficult to clean. If you do use sand, purchase special fine grade sand marked as safe for reptile use on the packaging. Otherwise, if ingested, it can cause serious bowl blockages.\nAvoid cedar shavings, wood shavings, gravel, potting soil, or cat litter if they contain vermiculite, pesticides, or fertilizer.",
                "Get a big enough container. The size of your water dragon's enclosure will need to be big enough to allow your water dragon to move and live in comfortably. A cage that is too small may present a health hazard for your water dragon.[14]\n\nGenerally, the enclosure should be as high as it is long. The width should be half the hight.\nWater dragons can grow to a large size. For an adult water dragon you will need to have a cage of around 6' long, 6' tall, and 3' wide.",
                "Add some decorations. You will want to keep your water dragons enclosure an interesting and safe place. In the wild, water dragons want to climb and explore. Recreating the natural environment will allow your water dragon to feel comfortable in its new home.[15]\n\nProvide branches for your water dragon to climb on. Avoid any wood types that are sticky or exude sap.\nGive your water dragon a safe place to hide. This can be as simple as a cardboard box. Provide many hiding spots in the enclosure.\nPlace plants within the water dragons environment. Make sure the plants are non-toxic to your water dragon, such as hibiscus or staghorn ferns.\nBe aware of the soil that the plants are grown in as well, avoiding any that contain vermiculite, pesticides, or fertilizer.",
                "Keep up with cleaning the cage. As with any animal kept in captivity, cleaning the enclosure and maintaining proper hygiene will help keep both you and your pet in good health. Keeping a good schedule when it comes to cleaning the cage will make it easier to remember this important task.[16]\n\nAlways wear gloves when cleaning the cage.\nRemove feces, skin sheds, leftover food, and water spills daily.\nClean food and water bowls daily.\nAn entire cage cleaning should be done weekly.\nRocks should be cleaned and boiled for around thirty minutes.\nBranches should cleaned and then heated in an oven at 200°F for around 30 minutes.",
                "Understand that water dragons can get big. Water dragons can grow quite large, and you should feel comfortable handling a large lizard. You will also need the right amount of space to dedicate to an enclosure that will comfortably house your new water dragon.[17]\n\nAdult males will grow to about 3 feet in length.\nAdult females will reach around 2 feet in length.",
                "Realize that a water dragon is a long term commitment. Water dragons can live up to fifteen years in captivity. Caring for a water dragon is a commitment that you should be prepared for. Do not acquire a water dragon if you do not feel like you can commit this amount of time to caring for one.[18]",
                "Read over some common health issues. If well cared for, your water dragon should enjoy a long and healthy life. However, you should be observant for any health issues that may arise over the course of your water dragon's life. Visit with your veterinarian regularly to catch some of the more common health issues with water dragons.[19]\n\nLack of calcium or underexposure to UV light can cause metabolic bone disease. This will have the symptom of weakness in the legs or jaw.\nYour water dragon may cause abrasions to its own face by bumping into the walls of the enclosure.\nOverfeeding will cause obesity in your water dragon.\nInjuries or other illnesses may occur at any time. Always monitor your water dragons behaviour to alert you to possible health issues."

        "How to Ask a Girl Out When You Have Been Friends for Years": {
            "intro": "Asking a girl out on a date is extremely nerve-racking for most people, and it can be even more difficult when you’ve been friends with her for a long time. The trick is getting your friend to think of you in a different light before you ask her out, because if she just thinks of you as a friend, she may not be receptive to dating you. But once you take a few steps to create a romantic interest, your friend may start having more intimate feelings about you and be more likely to say yes to a date.",
            "steps": [
                "Look for signs of romantic interest. It can be very difficult to tell if someone is interested in you, especially when it’s a friend that you already have feelings for. However, there are a few signs you can look for that might indicate that your friend feels the same way. Some signs of romantic interest might include that she:[1]\n\nFinds reasons to run into you when you don’t have plans to hang out\nLikes to bring up inside jokes or memories you two share\nFollows and likes a lot of what you do and say on social media",
                "Watch her body language. Body language can say a lot about how people feel, including whether your friend is interested in you the same way you are in her. Body language to watch for that suggests romantic interest includes:[2]\n\nShe might expose her wrists. It's a sign of submission females use to attract males. If she is not wearing long sleeves, it may just be exposing the underside of her wrists by turning one upwards, possibly while holding a wine glass or smoking a cigarette.\nShe might try to close distances between you, such as by sitting beside or across from you, passing you things often, or even edging her drink closer toward you\nTouching her neck and looking at you\nPlaying with the rim of her glass when you're having dinner or drinks\nMaking frequent eye contact with you, even if she looks away after locking eyes",
                "Find out if she's dating anyone. Asking a friend on a date can be risky, and you want to make sure the timing is right before you commit. You should be sure she isn't already seeing someone else, otherwise you might put yourself, her, and your friendship in an awkward position.\n\n\nTo find out if she's dating anyone, try to bring it up casually. Try saying something like, “Have you met anyone interesting on Tinder lately,” or, “So did things ever work out with that guy you were seeing a while back.”\nIf you're not comfortable asking her yourself, you can always ask mutual friends if she's seeing anyone.",
                "Ask her how she feels. One of the simplest and most effective ways to find out if your friend feels the same way that you do is to ask her. It may seem forward, but you will end up with a much more accurate answer than if you try to figure it out on your own. If you're not sure what to say, try:\n\n\n“Have you ever thought about us as more than friends?”\n“If we were to go on a date, where would you take me?”\n“Do you think about us when we aren't together?”\n“Do you have feelings for me beyond friendship?”",
                "Accentuate the features she finds attractive. When you’ve been friends with a girl for a long time, you'll likely have a good idea of the qualities and characteristics she typically finds attractive in a person. If you have any of these qualities, emphasize them when you spend time with her.[3]\n\nFor example, if your friend finds humor to be an attractive quality and thinks you're funny, tell even more jokes when she's around.\nSimilarly, if there are particular physical characteristics that your friend likes, wear clothes that emphasize that part of your body when you're together.\nWhile it’s good to accentuate qualities that you already have, it’s important that you don’t pretend to have certain qualities just to impress your friend. She will likely see through your ruse, and if she doesn’t, you'll be stuck pretending to be someone you aren't.",
                "Flirt with her. Flirting is a great and subtle way to suggest that you're interested and to arouse new feelings in your friend. This is important because you have to get her to see you as a possible love interest, rather than just a friend. There are a number of ways you can flirt with her, including:[4]\n\nOrient your body to face her when you two are talking, and lean in slightly when you're engaged in conversation.\nSit closer to her than you normally do when you're together.\nMake frequent eye contact with her, and allow your gaze to linger.\nLaugh often around her and smile at her frequently",
                "Treat her like a love interest. One major thing that will have to change in order for your friend to see you as a love interest is that you'll have to start treating her like one. This includes:\n\n\nComplimenting and flattering her\nPaying for meals and drinks now and then\nGiving her your undivided attention\nNot talking about other women that you're attracted to\nPicking her up and driving her home sometimes",
                "Initiate more physical contact. One of the biggest things that may change between you and your friend if you start dating is the amount of physical contact you share. You can start by:[5]\n\nTouching her arm or hand more often\nTouching her back or shoulders\nGrazing her foot with yours\nResting your hand on her leg briefly[6]",
                "Go on date-like outings. This means engaging in activities that you would normally reserve for someone you were dating. You can do this without actually asking your friend out yet. Instead, when you're planning time together, suggest date-type outings and events.[7] This could include:\n\n\nHaving dinner at a romantic restaurant\nGoing dancing\nSeeing a movie together\nCooking for her at your house",
                "Be prepared for the consequences. Friendships can be delicate, and unrequited romantic feelings can cause awkwardness. Asking out a friend can change the friendship, change group dynamics with mutual friends, and can even end the friendship.\n\n\nBe aware that asking your friend out might strain the relationship, and you may not see each other for a while.\nOnce you ask your friend out, she may not feel comfortable being friends with you anymore.\nEven if you want to keep it private, your mutual friends might find out as well, and relationships with them could also become strained.[8]",
                "Pick the right time. While you might ask a stranger out on a date in front of other friends, the dynamic is different when it’s someone you're already friends with. When you're planning to ask her, make sure that:[9]\n\nShe’s in a place where she's comfortable\nYou can both leave separately if necessary\nYou're alone or not around other friends",
                "Don’t make a confession. Avoid approaching the subject like you have a secret you want to tell her, and don’t start by saying you’ve had feelings for her for a while.\n\n\nInstead, ask your friend out just like you would if she were any other crush.[10]",
                "Be confident. No matter how nervous you are, on the outside you should try to act like this is any other meeting between you two. Act as though you know she's going to say yes, and when you ask her out:[11]\n\nBe direct\nLook her in the eyes when you ask, not at the ground\nTry not to be too nervous, and avoid fidgeting\nStand or sit up straight\nKeep your chin up",
                "Ask her on a date. While you should broach the topic of the date with your friend like you would anyone else, you might want to make the proposition a little more special. Since you know her and know what she likes, customize the date for her.[12] Be sure to include a specific time and date. To ask her out, say something like:\n\n\n“I know you’ve been dying to try that new restaurant, and I want to take you there at 8 p.m. this Saturday, just you and me. What do you say, is it a date?”\n“You keep talking about that adventure. Let’s go on a date this Sunday at noon and I’ll take you.”",
                "Be clear about what you want. When you’ve been friends with someone for a long time, asking her to hang out with you could seem like any other platonic get-together.[13] Make sure you say that you want to go on a date with her, and be clear that the date is romantic.\n\n\nDo not use the term “hang out,” or she may think you mean any old get-together.\nMake sure you use the word “date” when you ask her out.\nBe sure to mention it will just be the two of you.\nIf she asks you something like, “You mean you want to go on a date,” answer with a confident “yes.”",
                "Explain how important your friendship is. Often times, people don’t want to date friends because they cherish the friendship and worry about how a date or break-up could change things. Reassure your friend that the friendship is important to you too, and that you don’t want to lose her, but want to take the relationship to a deeper level.[14] You can say something like:\n\n\n“Your friendship means more to me than a romantic relationship, and I don’t want to risk that, but still want to ask you out”\n“I want to be friends with you no matter what, even if you aren't interested”\n“I still want to be friends, but am also curious about what we’d be like on a date together.”",
                "Play it cool if she says no. The situation will only be awkward if you allow it to be, so you must go in to this prepared for her to say no. Continue on with your friendship as you normally would.[15]\n\nBe patient as well. It’s entirely possible that she said no because your question caught her off guard. After having some time to think about it, she may realize she actually does have feelings for you."

            "intro": "Perfect for night or day, an amaretto sour is a tangy cocktail with a hint of almond. This sweet and sour drink is so delicious that you may forget you're drinking alcohol. You can enjoy it on its own or pair this fancy cocktail with a slightly sweet dessert, such as tiramisu. If you want to know how to make your own amaretto sour, see Step 1 to get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice cubes. This doesn't have to be done perfectly.",
                "Pour your desired amount of amaretto into the shaker. Some people insist on making an amaretto sour with one part amaretto and one part sweet and sour mix, while others make it with two parts amaretto and one part sweet and sour mix. It depends on what you want: more of a sweet and sour flavor, or more of a nutty, creamy flavor. You can use any type of amaretto, though Lazzaroni and DiSoronno are among the tastiest.",
                "Add the sweet and sour mix. If you're going for a 2-1 amaretto to sour mix ratio, then you'll want 1½ of amaretto and ¾ oz. of sweet and sour mix. If you want a 1-1 ratio, then you should pour 1½ oz. of amaretto and 1½ of sweet and sour mix. The sour mix is really a combination of water, sugar, and lemon juice. For an extra kick, you can even make your own. Fresh lemons instead of the pre-made stuff can really take this drink to the next level.[1]",
                "Shake well. Shake the strainer to combine the ingredients together nicely.",

                "Garnish. You can garnish this tasty drink with an orange slice, a lemon wedge, or a maraschino cherry or two.",
                "Serve. Enjoy this tasty cocktail on its own or with some fruit, dessert, or other sweet snacks.",
                "Pour all of the ingredients in a shaker and shake it well. All you need is amaretto, bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a beaten egg white. Shake for at least 15 seconds to fully combine the ingredients.[2]",
                "Put cracked ice into the shaker and shake it again. This will cool off the ingredients after you've already thoroughly combined them.",
                "Strain the ingredients over fresh ice. The drink is best enjoyed in an old fashioned glass. For an extra touch, you can cover the rim of the glass in lemon juice and then dip it in sugar to line the glass with sweetness.",

        "How to Write a Consulting Contract": {
            "intro": "Consultants perform a number of services for people or organizations that hire them. Before a consultant is hired, they often create and execute a consulting contract, which lays out the duties of all the parties involved. In order to create an effective consulting contract, you will have to understand your state's contract law, contemplate the contract, write the contract, then execute the contract. Follow the steps in this article and adapt where necessary in order to create the best consulting contract possible.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine whether you have the need for a consulting contract. A contract is a legally enforceable agreement.[1] You will write a consulting contract if you are looking to hire a consultant or if you are a consultant looking to be hired. A consultant is someone who provides professional or expert advice.[2]",
                "Determine whether you have the ability to enter into a consulting contract. You will need to decide if you have the legal capacity to enter into a valid contract, which involves knowing what you are getting yourself into by entering into the agreement.[3] Also, you will want to know what is needed to create a legally binding contract. Those requirements include:\n\n\nAn offer;\nAcceptance;\nValid consideration;\nMutual assent; and\nA legal purpose.[4]",
                "Ensure the terms and provisions you want to put in your contract comply with your state's laws. Contract law is always going to be state law, so you will need to make sure you meet your state's requirements.\n\n\nFor example, some states have strict laws regarding liquidated damage provisions while other states allow them more freely.[5]",
                "Start with your basic information. This will include the title of your contract and the parties making the agreement. When writing this section, be sure to include detailed descriptions of the parties.\n\n\nFor example, if the parties are people, you will include first and last names. If a party is a company, you will want to provide the company's name, address, and tax identification number if possible. Be sure to clearly indicate how each party to your contract will be referred to in the rest of your contract as well (e.g., \"hereinafter referred to as consultant\").\nCommonly, a consultant will be an individual entering into a contract with a company looking for the consultant's services. For instance, a law firm may hire an individual consultant who has expertise in hiring and firing practices.",
                "Detail the consideration each party is providing. In short, clear, readable paragraphs, explain what each party is providing under your contract. At this point, there is no need to get incredibly detailed. Most of the time you only have to state that one party is providing consulting services and the other party is providing compensation.\n\n\nFor example, an acceptable provision may state: \"The customer is of the opinion that the consultant has the necessary qualifications, experiences and abilities to provide services to the customer. The consultant is agreeable to providing such services to the customer on the terms and conditions set out in this agreement. In consideration of the matters described above...\"[6] This type of language is used to ensure that the requirement for valid consideration is met.",
                "Define the consulting services to be performed. Specify exactly what the consultant will be required to do under your contract. Be detailed in your specifications and include as much information as possible.\n\n\nThis section may start with something like this: \"The customer hereby agrees to engage the consultant to provide the customer with services consisting of (x, y, and z). The services will also include any other tasks the parties may agree on. The consultant hereby agrees to provide such services to the customer.\"[7]\n\nCommon services include litigation support, asset management, process improvement, and second opinions.[8]",
                "Include a compensation provision. You must decide how the consultant will get paid. Some contracts may require periodic payments while others may require one lump sum payment at the end of the consulting. Whatever you choose, make sure it is detailed clearly in your contract.\n\n\nIf paying periodically, think about including something like this: \"For the services rendered by the consultant as required by this agreement, the customer will provide compensation to the consultant of $XX.XX per hour.\"[9]\n\nIf paying in one lump sum, try something like this: \"The compensation will be payable upon completion of the services.\"[10]",
                "Decide whether the consultant will be an employee or independent contractor. This distinction is important and you should spell out how the consultant will be treated in your contract. Most of the time a consultant will be an independent contractor. If you are making the consultant an independent contractor, make that relationship clear by spelling out how and why the consultant will keep his or her independent status. Include language that the consultant will waive his or her right to regular employee benefits such as sick leave, vacation time, health benefits, and anything else you can think of that a full-time employee would receive.\n\n\nConsultants are most often going to be categorized as independent contractors. This ensures that the company or the individual hiring the consultant has a minimum level of responsibility over the consultant. This can be a good thing and it often means there will be less hoops to jump through in order to start and maintain the contractual relationship (i.e., less tax and reporting responsibilities). For instance, if you characterize the consultant as an independent contractor, the independent contractor may not have to report their income, up to a certain amount, to the IRS for tax purposes.",
                "Define the length of the contractual agreement. Here you will include a section defining when the consulting services will begin and when they will end.\n\n\nAn acceptable provision may state: \"The term of this agreement will begin on the date of this agreement and will remain in full force and effect until the completion of the services, subject to earlier termination as provided in this agreement. The term of this agreement may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties.\"[11]",
                "Write a termination provision. This section will provide information on how you can terminate the agreement before the total completion of services. Include how much notice will have to be given and how termination will affect compensation.\n\n\nFor example, your provision may end up looking like this: \"This Agreement may be terminated by either party, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other; provided that if consultant terminates this agreement, consultant shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, nevertheless wind up in an orderly fashion assignments for the customer which consultant began prior to the date of notice of termination hereunder. Upon termination of this agreement for any reason, consultant shall be entitled to receive such compensation and reimbursement, if any, accrued under the terms of this agreement, but unpaid, as of the date consultant ceases work under this agreement. In addition, consultant shall be reimbursed for any non-cancellable obligations, any cancellation penalties, and, unless consultant terminates the agreement without cause, any expenditures reasonably made in order to perform the services that were to occur had cancellation not occurred.\"[12]",
                "Include any miscellaneous information and boilerplate provisions. Towards the end of your contract you will include any standard provisions that are usually found in contracts. Most of these provisions you can simply take from a form contract you find, but make sure you read over them and ensure they say what you want them to. Some of these provisions may include:\n\n\nSeverability provisions\nModification provisions\nIndemnification provisions\nChoice of law provisions\nEntire agreement provisions",
                "Make an area for signatures. At the very end of the contract you will make space for all parties to sign the contract. This area should have spaces for your signatures and dates.",
                "Offer your contract to the other party. Once you have written your consulting contract you will offer it to the other party. The other party will then have a number of options:\n\n\nThe other party may accept the offer in full. In this instance, you will then sign the contract and start performing.\nThe other party could reject the offer in full. If this is the case, you will have to write a more acceptable contract to the other party or find someone else to try to contract with.\nThe other party might try to negotiate some of the terms of your contract. If this happens, you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement.",
                "Negotiate any differences about the terms of your contract. When you negotiate over the terms of your consulting contract, it will most likely be over payment for services and/or the types of services the consultant is going to perform. These will be common areas of tension because they are the main parts of your contract.",
                "Sign your contract and begin performing. When you and the other party are satisfied with the document, you will both sign it and begin performance in the manner you both agreed upon."

        "How to Lose Weight With the DASH Diet": {
            "intro": "The DASH diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, is mainly used to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but it may also help you to lose weight. This diet emphasizes the consumption of foods that are low in cholesterol and saturated fat. It encourages eating a lot of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods. If you are looking to lose weight with the DASH diet, all you need to do is understand how the diet is structured and modify the diet to suit your weight loss needs. You will start seeing results in a few weeks to months’ time.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Keep a food diary. In it, record your current daily eating habits. Write down what you eat for every meal of the day, and take note if you skip a meal. If you regularly skip breakfast, jot this down as well. Also write down any snacks you eat, even if you do this mindlessly - say, while watching TV. This diary will allow you to see where you stand right now in terms of eating practices and where you can start to make changes.[2]",
                "Calculate your calorie needs. You can do this by determining your physical activity level. If your plan is to lose weight, you will need to eat fewer calories than you burn or burn more calories than you eat by staying physically active. Visit the NIH DASH Eating Plan website at [1] for a helpful chart to help determine your daily calorie needs.\n\n\nFor example, a 35 year old male with a moderate activity level will need between 2,400-2,600 calories per day, whereas a 55 year old woman with a sedentary lifestyle will need about 1,600 calories daily.[3]",
                "Transition to the DASH diet gradually. Changing too much at once can be destabilizing and can make you crave your old diet, leading to rebounds. Slow changes, on the other hand, will be barely noticeable, so pace yourself as you adapt your diet and you won’t even notice a thing - you’ll just reap the healthy benefits.[4]",
                "Consult the NIH guide to the DASH diet. Do this prior to starting on the diet so that you know what to expect and can prepare your meals accordingly. The Description of the DASH Eating Plan on the NIH website provides a sample servings guide that you could follow.[5]",
                "Reduce fat consumption. The DASH diet involves reducing the consumption of saturated and trans fats. These are types of fats which raise the level of cholesterol in your blood, which is dangerous in itself, as high levels of LDL cholesterol increase your risk of stroke and heart disease, and can also lead to weight gain.[6]\n\nFoods encouraged by the diet are low-fat dairy products, fat-free products, fish, beans, nuts, fresh poultry, and vegetable oils.\nFoods you should avoid while on the DASH diet include full-fat dairy products, fatty meats, and tropical oils, including coconut oil.",
                "Consume less sugar. The DASH diet suggests reducing the consumption of sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages like soda. Simple replacements, like opting for water instead of juice or reaching for an apple when you would have otherwise eaten a donut, are good ways to get less sugar in your system.\n\n\nYou don’t need to deprive yourself of sweets entirely. Just limit consumption to five or fewer servings per week.[7] However, this does not mean you can eat five pieces of cake per week. Make sure to count things like the sugar you add to your coffee, jam you put on your toast, and anything else that contains sugar.",
                "Reduce sodium intake. The main way to do this is to opt for lean meats, fresh poultry, and fish instead of high-sodium foods like ham or bacon. As a whole, the DASH diet involves limiting daily sodium levels to 2,300 mg. You can also drop sodium intake to 1,500 mg if recommended by your doctor.[8]\n\nAnother way to reduce sodium intake is to avoid adding salt when cooking pasta or rice or when flavoring food.\nRead food labels when shopping and opt for foods that are low in sodium.",
                "Increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Aim to eat 4-5 servings of vegetables as well as 4-5 servings of fruit per day.[9]\n\nVegetables you could add to your diet include tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes. These don’t have to be side dishes - they can be thrown into recipes like stir-fries or served over dishes like brown rice.\nThere is a wide array of fruit that you could add to your diet, from apples to pears to kiwis or oranges. Bananas are also great choices, as they are high in potassium. Many fruits are high in fiber and low in fat, so it’s wise to eat a piece of fruit with every meal plus another fruit daily as a snack.\n\nKeep in mind that foods that are high in fiber can cause temporary bloating and diarrhea. To prevent this, transition to the DASH diet gradually and increase intake of water as you add more fruits and vegetables.",
                "Include more whole grains. Eating whole grains that are high in fiber is an important part of the DASH diet. Aim for six to eight servings of whole grains every day.[10]\nFor example, you can start your day with oatmeal, use whole grain bread to make a sandwich at lunch, and have some brown rice as a side dish with dinner.",
                "Substitute unhealthy snacks with fruit. Studies have shown that keeping unhealthy snacks out of reach and healthy snacks, like fruit, nearby leads to healthier eating habits. So when you are craving cookies, eat a medium apple instead. You’ll satiate your hunger in a healthy way that is conducive to weight loss.[11]",
                "Eat smaller portions. Studies have shown that eating smaller portions throughout the day leads to weight loss. So, if you are craving a hamburger, by all means eat it - depriving yourself will only lead to unhappiness. However, do make it a 3 ounce burger rather than a 6 ounce one. [12]",
                "Go for low-fat options. Opt for fat-free dressings or condiments, which will reduce your waist size in the long run.[13]\n\nLow-fat options don’t always mean fewer calories. Check the food label to compare caloric values of different items.",
                "Distribute your caloric intake. If you notice that you tend to overeat during certain meals, cut back on the amount of food you consume during said meal or redistribute the calories throughout the day.\n\n\nFor example, if you eat a light lunch and a heavy dinner, consider eating a heavier lunch and a lighter dinner. This will give your body a chance to process the calories throughout the afternoon rather than at night, so you’ll burn off those calories more easily.[14]",
                "Control portion size. Ideas for how to do this include downsizing your dishes, eating without watching TV or being otherwise distracted, and keeping unhealthy food out of sight. An important component of the DASH diet is also to eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. This is a way to reduce the risk of overeating and to distribute your energy evenly during the day.\n\n\nThe DASH diet is not for everyone. However, even if you do not subscribe to the entire DASH diet, you can still use portion control as a weight-loss mechanism.",
                "Exercise frequently. Regular exercise reduces your risk for a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, and is a great way to keep your weight down.[15]",
                "Limit alcohol intake. Alcohol is high in calories, with some mixed drinks containing as many calories as a meal, and can contribute to weight gain.[16]",
                "Get enough sleep. Keeping to a regular sleep schedule and sleeping about 8 hours a day has been proven to help maintain a lower percentage of body fat and promotes overall good health.[17]",
                "Speak with your doctor. If you notice that you are unable to lose weight, consult with your doctor and ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian. This may be due to a health condition such as hypothyroidism or Cushing’s syndrome.[18]"

        "wikiHow to Lean in for a Kiss": {
            "intro": "It’s normal to feel nervous before kissing someone you like. One of the most intimidating parts of the kiss is the anticipation. There is a moment, right before you lock lips, where you have to make the decision to go for it. To make sure that everything goes smoothly, learn how to lean in for your next kiss perfectly.",
            "steps": [
                "Touch their face. This is a really sweet and romantic gesture that will let them know you are leaning in for a kiss. You don’t have to do this step, but it might give you that little extra courage to go in for the kiss. Put your hand on their jaw or push their hair behind their ear. You can even softly angle their face towards yours.[1]",
                "Get the “OK.” No, they don’t have to actually say, “Yes, I would like to kiss you, please proceed.” Instead, check out your partner’s body language to determine if they’re comfortable with kissing. If they lean in with you, they want to kiss just as badly as you do. When you touch them and get closer, make sure they seem genuinely interested and happy about these advances. Look to see if they’re glancing at your lips. Finally, see if they’re licking their own lips, as if to prep them for a smooch. Use your common sense to make sure that you have permission to go ahead![2]",
                "Adjust your height. In other words, lean down if your partner is shorter than you, or lift your head upwards if they're taller. If they're much taller, you may even need to get on your tip toes! It can be intimidating to kiss someone who is much shorter or taller than yourself, but it's very manageable. The important thing is to \"meet halfway,\" so make sure you angle yourself so that you're closer to their height.\n\n\nIf you're still nervous about a big height difference, Google \"Shaquille O'Neal and Nicole Alexander kiss.\" If the 7'1\" basketball star and his 5'2\" girlfriend can kiss, you won't have a problem.[3]",
                "Cock your head. One of the biggest concerns when it comes to leaning in for a kiss is bumping noses. To avoid this, you need to make sure your face and your partner's face are cocked in opposite directions. You don't need to bend your neck at a ninety degree angle– keep it natural. If their head is already leaning to one side, casually tilt your head to the opposite side. If they are looking straight at you, with no tilt, choose a side, tilt your head, and they will take their cue from you.",
                "Relax your lips. Despite calling tightly pursed lips the \"kissy face\" in photos, this is not how you should actually kiss. Close your lips, but keep them relaxed. If you form your mouth into a tight pout, you'll look like a cartoon fish coming in for a kiss, and that won't entice your crush. Keep your lips relaxed until they're almost touching your partner's, and then you can slightly purse them. Just try to keep them feeling soft and gentle.\n\n\nIt may sound silly, but practice kissing the back of your hand. Practice kissing gently, avoiding a tight pucker.",
                "Close your eyes. Once you’re close to their face, it’s time to shut your eyes and go for it.[4] Keeping your eyes wide open is a rookie mistake. As soon as you know where your mouth is going, shut your eyes. Don’t close them prematurely, or you could end up kissing their chin or their nose.",
                "Kiss. Whether it’s a quick peck or a long, movie-quality make-out, you’ve successfully leaned in for a kiss. Congratulations! Once you’ve had that initial kiss, you will probably feel more comfortable reading their signals and leaning in for a kiss in the future.",
                "Get closer. Edge towards them on the couch or walk up closer to them. Just do something to show them that you want to be near them. As you get closer to them, start speaking more softly and more slowly. The idea is to make the situation feel more intimate. By getting closer and talking more quietly, they’ll know that you only have eyes on them.[5]",
                "Touch them. Initiate some sort of physical touch, whether it’s romantic or not. Hold their hand, rest your arm or leg against theirs, or even just find an excuse to touch their shoulder or back. Once you’ve had that first physical contact, you’ll become more comfortable. Think about big kissing scenes in movies: the two actors are typically touching in someway before the kiss occurs. Bridge the gap, and find a way to touch the person you want to kiss.[6]\n\nIf they react well to your touch, that’s a great sign. Obviously, if they pull away or look uncomfortable, respect that. That’s a great way to know they aren’t ready to kiss, without getting rejected in a bigger way.",
                "Look at their lips. This will let them know you’re thinking about kissing them, and that you want to be kissed. Don’t stare like laser beams, without blinking or glancing into their eyes. Just continuously glance down at their mouth as you touch, get closer, and continue talking.[7] They should get the idea.",
                "Find somewhere private. It’ll be easier to lean in for that kiss if you’re somewhere secluded and quiet. You don’t have to be the only people there, but you shouldn’t be in a large crowd of friends. Go somewhere where you can chat, and there is a more intimate vibe. Even if you’re at a party, try to go somewhere quiet where you can feel alone.[8]",
                "Be prepared for the kiss. Make sure your lips are not chapped or cracked– that can be a major kissing turn-off. Keep your breath fresh, by brushing regularly and bringing mints or gum with you.[9] If you’re a lady, you may want to avoid the bold, thick lipsticks. These can intimidate a male who isn’t sure what will happen to that make-up if he goes in for a kiss.[10]",
                "Be obvious, if you need to. If you’ve been eager to kiss your crush for awhile and it’s just not happening, despite following all of these tips, you may need to just throw “hints” out the window. If you really want a kiss, and you know your partner is interested too, say it! They might be shy, but at least it’ll get your intentions out there and you can figure out if it’s going to happen or not. If you’re feeling really bold, say something like, “So, if I haven’t made it obvious, I’d really love to kiss you.” Then, if you get a smile or a “Same!” go for it!"

        "wikiHow to Achieve Short Term Goals": {
            "intro": "Not every goal in life requires months or years of work. In fact, some goals must be achieved in a much shorter period of time—sometimes in a matter of weeks, days, or even hours. These goals can be extremely important, often as part of the process of achieving a bigger goal.[1] Short-term goals tend be simpler than long term goals, but may still be a challenge to achieve. Keeping your focus and acting in a timely manner are crucial for achieving short-term goals.",
            "steps": [
                "Make sure the goal is specific. For any goal, it is important that your goal is specific and clearly defined. The work you will do to achieve short-term goals occurs over a shorter, so it's important to avoid confusion about what you are trying to achieve. Confusion creates delay and decreases motivation.[2]\n\nFor example, imagine you are writing a book. To make the process manageable, you decide to break it down into several short term goals. You hope to achieve them over several one-month periods of time. You could set the short term goal \"start writing the book\" for the first month. But, that's not very specific. A better goal might be \"write a first draft of chapter one this month.\" This is much clearer in terms of exactly what you want to achieve.",
                "Make sure the goal is realistic. It is important to set goals that you will actually be able to achieve in the available time. Failure to do so will result in discouragement, which may lead you to give up on future goals.[3]\n\nOur brains thrive on success. Setting achievable goals and following through will create motivation to pursue the next goal.[4] Setting a goal you can't achieve within the time frame sets you up for the opposite.\nReturning to the example of writing a book, you would probably not want to set a goal to complete the first six chapters in a month. Unless the chapters are very short, that's probably more writing than you can produce in that time. Failing to achieve this goal may then discourage you from doing a more reasonable amount of writing the following month.",
                "Determine the steps. Nearly every goal can be broken down into smaller steps. Knowing what those steps are can help the goal feel more manageable. It also can help you create a clear plan to follow in working toward the goal.[5]\n\nFor example, let's say you've got company coming over and your house needs a serious cleaning. You break the process down into several short-term goals: clean the bathroom, clean the kitchen, clean the living room, etc. But, you can break each of these down into steps as well. Using the kitchen as an example, you might need to wash dishes, clean the counters, clean out the fridge, and sweep and mop the floor.",
                "Estimate how long you expect each step to take. Having a timeline and deadlines for these tasks will help keep you motivated, accountable and on-task.[6]\n\nFor example, if you are starting with cleaning the bathroom, you might estimate it will take you 15 minutes to clean the tub, another 15 to clean toilet, another 10 ten to clean the sink area, ten minutes for organizing and cleaning the medicine cabinet, and another 10 minutes to clean the floor. If you can stick to this timeline, you should be able to clean the bathroom in an hour.",
                "Sketch out a plan. Once you've determined the steps, write up a quick plan that puts them in a logical order that will be easy to follow.[7]\n\nIt may seem silly to write down the steps for a simple task like cleaning your house. Indeed, you might not need to. But doing so helps make the goal more tangible, which can build motivation.\nWriting the steps down also ensures you won't forget anything important.",
                "Set priorities. Often times, when dealing with short-term goals, we may have many goals at one time. It is important to decide which goals are most important so that you can achieve them first.[8]\n\nIf company is coming to visit, you may need to clean your house. But, you might also need to stock up on groceries. You might want to clean your car. It might be a good idea to make plans for things to do while your friends are staying with you. You may need to get ahead on work that you won't be able to while they are visiting. If you try to do all these things at once, you won't work as efficiently as if you picked the most important task, finished it, and moved on. In fact, by trying to do all of these things at once, you might not finish any of them.\nPrioritizing your goals will also avoid wasting time after you've completed a goal. You will have already figured out what you need to do next.",
                "Get to work. As with any goal, short term goals are only accomplished through putting in time and effort. Once you get started, you'll develop momentum that can help carry you through to the end.[9]\n\nIf your house is a real disaster, it may be hard to get started on the cleaning. But, look at your plan and try to dive in on the first step as soon as you can. Once you've got one room clean, the satisfaction you feel will help you fell motivated to keep going.",
                "Stay focused. To achieve any goal, you have to work on it steadily. With short-term goals, this is even more important. Because you don't have long to complete your goal, it's crucial to keep your eye on the prize and not get distracted. There are several ways to promote this.\n\n\nTrack your progress. Keep one eye on the clock (or calendar) and one eye on the plan you wrote up for achieving your goal. The timeline you set for yourself can be a strong motivation to stay focused.[10] No one likes to feel that they've failed.\nCreate a good environment for success. Try to remove things from your environment that might prevent you from achieving your goals.[11] Imagine you are trying to clean your house, but you know that your dog is likely to follow you around begging for attention all day. You might want to take it to the kennel for an afternoon so you can focus. If you don't think you'll be able to resist the temptation to play your favorite video game, put the game controllers in a drawer in another room. Don't take tem out again until you're done working on the goal.",
                "Be flexible. Sometimes, you may find that your work toward short-term goals isn't having the effect you had hoped. Or, once you've been working on something for a while, you might think of a better way to do it than you had planned. If this is the case, don't stick rigidly to the plan for its own sake.[12]\n\nIf a short-term goal is not working out as you expected, or is taking a lot more time than you thought it would, don't be afraid to revise the plan. Having a plan is important, but sometimes, you need to change the order of your steps, remove steps entirely, or add new ones. Sometimes, you might need to drop one short term goal altogether in favor of another one.\nUsing the example of writing a book, you might have a plan to draft the first chapter in a month. But, in writing the chapter, you might come up with a new idea for the book that you hadn't thought of before. If it's a good idea, it might be worth going back and revising your outline to include it. The time this takes might prevent you from achieving your original goal, but if it means a better book, be flexible and revise the plan!",
                "Reward success. When you achieve a short term goal, give yourself a reward. This is called \"reinforcement.\" It helps your brain associate following through on goals with good consequences. This makes it easier to motivate yourself to achieve future goals.\n\n\nReinforcement comes in two types. Positive reinforcement is when you add something good to your life. For example, you might reward your success by going out for a fancy cocktail or dessert. Negative reinforcement is when something unwanted is removed from your life. For example, imagine you you don't like walking your dog. You might make a deal with someone else in your household in which they agree to walk it for you for a day if you achieve your goal.[13]\n\nReinforcing good behaviors is more effective than punishing bad ones. It will increase your motivation to follow through much more.[14]"

            "intro": "Finding a mental health counselor or therapist can be difficult, especially if you have never been through therapy before and do not know where to start. You will need to consider what type of therapist you should see, what your needs are, and whether or not the therapist will accept your insurance. The first meeting that you have with your therapist can also be an opportunity to ask questions and see if you feel comfortable talking to the therapist. As you conduct your search, keep in mind that you might have to try out a few therapists to find one who makes you feel comfortable.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine your needs. Identifying your needs can help you to choose a therapist who has experience working with clients with similar needs. Before you start looking for a therapist, think about why you want to start therapy. You can ask yourself some questions to begin to describe the problem.\n\n\nSome questions to ask yourself may include: What symptoms have you been having? How long has the problem been going on? What areas of your life is your problem affecting (social, family, friendships, work, school, romantic relationships, etc.)? How severe is the problem? Talk out your answers to these questions with a trustworthy friend or family member, or write out your answers to help you identify your priorities for therapy.\nFor example, you might want to see a therapist because you have been crying a lot lately and withdrawing from your friends and family. The problem may have started about six months ago and you might feel like it is affecting your relationships and ability to do your job. You might feel that the problem is somewhat severe.\nOr, you might have noticed that you compulsively spend lots of money on unnecessary items, such as clothes, electronics, or other luxury items. You may estimate that you have been struggling with this problem for over a decade. The behavior might be affecting your relationship with your spouse. You might feel like this problem has gotten worse over the years and that now it is quite severe.\nIf you're seeing someone for mental health issues for the first time, just make sure it's someone you feel comfortable with. If you need a referral for medication later, your mental health counselor or psychotherapist will help get a referral for you to someone who can help you obtain medication.",
                "Consider the different types of mental health professionals. Every type of mental health professional has a slightly different focus. Before you start looking for a therapist, consider the different types of mental health professionals and choose the best one to suit your needs.[1]\n\n\nPsychiatrists (M.D., D.O) are medical doctors that specialize in mental health. They can diagnose and treat mental health problems with medications. Keep in mind that while seeking medication may be helpful as a short term solution to your emotional issues, keep in mind that medication alone will not be enough. You will also need to seek talk therapy from a psychologist or counselor.[2] Also keep in mind that although some psychiatrists have a medication only practice, some psychiatrists also offer psychotherapy. You can ask before you make an appointment to see what a psychiatrist offers.\n\nPsychologists (Ph.D., Psy. D, Ed D.) have a doctoral degree in psychology and may treat or specialize in a number of mental health problems. They are often not able to prescribe medicine unless specially licensed or they work with another provider.\n\nPhysician assistants (P.A.–C) work under the supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist. A physician’s assistant who specializes in psychiatry and who works under the supervision of a psychiatrist may have the ability to diagnose mental health disorders, prescribe medicine, and provide psychotherapy.[3]\n\n\nNurse practitioners (PMHNP) can work in teams with other mental health providers or independently to diagnose and treat mental health illness using medication and, sometimes, counseling.\n\nLicensed professional counselors (L.P.C.) can provide psychological counseling and provide diagnosis of mental health issues. Counselors usually assume a holistic but individualized approach to counseling. They recognize that society impacts the individual's behavior, but what the individual does and how s/he feels is ultimately his/her own responsibility. Counselors do not prescribe medication.\n\nLicensed social workers (L.S.W.) can provide mental health counseling and diagnose mental illnesses. They tend to do this from a systems perspective meaning they look at how the community impacts and can help to reduce the symptoms of distress. Social workers do not prescribe medications.\n\nLicensed marriage and family therapist (L.M.F.T.) can provide mental health counseling and diagnose and treat mental illness. They tend to do this from a family systems perspective meaning they focus most closely on how the individual interacts with his or her family system and how that system impacts the individual. Family therapists do not prescribe medication.",
                "Check the therapist’s license using your state’s website. Before you select a mental health professional, it is important to make sure that you are only considering professionals who are licensed to practice in your state. The best way to find out if someone is licensed in your state is to visit a state website. For example, in Pennsylvania, you would have to check with the PA State Professional Licensing Board to find out if a therapist is licensed to practice in your state.\n\n\nKeep in mind that each state has its own rules about licensing mental health professionals.\nYou can also ask your insurance provider if the professionals that they list are all licensed.",
                "Learn about different therapeutic approaches. Not all therapists use the same methods with their clients. One professional might choose a specific approach over another based on evidence that one approach produces better results for the client’s problem. If you have a preference for a specific type of therapy based on a past experience, then you may want to seek therapists who use these methods. Some therapists may even list their preferred approaches on an online profile. However, most therapists use a variety of different approaches, which can be beneficial if you are not sure what is wrong. Approaches may include:[4]\n\n\nPsychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies. This approach helps you to uncover subconscious motivations for your behavior and to change your behavior, thoughts, and feelings.\n\nBehavior therapy. This form of therapy modifies your behavior by using strategies that attempt to change the way that you learn.\n\nCognitive therapy. In this form of therapy, the goal is to change your thoughts so that your feelings and actions will change as well.\n\nHumanistic therapy. This type of therapy focuses on your ability to make rational decisions and improve yourself.",
                "Ask for a referral. Getting a referral to a therapist from your general practitioner may be necessary for insurance reasons. Therefore, you may need to talk to your general practitioner about how you have been feeling before starting your search.\n\n\nYour general practitioner may also be able to refer you to someone who meets your specific needs. For example, if you are seeking talk therapy from someone who has experience helping compulsive shoppers, then your doctor may be able to point you in the right direction.",
                "Talk to friends and family. Friends and family members who are in therapy may be able to help you find a good therapist.[5] If you know that a friend or family member sees a therapist, then you might consider asking how he or she likes the therapist. If your friend or family member has good things to say, then this therapist might be someone to consider.",
                "Read online profiles and other information about the therapist. Some therapists provide information about their specializations on the internet. Check to see if the therapists you are considering specialize in any of the areas for which you are seeking help.\n\n\nFor example, you may be able to find out whether or not a therapist is willing to work with people who have addiction problems, anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorder.",
                "Check your insurance. Before you make an appointment with a therapist, make sure that he or she will accept your insurance. You may be able to check your insurance carrier’s online directory or you may need to call your insurance company to verify your coverage.[6]\n\nDon’t schedule an appointment until you are certain that the therapist takes your insurance. You can call the therapist before you make an appointment to be sure. Therapy can be extremely expensive if your insurance does not cover at least part of it.",
                "Choose a therapist you can afford. Therapists charge different prices for their time. Make sure that you know their prices and whether or not they take your insurance.\n\n\nCall the therapist's office to find out their prices and whether or not they take insurance. Make sure that you know whether or not you can afford their prices before you meet with them.\nFind out what therapists are part of your health insurance network. You will want to find out if your therapist takes your insurance before you choose a therapist or come for your first visit.\nKnow that if you want to visit a therapist outside of your network, it may be more expensive. Consider the potential cost of a therapist outside of your network as opposed to those approved by your insurance.",
                "Consider practicalities when choosing your therapist. Make sure your therapist is easily available, close by, and can be contacted without much difficulty. If these are not options, it may be useful to try online therapy.\n\n\nChoose a therapist that nearby. This may be a problem if you live in a rural area, but try to find someone that you can visit without too much difficulty.\nMake sure your therapist is accessible. You want to be able to contact when you need to make an appointment or need emergency help.\nContact with your therapist with an inquiry. Explain to them what you’re looking for and ask if they are taking new patients.\nSchedule a consultation with your therapist so you can meet with them in person.\nConsider online therapy if you cannot easily access a therapist or if your schedule will not permit an in-person therapist. Make sure your online therapist is qualified and holds the same accreditations as an in-person counselor.[7]",
                "Set up an appointment. When you have made a decision about the therapist that you want to try, schedule your first appointment. Keep in mind that it might be a couple of weeks before you will have your first appointment.",
                "Describe the feelings and issues that you want to work on. During your first appointment, the therapist will probably ask you to explain why you are seeking therapy. This is your opportunity to provide an overview of how you have been feeling and what problems you have been encountering.\n\n\nYou may want to think about how you will express these things before you go, since it might be a little overwhelming to describe it all on the spot.\nIn your own words, just try to describe how you have been feeling and acting. How long has it lasted? Why does it bother you? What do you hope to accomplish through therapy?",
                "Ask questions. Your first appointment is a good time to ask questions that will help you decide if you want to continue with this therapist. Some questions you might want to ask include:[8]\n\nHow long have you been a practicing therapist?\nHow much experience do you have working with people who share my issues?\nWhat are your specialties?\nWhat are your treatment methods? How effective are these methods?",
                "Provide honest answers. Being dishonest with your therapist can hinder your progress or prevent it entirely. Therefore, it is essential to tell your therapist the truth about your feelings and experiences. Keep in mind that your therapist is not going to judge you or share what you have shared with her.\n\n\nIf you don’t feel comfortable being honest with a therapist, then it might be a sign that you need to try someone else.[9]",
                "Set goals with your therapist. Talk therapy is an effective treatment for many different types of mental health issues, but it takes time and persistence. You and your therapist can set goals and develop a plan for achieving those goals.[10]\n\nFor example, your goal might be to feel less anxious when you go out in public or to stop making major purchases without thinking about them first. Tell your therapist what your goals are and follow through with her recommendations for achieving them.\nKeep in mind that it can take a while to see results, but the results from talk therapy are often more long-term than the results you might achieve by only taking medication.",
                "Pay attention to your therapist's personal qualities. You need to be comfortable with your therapist in order to address your mental health problems.\n\n\nBe aware of your comfort level with the therapist. If you feel comfortable and safe, that’s the best environment for effective counseling.\nConsider if race or gender is an issue in your counseling. Don't limit yourself to the age, gender, or race of the therapist, since you may skip over a very qualified therapist.\nIf your specific mental health problem addresses a unique gender or racial experience, you may want to choose a therapist that may understand your experience first-hand.\nPay attention to the communication style of your therapist. Make sure the way they talk and listen to you feels like you are heard and listened to.\nKeep in mind that therapists are human beings too. Some meetings may not go well. Mental health professionals are not perfect, so try to give them the benefit of the doubt.",
                "Know that not every therapist will work out. If you don’t feel comfortable with a therapist, that’s ok. It’s important to feel comfortable to address your mental health concerns.\n\n\nRealize that your first meeting is just an interview. It’s not the end of the world if the first therapist does not work out.\nAsk for a referral if your initial meeting doesn’t work out. Even if your first meeting did not go well, your therapist may be able to suggest someone that’s a better fit.\nThank the therapist for their time. They took time out to meet you as a new patient. Be grateful for their time and willingness to help. [11]"

            "intro": "Building a website is a great way to share your ideas and thoughts with the world. But if you've never done one, it can seem daunting. There's all that http-dot-whatever and <tag this=\"\"> and <tag that=\"\"> and how do you get pictures and text in there? Well fear not, this article will help you to grasp the intricacies very quickly!",
            "steps": [
                "Get inspired. Look at websites with great designs and think about why they're great designs. It usually comes down to the information, resources, links, and pages being laid out in a way that is easy to see and use. To get ideas about how to design your own site, look at sites which do similar things to get ideas about where you should put different types of content.\n\n\nStay realistic to your skills.\nEase of access is the most important thing. If you don't have a certain piece of information easily visible, make sure that getting to that information is very logical.\nGenerally the simpler the design, the fewer the pages, the better.",
                "Choose a topic and purpose. If you already have a fairly good idea about what your website will focus on, skip this step. If not, here are some things to help you figure that out. First, understand that there are billions of people on the Internet, and a large percentage have websites. If you limit yourself to something that hasn't been done, you'll never get started.\n\n\nWhen you think, \"Internet,\" what is the first thing that comes to your mind? E-commerce? Music? News? Socializing? Blogging? Those are all good places to start.\nYou could create a website that's dedicated to your favorite band, and have a chat area where people can talk about it.\nYou can build a page for your family, but be careful about things like this. The internet is full of unsavory characters and information you put up about your family could end up being used against you. Consider adding password protection to your personal family website.\nIf you're a news junkie, or want something less filtered than traditional media, build a website and get publicly available feeds from news providers such as Reuters, BBC, AP, and others. Build your own customized news aggregator (what used to go by the quaint name of \"newspaper\"), then see and show all the news that's fit to digitize.\nIf you're creative at writing then you can start a blog where you can write about anything you want and attract monthly readers!",
                "Make a plan. Building your website is going to take a commitment of time and possibly money, so set a limit on both, and then dig in. The plan doesn't have to be a big, complicated spreadsheet, or a fancy graphic presentation, but at the very least, you will want to consider what it will do for you and the visitors, what you'll put on the website, what goes where on the webpages.",
                "Gather the content. There are lots of different types of content and many have their own considerations. You'll need to figure out what's best for your website and your needs. Some things to consider including:\n\n\n\nA store. If you want to sell things, you'll need to figure out how you want the items to be available. If you have relatively few things to sell, you might want to consider having a store with a hosting service. Society6, Amazon, and Cafepress are all well-established store hosts which let you sell a variety of items and set your own prices.\n\nMedia. Do you want to display videos? Music? Do you want to host your own files or do you want them hosted somewhere else? Youtube and SoundCloud are great examples of hosting options, but you'll need to be sure that the way you design your website allows these media types to display correctly.\n\nImages. Are you a photographer? An artist? If you plan on putting original images on your website, you might want to use a format that can help keep them from getting stolen. Make sure the images are relatively small or that they are hidden behind some Flash code, so as to keep them from being easily saveable.\n\nWidgets. These are mini-programs which run on your website, usually to help you keep track of who visits, what they're looking for, and where they're from. You can also find widgets for booking appointments, displaying a calendar, etc. Look into what might be useful for you (just make sure the widget comes from a reputable source).\n\nContact information. Do you want to have contact information on your webpage? For your own safety, you should be careful about what kind of information you have available. You should never display things like your home address or home phone number, as information like this can be used to steal your identity. You may want to set up a PO box or a special email address for people to contact you at, if you don't have a business address.",
                "Draw a flow chart. For most people, the website starts on the home page. This is the page that everybody sees when they first go to www.yourSite.com. But where do they go from there? If you spend some time thinking about how people might interact with your site, you'll have a much easier time down the line when you are making navigation buttons and links.",
                "Plan for user devices and situations. In recent years, smartphones and tablets have become incredibly popular platforms for browsing the internet, and they require websites to be designed for them. If you really want to make a website that will stand the test of time and be accessible to the highest number of viewers, plan on making different versions of your site for different devices, or plan to use a responsive design that adjusts as necessary.",
                "Decide what method or tool you'll use to build it. When you have the basic idea down and have a plan for how it will be laid out, the next to think about is how you're going to build it. The options seem endless, and people will try to sell you this or that 'fantastic' application, and every other thing that you \"absolutely must have\" on your site, however the reality is that there are a few great tools for building websites, and one of them will be best-suited to your situation and needs.",
                "Build it yourself. This is the first option. If you have a website-building application like Adobe Dreamweaver, it is not very difficult to create a website from scratch. You might need to do some coding but don't panic! HTML looks complicated, but it's like listening to Shakespeare—it's hard at first, but once you get the feel of it, it's not that difficult.\n\n\nPros: website design software simplifies the process of building sites by letting you drag-and-drop images, text, buttons, movies, and anything else you can think of, usually without ever having to dig into HTML. Many web design applications will even let you create sites specifically for your smart phone or pad. If you are building a basic, personal website, this is really a great way to go.\nCons: there is a learning curve, and though you don't have to dig into HTML, it's not totally geek-free. If you are in a hurry, this might not be the best solution. Perhaps the biggest con, though, is that if you are not a graphic designer, you could end up with a page that hurts the eyes. To mollify this somewhat, there are a number of free templates in the applications, and on the internet, but be aware of your limitations—if you have any!",
                "Use a content management system (CMS). This is the second option. WordPress is an example of a great option for building websites. It helps you create web pages and blog posts quickly and easily, set up the menus, allow and manage user comments, and has thousands of themes and plugins that you can choose from and use for free. Drupal and Joomla are other great CMS options. Once the CMS is hosted, you can manage your site from anywhere (in the world) that has an Internet connection.\n\n\nPros: Very easy to use, quick to get started with one click install, and lots of options for the beginner (with enough depth for more experienced users).\nCons: Some themes are limiting, and not all are free.",
                "Build the website from scratch. This is the third option. If you decide to build your website from scratch, you'll need to start using HTML and CSS. There are ways to extend your HTML skills and add more features and more depth to your website. If you are developing a professional website, these tools will help you get that edge that is needed in any business venture.\n\n\n\nCSS, which stands for \"Cascading Style Sheets\". CSS gives more flexibility for styling the HTML, and makes it much easier to make basic changes—fonts, headers, color schemes—in one place, and have those changes ripple through the site.\n\nXHTML is a web language set by W3C's standards. Almost identical to HTML, it follows a stricter set of rules for marking up information. What this means, for the most part, is minor changes to the way you write code.\nLook into HTML5. It's the fifth revision of the core HTML standard, and will eventually subsume the current version of HTML (HTML4), and XHTML as well.\nLearn a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript. This will increase your ability to add interactive elements to your site, such as charts, maps, etc.\nLearn a server-side scripting language. PHP, ASP with JavaScript or VB Script or Python can be used to change the way web pages appear to different people, and lets you edit or create forums. They can also help store information about people who visit your site, like their username, settings, and even temporary \"shopping carts\" for commercial sites.\nAJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique of using a browser sided language and a server sided language to make the page get new information from the server without refreshing the page, often greatly reducing user wait time and vastly improving the user's experience but increasing bandwidth usage. For a website that will see a lot of traffic, or an eCommerce site, this is an excellent solution.",
                "Hire a professional. This is the fourth and final option. If you are not up to designing your own website, or learning new coding languages—especially for more advanced sites—hiring a professional may be your best option. Before you hire, ask to see a portfolio of their work, and check their references carefully.",
                "Register your domain name. If you’re on a budget, there are strategies for buying a cheap domain name. Find a domain name that is easy to remember and easy to spell. If you use domains ending with .com, you will end up with more traffic, but most of the easy ones are taken, so be creative!\n\n\nLook to Network Solutions, GoDaddy, or Register.com are good in US and uk2.net if you're in the UK to research and find the ideal domain name for your website. Wordpress also includes a feature whereby you can use a name that's tagged with their site, for example, mywebsite.wordpress.com. But if the name you choose is also available as a .com, they will notify you when you sign up.\nYou can purchase domain names if they have been \"parked\" or are for sale online through business sales sites. It's a good idea to get legal and financial advice before purchasing an expensive domain name.",
                "Inspect your website. Before you post your site, it's wise to test it thoroughly. Most web design software has a way to test your site without taking it online. Look for missing tags, broken links, search engine optimization, and website design flaws. These are all factors which may affect your website's traffic and revenues. You may also generate a free full-functioning site map to submit to search engines like Google, in a matter of minutes.",
                "Test your website. When you finish your website, do usability testing. You can do this by asking a few friends or family members to try it out. Give them a specific task like \"edit your profile\" or \"buy an alpaca sweater from the bargains page.\" Sit behind them and watch them navigate—do not help them. You will likely find areas where you need to improve navigation or clarify some instructions. Alternately use something like zurb.com to user test on specific demographics for different types of engagement. When testing a website in 2014 it's becoming important to keep the platform in mind and make sure the website is usable from smartphones and tablets as well as desktops.\n\n\nKeep a list of things you notice that seem difficult or non-intuitive for the user.",
                "Launch it! Choose a web host and upload your website. Your web host may have an FTP feature, or you can download your own FTP program like FileZilla or CyberDuck. If you hired a professional to design the website, they should be able to take care of this for you (but it still pays to ask questions so that you understand what is happening).\n\n\nNote that there are ways to host your own website for free.",
                "Narrow down your concept. If you're doing this for money, which ideas stand to make the most profit? Which ideas require the most commitment? Which ideas look like they'd be fun to pursue? You will be spending time working on your website, so choose the idea you are most passionate about (that is also profitable and practical for you).",
                "Define your goals, and work to achieve them. The website you create may be for fun, it may be for profit, or some combination of the two. Knowing your expectations makes it much easier both to design your website, and to track and make sense of the results.",
                "Be ready for competition. Content sites require less investment but they also face more competition, since anyone can start a content site. To make money from this kind of site, you provide information and generate income from the traffic you receive through advertising, such as through Google AdSense. In order to optimize AdSense, you will have to write your content purposefully and make it interesting so that people come to your site. Use specific keywords directed at people searching for specific terms too; just don't get carried away with this aspect or the content may suffer and readers won't like it.",
                "Be ready for responsibility. eCommerce sites, which sell products, will need more maintenance and attention. You will need to think about shipping, sales, taxes, SSL, inventory updates, and everything that a person with a brick-and-mortar storefront would have to manage. A system for prompt answering of questions and dealing with complaints is essential when selling products online; many companies also offer phone help, which you can outsource offshore if need be.\n\n\nIf the goal is just to add a stream of income, you can also sell other people's products through affiliate programs, letting you earn money without investing in product or worrying about shipping.",
                "Know the audience or market you want to reach. Which kinds of people will your website serve? Conduct market research to figure out more about your audience. Things to know or find out include: What do they do? How old are they? What are their other interests? All of this information can help make your website much more useful. However, be careful of assuming that your site is only targeting one group––always watch for trends that show other types of people becoming interested, so that you can cater for their interests too and make the most of new opportunities.",
                "Do keyword research. This is necessary to determine whether people are searching for topics that are relevant to your site and can be useful for learning more about your potential clients. Making a conscious effort to incorporate in-demand keywords into the site can also help you get a better search engine ranking. There are tools available from Google (ex. google.com/trends/ and google.com/insights/search/#), Overture, and third-party software developers that can make the keyword research process easier.\n\n\nSprinkle the keywords you've chosen throughout your text, but not insofar as it hurts the quality of your content.\nCreating pages that are optimized for the search engines will help you get your site found which is really more important than design. What good is a site that no one sees?",
                "Advertise. Now that it's out there, you want people to come, so let them know!\n\n\nSubmit your site to major search engines. There are sites that will do this for you, or you can do it yourself.\nTell your friends. Tweet about it—constantly! Add it to your Facebook status updates, post pictures of it on Flickr, add it to your LinkedIn account—anywhere and everywhere is the key here. The more people coming to your site, the better.\nUse an e-mail address with your domain. Visit other websites that complement (not compete with) yours, and offer to exchange links or guest blog/write. Post constructively on blogs and forums, and put your URL in your signature.\nUse article marketing. Creating SEO-optimized articles and posting them to other sites is a sometimes a useful way to create back-links to your website. This might help you to boost your website’s search engine ranking but always keep abreast of search engine updates that often impact SEO strategies and can render them less helpful or even downgrade your site's ranking.",
                "Provide quality content and service. Most of all, listen to your readers and customers and learn from their experience with your website.\n\n\nTake constructive comments seriously. Other band members, fans, and friends may all have easier navigation ideas.\nThink about your target market or audience: their needs, their frustrations, their circumstances. As much as possible, seek to make their lives easier or more informed."

            "steps": [

Then, it should remain coated so that you have a non-stick surface for the remaining time you use it.\n\n\nKeep in mind that the darker and “dirtier” the stoneware looks, the better the surface will be for baking. The light coating of oil will stay on the pan, so that you don’t need to add too much oil or fat.[1]"

If the soap suds haven’t started seeping out of the machine and all over your kitchen floor, then stopping it quickly will either keep that from happening or allow you to place towels on the floor to control the mess. Stopping the machine quickly will also keep the remaining dish soap from working its way through your dishwasher’s system. The dishwasher should start draining out once you cancel the cycle.",

Getting them out of the way will make things easier once you start cleaning up the mess. There’s likely dish soap residue all over the dishes, and you need to get rid of as much leftover dish soap as you can in order to gain control of the overflowing soap suds.",

Remove as much water out of the dishwasher as possible. And then wipe the walls, top and bottom of the dishwater to get rid of any leftover suds and dish soap residue.\n\n\nMake sure to wash out the soap dispenser thoroughly, if that's where you put the dish soap.\nYou can also use a wet-dry vacuum, if you have one, to suck out the water and soap suds. But make sure it is rated for wet pickup, and make sure to use only the wet filter.",

                "Run the rinse cycle for a few minutes. Let the rinse cycle run for a few minutes to wash out the remaining dish soap. Soap suds may or may not continue to foam, depending on how effective you were at hand cleaning out the machine and how much dish soap was added to the machine.\n\n\nIf you have enough heavy, dry towels that you don’t mind suds continuing to spill out of your dishwasher, you can keep running the rinse cycle repeatedly until all of the dish soap washes out.[2]\n\nBut if you’d rather a quick fix, try one or more of the following remedies.",
                "Pour ½ to 1 cup of vinegar inside your dishwasher. One way to calm the out of control soap suds in your dishwasher is by using distilled white vinegar. Start by pouring ½ cup of vinegar directly into the bottom of the dishwasher.[3]\n\nLet your dishwasher run for a few minutes on the normal setting. After a few minutes, check inside to see if the soap suds have begun to dissipate. If they haven’t, pour another ½ cup and start the normal wash cycle again.\nIf that still doesn’t help, try adding another cup of vinegar, and repeating the normal wash cycle. Move on to another method if that still doesn’t seem to be working.",
                "Sprinkle a layer of table salt over the soap suds. You can use table salt in conjunction with vinegar to deactivate the foaming agent in the dish soap[4], or you can use table salt by itself.\n\n\nIf you’d like to use the vinegar and salt together, then pour 1 cup of vinegar and about two tablespoons of salt across the soap suds or bottom of the dishwasher. Start the normal cycle of your dishwasher and let it run for a few minutes. If the soap suds appear to be dissipating, then you can allow the cycle to run through. If not, repeat the process until it works.\nIf you are using only table salt, then pour a generous amount atop the soap suds. The salt will break down the soap suds, and work as an anti-foaming agent to prevent more suds from forming. Let the normal cycle of your dishwasher run for a few minutes before checking to see if it’s working.\nIf the soap suds still seem to be growing, pour more salt over them and turn the dishwasher back on. Check again after a few minutes to see if the additional salt is helping. If not, repeat the process until it does.\nOnce you notice either method working, allow the normal cycle to run all the way through in order for the remaining dish soap and suds to wash completely out of the dishwasher’s system.",
                "Add ice cubes to the mix. Using ice cubes along with heaps of table salt may also help to get rid of the overflowing soap suds.[5] If your dishwashing cycle was set to hot, then the hot water is likely helping the soap suds to grow. Pouring in a couple trays of ice cubes will cool down the water and help to settle some of the soap suds.\n\n\nAdd the ice after you add the salt and let the two work together as an anti-foaming agent. Allow the ice to melt.\nDrain your dishwasher of the melted ice and salt, and then start your dishwasher on a rinse cycle. You may need to repeat the process if you still see soap suds after the cycle completes.",
                "Pour a cup of olive oil into the bottom of your dishwasher to clear out the soap suds. Olive oil works also as an anti-foaming agent. In fact, several dishwasher manufacturers recommend it as an effective solution if you happen to pour dish soap into your dishwasher. If you don’t have olive oil, any other cooking oil will also work.\n\n\nOnce you’ve cleaned out your dishwasher, removing as much dish soap, suds and water as you can, pour a cup of olive oil into the bottom of the dishwasher.\nLet the dishwasher run for an entire normal cycle. The heavy oil should break down the soap suds and work to clear out the remaining dish soap residue.",
                "Add a capful of liquid fabric softener to your dishwasher. Another method for clearing dish soap from your dishwasher is to add liquid fabric softener to the machine.[6] Only a capful is needed to help break down the soap suds. After adding the liquid fabric softener, let the dishwasher run on a normal cycle for about a minute to activate the softener. Either press the button to cancel the cycle to allow solution and suds to drain, or change the cycle to the drain cycle."

You can imitate a wolf howl for fun, or you can use the vocalization as a way to determine whether there are wolves nearby. Know that wolves howl most frequently around sunrise and sunset, when they are most active. If you howl in the wild, be prepared for any nearby wolves to come to you!",
            "steps": [
                "Howl to find out if there are wolves nearby. In the wild, wolves howl as a way of communicating with other wolves. However, wolves will often answer a sound that closely resembles an actual howl. Wildlife biologists use fake howling as a research tool to determine whether there are any wolves in a given area: they'll howl into the woods, then record the number of replies.[1]\n\nWolves howl as a territorial defense, as a social activity, and as a means of locating other members of the pack. In groups, wolves howl to motivate and rally one another to move or to hunt.[2]\n\nHowl from a high place that is clear of trees. You want the noise to resonate!\nIf you have access to the Internet, research wolf ranges and populations in your area. Wolves are endangered, and their activity has been well-documented by wildlife biologists.",
                "Howl day or night. It is a common misconception that wolves only howl at the moon – and, indeed, that they only howl at night. Wolves actually howl most frequently around sunrise and sunset, when they are generally more active than other times of the day.[3] If you are trying to get wolves to howl back at you, it may help to howl when they are most active.\n\n\nWolves howl to each other year-round. However, most packs do tend to howl more often in the winter than in the summer.",
                "Decide whether you are howling alone or with a pack. Packs of wolves use a particular howling structure: the alpha wolf begins the howl with one high, piercing note, and then the rest of the wolves gradually join in with various low, mournful pitches. Wolves that howl alone are often trying to locate other members of their pack.",
                "Be careful. Wolves are highly social creatures, and they are very good at pinpointing the origin of a howl. If you howl in the wild and there are wolves nearby, there is a good chance that they will come to you.[4] If you don't want to encounter any wolves, consider leaving the area quickly.",
                "Listen to audio recordings of wolf howls if you can. It will be much easier to imitate the howl if you know what it sounds like![5]",
                "Take a deep breath. Inhale slowly and consistently until your lungs are completely full of air. You'll need a large volume of air to imitate the volume and duration of an actual wolf howl.[6]",
                "Start howling slowly. Cup your hands around your mouth as if you are going to shout. Begin with a low, mournful note, and then quickly increase your pitch by one octave: \"A-woooooooooo!\" Build up the volume of the howl so that it grows louder and louder. Hold the howl for as long as you can – at least a few seconds. As you feel your breath waning, gradually low your pitch and \"fade out\" of the howl.\n\n\nYou can tell what a howl means by its pitch and strength. The longer the howl, the more powerful the emotion. Researchers also use pitch and volume to distinguish between individual wolves.",
                "Howl again. Wolves rarely howl just once. If you want to imitate a wolf pack, then have several friends howl with you. Make sure that some of you howl in lower pitches, and some of you in higher pitches. Each wolf has a unique voice, and other wolves use these slight variations in pitch to identify who is howling.[7]"

        "How to Attract a Cancer Man": {
            "intro": "Present a homely, feminine aura by dressing in a flirty outfit and wearing floral perfume. Speak softly and compassionately. Emphasize your love of family, get to know his own family, and speak of his family members positively. Keep an organized appearance and don't be too spontaneous. Ask him for help and shower him with attention and genuine compliments. Don't contradict or correct him harshly. Try to see him regularly and listen to him attentively.",
            "steps": [
                "Present a traditional feminine aura. Most Cancer men are attracted to women who are highly feminine in a very traditional way. Subconsciously, a Cancer male will be looking for a woman who fits his image of the ideal wife and mother. Everything from your appearance to your mannerisms should ooze femininity.\n\n\nSlip on a sensual, flirty outfit before you approach him, like a dress that hugs your curves in all the right places. Floral perfumes in classic scents, like rose, can also create the perfect feminine ambiance around you.[1]\n\nDon't try to slip in under the radar as \"one of the guys.\" Skip the dirty jokes and witty jabs; instead, speak softly and compassionately. Avoid acting too boyish around him.",
                "Show off your homemaking skills. After you get to know him a little, take the initiative and show off your ability to keep house in a very traditional manner. One of the easiest ways to do this is through cooking. Cook up a meal or treat for him, or invite him over to cook a complex recipe with you.\n\n\nKeep in mind, however, that the Cancer man is a little more withdrawn and may resist your affections if he believes that you're coming on too fast. Inviting him back to your place for a meal the first time you meet him will probably end in rejection. Wait until you have already established some sort of bond with him before you extend an invitation into your home.",
                "Emphasize your love of family. You should talk about the love you have for your current family as well as any dreams you have about marrying and starting a family of your own. Cancer men generally dream of having children someday, so it'll help your case dramatically if your dreams are in line with his.\n\n\nWhen talking about your current family, focus on the maternal side. Talk about things you have learned from your mother or time you have recently spent with your mother. Cancer is a classic mama's boy, and if you can show a love for your mother that rivals the love he has for his own, you can connect to him more easily.[2]\n\nIn addition to all the “mom” talk, converse with him about pleasant family memories and your childhood.",
                "Connect to the people close to him. As long as your Cancer man has a functional family, he will probably be very close to them. The sooner you can get to know his family, the sooner you can attract him as a potential mate.\n\n\nOnce again, the Cancer man tends to be a mama's boy. If you can meet his mother and get on her good side, you can quickly promote yourself in his eyes.\nIf he did not have a good relationship with his family growing up, chances are, it was not by his choice. A Cancer man who did not receive the love of family from his actual family will probably view his circle of friends as his family, instead. In this case, your best bet is to get on good terms with his friends. Focus on his female friends, though, since getting too cozy with his male buddies might cause him to distrust your affection for him.",
                "Talk about his family in a positive way. Invite him to talk about his own family and connect other topics of conversation back to his family as often as possible. Always do so in a positive light, though, and avoid anything that could sound like an insult toward those he loves.\n\n\nFor instance, if you've seen his mother and he shares some resemblance with her, mention it to him.\nYou could also try complimenting the relationship he has with his siblings or remarking on how much you think a certain family member might enjoy the great new band/restaurant/book/movie you're talking about.",
                "Keep a neat, organized appearance. Cancers are neat, orderly guys. As such, they will generally find women who can be equally organized more appealing than those who are complete slobs. Any space you claim in front of the Cancer male should be clean. Even if you are unable to keep up with his level of tidiness, you need to make a good effort at it.\n\n\nIn other words, don't invite him into your personal space if your desk is covered in papers or if your apartment is covered in dirty laundry. You do not need to have everything labeled and filed away into neat little packages, but some basic cleanliness and a lack of clutter will go a long way.",
                "Ask him to help you organize your space. If you do have a cluttered area, tell him about it before he finds out on his own by asking him to help you organize it. The appeal of this petition is three-fold: you'll make him feel needed, you'll appeal to his natural love of organization, and you'll demonstrate a willingness to become less messy and more organized yourself.",
                "Avoid spontaneity. The occasional romantic surprise is fine, but as a general rule, avoid making any sudden wild suggestions or demanding something without any warning. Cancer guys like to keep all aspects of their life organized. This includes both physical space and intangible time.",
                "Ask him for help. Cancers like to assume the traditional male role of provider and protector. Give him the chance to provide for you in some way by asking for his help. The situation does not need to be anything major, but it helps if you choose a task that your Cancer dreamboat usually excels at so that he can complete it thoroughly and impressively.\n\n\nAsk him for help when you move into a new office or apartment, or if you go shopping for a new car. If nothing quite so dramatic lies ahead of you, however, look for smaller excuses. For example, ask his opinion about a dilemma you have at work, even if you've secretly solved the issue yourself.",
                "Satisfy his craving for affection. Even though Cancers like to assume a traditional male role, they are also fairly in touch with their emotions. They crave love on an emotional level, so don't be afraid to shower them with affection. The more your actions demonstrate your affection, the more likely your Cancer man is to respond in kind.",
                "Compliment him. Offer a kind word about his appearance, his skills, or the way he makes you feel. Compliments make your Cancer feel good about himself, and he can appreciate a woman who gives him the sort of buzz you'll provide whenever you tell him how wonderful he is.\n\n\nMake sure that your compliments are genuine and subtle, though. If a Cancer man suspects that you are trying to flatter him, he might become uncomfortable and start to withdraw from you.",
                "Share your feelings.[3] Since Cancer men tend to be on the emotional side, they also have a tendency to feel attracted to women who can be equally expressive in their emotions if not more so. Plus, showing your own willingness to open up can demonstrate how much you want him or need him in your life.\n\n\nRemember that Cancers tend to be insecure. The quickest way to establish a sense of emotional security with your Cancer crush is to make the first emotional investment.",
                "Try not to contradict him. Everyone is wrong sometimes, and the Cancer man is no exception. That said, since Cancers are so emotionally reactive, they tend to lash out when directly contradicted or corrected in a harsh manner.\n\n\nWhen you need to correct him, be tactful and persuasive.[4] Rely solely on reason to make your point and try not to get emotional or reactive.\nSimilarly, when he gets angry or upset, do not lash back in response. Wait for him to calm down on his own rather than trying to force him into a calmer state.",
                "Stay within sight. Oftentimes, real attraction is not instantaneous with a Cancer man. You will need to enter within his field of vision on a fairly regular basis before he comes to appreciate your presence there.",
                "Make the first move. Cancers tend to be shy, so gather up your courage and approach him first. The key is to present yourself in a non-aggressive way. Introduce yourself and cement your existence in his mind, but never push or pry your way inside his personal bubble, especially if he seems uncomfortable.\n\n\nYou'll need to be assertive, but indirectly so. Persistence is important here. Show him that you're genuinely interested in him by continually making the effort to approach him. A Cancer guy can be a little insecure at times, but once you calm those insecurities and demonstrate that your interest is real and lasting, he can feel comfortable enough to develop his own attraction and affection for you in return.",
                "Never confess your feelings directly. Dealing with a Cancer man can be incredibly complex and may test your patience. As someone who likes to assume the traditional male role in a relationship, he will probably want to confess his feelings first and may find you less attractive if you jump first. On the other hand, you have to make your feelings so obviously clear to him that he has very little reason to doubt your attraction to him.",
                "Listen. Cancer men are usually attracted to women who will share their feelings, but you'll be even more attractive if you demonstrate a willingness to really listen to everything he says. He needs to open up at his own pace and may do so slowly, but if you want to become an attractive person in his eyes, you'll need to be a trustworthy presence every step of the way.\n\n\nOccasionally, you should make it a point to demonstrate that you've been actively listening to him. Remember his birthday or any other special days he mentions to you. If he tells you about something he has going on at work in a few days, ask him how it went after the event passes.",
                "Avoid arousing his jealousy. You might be tempted to prod his affections along by flirting with other guys, but doing so can damage or kill any budding attraction he already has for you. Cancer men need to feel that they can completely trust their partners. If you give him even the slightest reason to doubt this early on, he may write you off as a potential mate.",
                "Prepare yourself for his possessiveness. Once a Cancer starts feeling attracted to you, he will probably become notably more possessive. If you want to nurture his growing attraction, you'll need to find ways of coping with his perceived invasion into your personal space. If you push him away, he will probably stay away for good.\n\n\nOf course, you should always mind your own needs when pursuing a potential relationship, even when doing so can chase away the guy you've set your sights on. If his possessiveness becomes dangerous or otherwise unnerving, walk away and don't look back. Even if his possessiveness seems innocent and harmless, though, you should still take a step back if it makes you feel uncomfortable or unhappy.",
                "Prepare yourself for a long relationship.[5] If you're hoping to attract a Cancer man for a one-night stand, you should probably set your sights elsewhere. His aversion to wild, quick-paced actions and his dedication to family make the Cancer guy a poor candidate for a fling. If you want to attract him in the hopes of starting a long-term relationship, though, you'll probably have much greater success."

        "How to Show Your Personality in an Interview": {
            "intro": "Showing your personality can help you to connect with your interviewer and allows them to see the real you. It also gives them the opportunity to judge if you will fit into their culture, which is beneficial for both of you. However, your nerves can sometimes make it difficult to show your real personality in an interview. Following the steps below can help you to get past your nerves and show your personality in an interview.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand the importance of a first impression. Within the first 5 minutes of your interview, the interviewer will form an impression of you. This first impression tends to stick and can be extremely difficult to change, especially in the very short time you have with the interviewer.\n\n\nFor example, if you come to an interview for a sales representative position but act all shy and timid, the interviewer will have the first impression that you are not as outgoing as you say you are.\nAt that point, no matter how much you give examples or try to explain your ability to do the job, the interviewer will still see you as shy and timid. Therefore, you want to try your best to be yourself and show off your good qualities that will help you fit in with the company and present yourself as the best person for the job.",
                "Practice interviewing and be prepared to answer questions about yourself. If you practice interviewing and prepare answers to questions the interviewer might ask, you will feel more relaxed during the real thing. This is due to the fact that you will be able to easily answer questions without too much thought.",
                "Arrive early so you have time to unwind and gather your thoughts. Just being able to sit down for a few moments prior to your interview will allow your mind to relax and put yourself into “interview mode”.",
                "Try to relax. Being able to relax during an interview is the most important step towards being yourself. Being relaxed during an interview means not letting your nerves get the best of you, which can prevent you from portraying yourself in the best way possible.\n\n\nSkilled interviewers will try to relax candidates by starting off with a little “chit chat” before getting into the main part of the interview. This is great for both of you because it allows you to gain rapport and speak more freely in the main part of the interview.\nHowever, building rapport prior to the start of the interview and feeling comfortable with the interviewer is not guaranteed.",
                "Be confident and take your time answering questions. Be confident and think positively. If you start thinking negatively, you will become more nervous. You have gotten this far, so now it is your chance to show them you are the right person for the job.\n\n\nRemember to breathe and take your time with answering questions. Long deep breaths will help you maintain a calmer sate and help you think clearly when answering questions.",
                "Remember to smile. Personality can be revealed through your smile. For example, if you come into the interview with a great, big smile you may be seen as a very happy, fun-loving person, which may be your true personality.\n\n\nIf, however, you are a very serious stern individual, showing your naturally reserved smile (and not a fake, cheesy grin) will portray your seriousness .\nWhichever the case may be, starting your interview off with a genuine (not forced) smile will help you build rapport, feel more relaxed, display your personality and possibly show off your confidence.",
                "Be yourself but remain professional. You may be silly, eccentric or have a strange sense of humor. Sometimes, it's okay to reveal this in an interview. However, you must remember to remain professional and sometimes that means toning it down.\n\n\nDon’t forget why you are really in the interview! Remember the point is not to “be on stage” but to showcase your strengths and personality that will prove you are the right person for the job.\nThe best advise here is to think before you say or do something that may be a little over the top for an interview. You do not want the interviewer to end the interview thinking “wow what just happened in there?” You want them to think “this person can do the job and will fit in just fine”.",
                "Answer interview questions by giving relevant examples that show your personality and showcase your unique characteristics. The best way to answer interview questions is by also providing examples to back up your claims to be able to do the job. To show your personality, you can choose examples that will explain how your personality contributes to your actions and helps you succeed.\n\n\nFor example, tell your interviewer about the time when you ran a contest for your team to reduce the amount of errors in their reports by rewarding the person with the least amount of errors after 2 weeks with a free lunch. This can show the interviewer that you have a unique personality with the ability to motivate your team in a fun way.",
                "Avoid acting. Showing your true personality is not acting, it comes out naturally and should remain as such. If you are trying too hard, you will be seen as a phony and it will be obvious that you are acting like someone you are not. This will also become exhausting for you!\n\n\nFor example, going into an interview extremely energetic, loud and upbeat may come off as annoying, because it will not be seen as genuine. You will then be so tired by mid-interview that you may not be able to focus.\nRemember you do not want to act like the person you think the company wants to hire, but who you really are."

        "How to Rosin a Bow": {
            "intro": "A bow without rosin will produce virtually no sound when it’s drawn across the strings of an instrument. But when rosin is added to your bow, it’s able to “catch” the strings and produce vibrations, which result in the music you hear. If you’re starting with new rosin, you’ll need to rough up the surface. Then you can make your first application to a new bow or regularly apply it to an old one.",
            "steps": [
                "Buy light rosin for smaller instruments. There are different types of rosin, but the two most common are light rosin and dark rosin. Light rosin is harder, and not quite so sticky as dark rosin. It's sometimes called amber or summer rosin (for the time of year it's tapped), and it's appropriate for the higher strings, like violins and violas.[1]",
                "Choose dark rosin for a fuller sound for larger instruments. Dark rosins, or winter rosins, tend to be very sticky. The stickier the rosin is, the fuller the sound will be. Select a dark rosin if you play a low-stringed, large instrument like the cello, for which a fuller sound is preferred.[2]",
                "Select boxed rosin for a durable, low-priced option. Boxed rosin, as its name suggests, comes in a box, which makes it less prone to cracking and breaking. It's typically only available as a light or summer rosin and is usually a lower quality than cake rosin. But its low price tag makes it a good option for beginners.[3]",
                "Opt for cake rosin for a higher-quality product. While cake rosin tends to be more expensive than boxed rosin, you're getting a purer, more high-quality rosin. It comes in a variety of colors, from amber to black, so you can select the best kind for your instrument.[4]",
                "Rub new rosin with fine-grit sandpaper to increase stickiness. New rosin needs to be roughened in order for it to stick to your bow. Take a piece of sandpaper, around 220-grit, and rub it all over the top of the rosin block. Stop when you see the rosin producing dust.[5]\n\nYou can also use a knife to score it and cut a crosshatch pattern into the top.",
                "Tighten the bow. Twist the screw at the end of the bow and tighten it until it appears straight and parallel with the hairs. Then slacken it just a little until you see the curve reappear in the wood. This is the best position for the bow to be in while you play.[6]\n\nDon't touch the hairs or bounce them on your arm, as this will make them greasy and harder to play.",
                "Hold the rosin in your left hand and the bow in your right hand. It doesn't matter if you are right- or left-handed, as you always hold the bow in your right hand while playing. Cup the rosin block in your left hand, being sure to keep your fingers off the side you’ll be stroking the bow against.",
                "Stroke the bow all the way across the rosin. Run the bow along the rosin from the tip down to the frog (the part you hold with your hand), and then stroke it back again. Grasp the bow gently and press down just hard enough that the bow hairs produce some dust, but not so hard that you’re clenching the bow.[7]",
                "Repeat for 20 full strokes. Stroke the bow back and forth across the rosin 20 times. Each time you finish a complete stroke (down and back), move the bow hairs over slightly to a new spot so that you don’t wear a line straight down the middle of the rosin.[8]\n\nIf your rosin block is circular, rotate the circle slightly in between each stroke.",
                "Play the instrument and listen for a full sound. After twenty strokes, draw your bow along the strings of your instrument. Listen for a full, uninterrupted tone. If the sound is uneven or you feel the bow slide around on the strings, you’ll need more rosin.[9]",
                "Stroke the rosin 20 more times. If the first 20 strokes didn’t produce the sound you want, repeat the process of stroking the bow over the rosin again. Add 20 more strokes, and then play the instrument to check the sound again.[10]\n\nIf you’re still unsatisfied, continue adding twenty strokes at a time and then checking the sound.",
                "Apply rosin once for every three to four hours you play. If you’re playing about an hour a day, you should apply rosin to your bow hairs every three to four days. If you play significantly more than that, you may need to apply rosin daily before playing. For less frequent practicing, apply it less often.[11]",
                "Stroke the bow on the rosin about five times. Once the bow has been rosined once, you won’t need to apply as much during each subsequent application. Stroke the bow back and forth over the rosin about five times before you begin practicing.[12]",
                "Wipe the bow hairs with a lint-free cloth after playing. Rosin dust can accumulate on the bow after a while. Keep a lint-free cloth in your instrument case along with your rosin. At the end of each playing session, wipe the bow hairs from frog to tip once or twice to remove excess rosin dust.[13]",
                "Wipe rosin dust off the violin and bow stick. Regularly check your instrument and bow stick for any rosin dust. Wipe if off with a lint-free cloth as soon as possible. Allowing the rosin to build up on your instrument can damage the finish, and you may need to pay for costly refinishing.[14]"

Actually, asking questions is a great indicator of intelligence and a desire to learn.[1]\n\nIf you’re going to ask questions, you need to pay attention. For example, if you ask, “When is that assignment due?” and your teacher has already said the due date once, they will think you’re not listening.\nBe mindful not to ask so many questions that you derail the class and prevent the teacher from finishing the lesson.",
                "Complete all assignments on time. This one can be difficult if you have a lot of work, or if you tend to procrastinate. However, turning in assignments on time shows your teacher that you are prioritizing their class. Paying attention can also help you get good grades and many of your teachers will like you.[2]\n\nTeachers have busy lives and need time off, just like you. They may have planned to grade all of your class’ papers on Wednesday night. If you turn your paper in on Friday, they will likely be frustrated that they now have to grade your paper over the weekend.\nIf you know that you won’t be able to meet a deadline, talk to your teacher about it in advance. They may be able to grant you an extension.",
                "Make extra efforts in your work. It’s always good to do more than the bare minimum for an assignment. Extra efforts can include binding your paper in a nice way to make it more presentable, or doing extra research for an assignment.[3]\n\nIf a teacher asks for a paper to be a certain length, you can aim to write something a little bit longer than requested, but not much. This shows that you weren’t just stretching to meet the minimum.\nIf you make your paper too long, your teacher may think you’re sucking up or they may not like having to do that much extra reading.",
                "Ask for extra help if you need it. Asking for help shows your teacher that you want to succeed. Many teachers look for this quality in a student, because if you want to succeed you’re likely to take their help and suggestions seriously.[4]\n\nDon’t be afraid to approach your teacher during their free period or at the end of the day.\nYou may need help understanding the subject matter, or knowing how to complete the assignment. You should feel comfortable asking for whatever kind of help you need.\nAsking help from your parents is a good option, too. They can explain things in another perspective, and will most likely love to help you.",
                "Respect the teacher’s authority on a subject. Teachers have been through a lot of education and they have chosen a profession where they get to share their knowledge. You may know a lot about a subject as well, but teachers will appreciate if you treat them as the experts they are.[5]\n\nOccasionally it’s okay to correct your teacher. After all, everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\nMany teachers are wary of “know-it-all” students. Not only will acting like a know-it-all jeopardize your relationship with your teacher, it may also annoy your classmates. No one wants a smarty-pants as a friend.",
                "Let your teacher know who you are. Teachers can tell when a student isn’t being themselves. For example, if you’re a science fiction geek or a competitive athlete, those are important things that help define who you are. Never try to hide those things just to look like the perfect student.[6]\n\nIf you’re naturally a goofball or “class clown,” you may need to control yourself some to avoid disrupting class. However, most teachers have a sense of humor and will appreciate some silliness or joking in class.\nDon’t let your personality distract from class. For example, if you’re a social butterfly, you can wait until the bell rings to hand out the invitations to your party. You don’t need to do that during class.",
                "Embrace things you and your teacher may have in common. This may be the only proven thing that determines which students will become a teacher’s favorite. You may remind them of themselves at your age, or of someone they are close to. You may share interests or hobbies. If your teacher senses that you have something in common, they are likely to favor you.[7]\n\nSometimes, your teacher might just feel that you have similar personalities. For example, they might be able to identify with the fact that you’re shy, or that you get easily frustrated.\nIf you know your teacher shares an interest with you, you can connect with them over that. For example, if your teacher loves art, you could bring in a review of the latest exhibition at the local art museum to share with them.",
                "Be honest about your struggles. This can be difficult, especially if you’re shy. However, most teachers will appreciate a student who can be honest and confide in them. If you’re struggling with school work, or having trouble at home, letting your teacher know will likely endear you to them.[8]\n\nIf you’re having trouble outside of school (such as at home or at a job) let your teacher know. They might be able to extend deadlines for you or help you talk to a guidance counselor.\nBe careful not to come across as whiny or complaining. Teachers can tell the difference between a student who is truly struggling and one who simply doesn’t want to do the work.",
                "Remember that your teacher has a life outside of school, too. Teachers like to relax and have fun on the weekends just like you. Sometimes it might seem like they only exist to make your life miserable; but remember that they probably became a teacher because they like working with young people and love helping them learn.[9]\n\nShow interest in your teacher’s life. You can ask them how their weekend was, or what they have planned for summer vacation.\nDon't talk behind a teacher's back. They will probably find out after a while. Gossiping about the teacher will get you in bigger trouble.",
                "Smile and act friendly. Imagine if you came into work and everyone around you had a bad attitude. That’s what it can feel like for a teacher with a room full of grumpy students. Acting friendly and being happy to see your teacher will brighten their day and help them feel appreciated by you.[10]\n\nA teacher can tell when a student is genuinely being friendly or just sucking up. Don’t go too far and start acting fake.\nJust a simple \"Good morning!\" or \"Good evening!\" is all it takes to brighten a teacher's day.",
                "Accept the grades you’re given. You and your teacher might disagree about the grade you deserve in a class. However, your teacher has probably given your grade a lot of consideration. If you contest the grade your teacher gave you, they’ll think you care more about your grades than about the learning process. They also may feel that you’re disrespecting their authority.[11]\n\nIf you’re concerned that your grades are not what you wanted them to be, talk to your teacher about how you can get better grades next time.",
                "Be helpful to your teacher. Teaching can be difficult, and teachers get tired, just like you. If you notice that your teacher could use a hand, offer to help out. They’ll definitely notice and appreciate your helpful attitude.[12]\n\nYou can help your teacher by erasing the board, passing out papers, or bringing something to the office for them.\nIf you arrive to class early, you can always ask if there’s anything you can do to help them prepare for class.",
                "Talk to your teacher if you feel unfairly treated. If your teacher has not been treating you fairly, it’s okay to approach them about it. Ask them if you can speak with them during lunch or after school. Even if right now it seems that your teacher hates you, being able to have a mature conversation with them will likely turn the tide. Your teacher will see that you're invested in the relationship and in the class.[13]\n\nAct calm and respectful when you speak to your teacher. You can say, “I’m not sure if you’ve noticed this, but I feel that I’m not being treated fairly in class.”\nIt’s great to be able to give specific examples so your teacher can see what you’re talking about. You can say, “When Maria made a joke and the class laughed, you laughed too. But when I made a joke and everyone laughed you sent me to the office. I don’t feel like that’s fair.”"

            "intro": "Orange Ice Cube Lollies",
            "steps": [
                "Combine orange juice and simple syrup in a bowl. Stir or whisk to make sure the syrup is evenly mixed with the orange juice. Consider using fresh-squeezed juice that you can find a many grocery stores, which will be less watered down and have more flavor.\n\n\nFor a little extra kick, add 2 tbsp lemon juice to the mixture.[1]\n\nFeel free to experiment with any kind of fruit juice you like! Grape, pineapple, watermelon, limeaide--it's up to you!\nYou may even want to try adding some veggie juice--carrot juice is naturally very sweet and can add a nice complexity to your lollies.[2]",
                "Pour mixture into a clean, empty ice cube tray. Fill each cell almost to the top, but don't overflow or your lollies will stick together.",
                "Cover the tray with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Make sure the wrap is tight across the top of the tray.[3]\n\nTape plastic wrap to the sides of the ice tray to keep it tight and in place.",
                "Stick toothpicks through the plastic wrap or aluminum foil and into each cube. This will be the handle for your ice lolly--make sure it is standing up straight and is far enough into the tray for the juice to freeze around it.[4]",
                "Place the tray in the freezer. To be certain your lollies are totally frozen, leave them in overnight.[5] If you just can't wait, check after 2-3 hours.\n\n\nYou can gently wiggle one toothpick to feel if the juice has frozen completely.",
                "Remove the tray the freezer once juice has completely frozen and remove the cover. Your mini-ice lollies should be ready to eat.",
                "Bend and twist the ice cube tray to loosen your mini ice lollies, then remove with the toothpick handle. Be gentle while working the ice cube tray--you don't want to snap it!\n\n\nIf you have trouble getting the cubes out, try dipping the bottom of the tray in warm water.",
                "Hull the strawberries. It's best to let an adult do this, since it requires you to use a knife. Use a small, sharp knife (a pairing knife works best), holding it against the thumb of your dominant hand so about 1/2 inch of the tip sticks out beyond your thumb. Hold the strawberry in your opposite hand.[6]\n\nInsert the tip of the knife into the top of the strawberry--under the leaves, where the red turns white--at a 45 degree angle.[7]\n\nTurn the strawberry and the knife in opposite directions.[8]\n\nCut until your knife reaches the starting point and you can easily remove the core from the strawberry.[9]",
                "Puree the hulled strawberries in a blender.[10] The finished puree should be smooth and thick. Have an adult help you with this part so you don't cut yourself on the blades or make a mess!\n\n\nYou can substitute frozen strawberries if you don't have any fresh strawberries. Frozen fruits are frozen when ripe, so they should still taste great.\nYou can also leave chunks of strawberries to add texture to your lollies. Use the \"pulse\" setting on the blender so you don't puree all the fruit. You can also add slices of strawberry to the puree later.[11]",
                "Place the strainer over a bowl and pour the puree through the strainer. You want to catch all the little strawberry seeds in the strainer, so make sure the strainer is fine enough to only let the juice pass through.[12]\n\nIt's okay if you don't strain out your seeds. Your lollies won't be quite as smooth and the seeds may get stuck in your teeth, but they will still be delicious.\nIf you decided to leave some fruit chunks in your puree, skip this step so you don't lose those big pieces of fruit.",
                "Add the simple syrup, heavy cream, and lemon juice to the bowl of strawberry juice and whisk the mixture until combined. The mix should be the same color and consistency throughout. If there are white streaks from the heavy cream, you may want to mix a little more thoroughly.\n\n\nIf you don't like strawberry, feel free to experiment with other fruit flavors! Try watermelon, mango, blueberry--whatever you like best! Look for fruit that is ripe and in season for the best, sweetest flavors.[13]\n\nTry coconut milk instead of heavy cream for a refreshing tropical flavor.\nYou can also improvise with your sweetener. Instead of simple syrup, try agave nectar, honey, or maple syrup.",
                "Pour the mixture into the ice pop molds.[14] Fill almost to the top, but be careful not to overflow the molds or your lollies will stick together when frozen. A little extra space also gives the liquid room to expand.\n\n\nIf you don't have molds, you can easily make your own. Just pour the mixture into a paper or plastic cup instead.\nDo not try to make your own mold using a glass. Liquid expands as it freezes, and it may break the glass. This will ruin your pop and make a dangerous mess in your freezer.",
                "Top the mold with the lid. Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. If your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Then insert a popsicle stick through the wrap.\n\n\nDon't move the popsicle stick around too much--the smaller the hole in the aluminum, the straighter your handle will stand.\nYou can also use plastic knives as handles if you don't have popsicle sticks--just be careful not to lick the rough part when you're eating!",
                "Place molds in the freezer. Leaving them overnight will ensure the pops are completely frozen, but they may be ready in as little as four hours.[15]",
                "Remove molds from the freezer once the juice is completely frozen through. If you try to wiggle the handle, it should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom of the mold to help release ice lollies in one piece.[16]\n\nIf you used a paper cup, you can try to just peel the paper off the lolly.",
                "Ask an adult to help you prepare the fruit, since you'll need to peel and slice the fruit. All the fruit should be ripe (or even overripe)--ripened fruit is sweeter, so you won't need to add any extra sugar.[17]",
                "Hull the strawberries. Use a small, sharp knife to cut the core out of the strawberries.\n\n\nInsert the tip of the knife into the top of the strawberry, right where it turns white.\nCut out the white center of the strawberry. In doing so, you will remove the leaves as well.",
                "Puree the hulled strawberries in a blender.[18] If you don't have fresh strawberries, it's ok to use frozen. The taste might not be as intense or fresh, but it will still be delicious!\n\n\nClean the blender after use, since you will be using it again for the peaches and the kiwi.",
                "Place the strainer or sieve over a bowl and pour the puree through the strainer. This should catch all the strawberry seeds so they don't end up in your frozen lolly.[19]",
                "Add 1 1/2 tbsp simple syrup to the strawberry puree and mix.\n\n\nYou can substitute another sweetener for simple syrup. Try honey, agave nectar, or maple syrup.\nSample a little of the puree to make sure it's sweet enough. If not, add a little bit more sweetener, to taste.",
                "Pour the sweetened strawberry mixture into your ice pop molds, filling only 1/3 of the way to the top.\n\n\nIf you don't have an ice pop mold, you can substitute a paper or disposable plastic cup.\nDon't try to substitute a glass for the pop mold--as the juice freezes, it expands, and it may break the glass. This will ruin your pop and make a dangerous, sharp mess in your freezer.",
                "Put the mold in the freezer until the strawberry mixture is frozen. This should take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.[20] Cover the mold with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. If the molds came with covers that double as a handle/popsicle stick, wait to use these. If the first layer of your ice lolly freezes around the stick, you won't be able to add the next two layers.",
                "Peel the skin off the peaches with a peeler or knife. If you don't have fresh peaches, you can use canned peaches that are already peeled, stoned, and sliced. Just drain the water from the can.",
                "Remove the pits from the peaches and slice into small pieces. Your blender won't have to work as hard to puree the fruit if it's cut into little slices. Using a paring knife, cut all the way through one side of the peach, until your knife hits the pit.[21]\n\nRun the knife all the way around the peach, keeping the blade against the pit, cutting the peach in half.[22]\n\nHold the peach in your hands and twist each half in opposite directions until the come apart. The pit should still be stuck in one half of the peach.[23]\n\nRemove the pit with your fingers or the tip of the knife.[24]",
                "Puree the peaches in the blender and add 1 1/4 tbsp simple syrup.[25] Taste the puree to make sure you like the flavor. If it's not sweet enough, and a little simple syrup until it's to your liking.\n\n\nClean the blender so it will be ready for the kiwi puree.",
                "Pour the sweetened peach puree into the ice lolly mold. Only fill the mold another 1/3 of the way to the top.[26] Cover the mold with tinfoil or plastic wrap.\n\n\nMake sure the strawberry puree is completely frozen before you add the peach puree, or they will mix together. This will probably taste good, but the effect of having 3 individual sections of flavors will be ruined.",
                "Put the mold in the freezer until the peach mixture is frozen. This should take another 1 1/2 to 2 hours.[27]",
                "Peel the kiwi with a knife or peeler and slice into smaller pieces. Make sure you remove all the fuzzy skin and discard the top and bottom tips.[28]",
                "Puree the sliced kiwi and 1 1/4 tbsp simple syrup in the blender.[29] Blend out all the chunks for a smooth and thick mixture. Again, you may want to taste the puree to make sure it's sweet enough.",
                "Pour the sweetened kiwi mixture into the ice lolly mold. Don't let the kiwi spill out of the top of the mold, or your lollies will all freeze together. Leave a little room at the top so you can insert the handle and give the puree a little room to expand as it freezes.",
                "Top the mold with the lid. Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. You may have to push it into the already frozen part of the lollie.\n\n\nIf your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil.\nInsert a popsicle stick through the aluminum foil. Make sure it is straight. It's okay if you have to push it into the frozen peach layer to make sure it's secure.",
                "Put the mold in the freezer for another 2 hours, or until the kiwi mixture is frozen.\n\n\nTest that the juice is completely frozen by wiggling the handle of one of the pops. It should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom mold to help release ice lollies in one piece--just don't loosen them from the handle![30]",
                "Your finished ice lollies should be equal layers of pink, yellow, and green--just like a traffic light! After you've enjoyed these frozen treats, consider experimenting with other flavors. Try to stick with fruits that are all in season at the same time for the most harmonious flavors.[31]\n\nSpring and summer fruits include blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries, grapes, melons, nectarines, plums, peaches, and pluots.[32]\n\nBlackberries, apples, kiwis, dates, kumquats, peaches, pomegranates, and raspberries are all in season during late summer and fall.[33]\n\nTry grapefruit, kumquats, limes, mandarins, and pomelos in the winter.[34]\n\nOranges are in season all year long.[35]"

        "How to Reduce Pain Caused by a New Piercing": {
            "intro": "True or False: You can swim in a pool with a new piercing, but not the open ocean. ",
            "steps": [
                "Ice the piercing. Simply icing the area in question can often soothe some pain associated with piercings. This can be helpful during the first few days, and can also reduce swelling. Apply something cold, like a bag of frozen peas, or an ice pack to the area during downtime throughout the day.[1]\n\nKeep in mind, you may want to place a clean, dry rag over the ice pack or cold object to prevent infection. This can also help prevent freezer burn.\nDo not leave the ice on for more than 20 minutes at a time.",
                "Try a chamomile tea compress. Many people advocate a chamomile compress as a way to help soothe and potentially prevent scarring. You will need a bag of chamomile tea.[2]\n\nBoil some water and immerse the tea bag in the water. After several minutes, remove the tea bag.\nLet the tea bag cool for a few minutes. Then, apply the tea bag to your piercing, in the area where you feel pain.",
                "Try cold food and drinks for lip piercings. If you got your lip pierced, eating and drinking something cool can help. Try ice cream, cold water, cold beverages, popsicles, frozen yogurt, and other cold items to ease the pain.[3]\n\nThere may be certain foods that irritate your skin. If anything you're eating seems to aggravate the piercing, try something else.",
                "Use over-the-counter painkillers. A simple over-the-counter painkiller can help get rid of the pain of a new piercing. Try something like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if the pain is getting bad. This can reduce pain and also take away some swelling.[4]\n\nMake sure to check that any chosen painkiller does not interact poorly with existing medications first.\nRead the label of any medications to make sure to take the painkillers at the correct dosage.",
                "Follow all care instructions. When you get a new piercing, you will go home with a set of instructions for care. It is important to follow these instructions carefully. Your piercing will hurt for longer if you don't encourage it to heal properly.[5]\n\nUsually, you will have to clean your piercing at least once a day. Some piercings may need to be cleaned more frequently. Before cleaning, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap.\nYour piercer should have given specific instructions for cleaning. Usually, you rinse the piercing in warm water and a saline solution and then clean off any crust using a cotton swab.\nCleaning is very important. It keeps the area free of bacteria that can cause an infection.",
                "Do not fiddle with new piercings. You may be tempted to touch or twist your new piercing. This will irritate the area, causing more pain. Also, touching your piercing with dirty hands greatly increases your risk of an infection.[6]",
                "Leave the piercing in place. Do not take the piercing out before the healing period has passed. When you get your piercing, your piercer will let you know how many weeks the piercing needs to stay in place. Until this time has passed, do not remove the piercing for any reasons. This will delay the healing process, and putting the piercing back in place may cause pain.[7]",
                "Do not use hydrogen peroxide. If you suspect your piercing is infected, talk to a doctor or return to your piercer. Do not attempt to fix the infection on your own with hydrogen peroxide. This kills healing cells and can cause crust to build up around your piercing.[8]",
                "Wash your hands before handling the piercing. If you handle the piercing for any reason, wash your hands. Use clean, warm water and antibacterial soap. Touching a piercing without clean hands is a major cause of infection.[9]\n\nTry to wash your hands for about 20 seconds.\nMake sure to get all areas of your hands clean. Pay attention to the backs of your hands, under your fingernails, and between your fingers.",
                "Use salt water soaks. Regular salt water soaks can promote healing and prevent infection. You may get salt water solution from your piercer. You can also mix a teaspoon of salt (about 5 milliliters) into 8 ounces (about .2 liters) of water and mix thoroughly.[10]\n\nSoak a q-tip or cotton swab in the salt water. Place it on the piercing for a few seconds and then discard.\nRepeat this process for 5 to 6 minutes.\nDo this twice a day for about a month or until your piercing is fully healed.",
                "Avoid swimming. Swimming after a piercing is a bad idea. Chlorine from pool water, and contaminants from open water, can irritate a piercing and cause infection. Refrain from swimming until your piercing is fully healed.[11]",
                "Make sure nothing touches in the pierced area. Keep foreign objects away from the pierced area while you wait for it to heal. Do not, for example, wear a hat if you have an eyebrow piercing. You should always be aware of your hair if it's longer. Keep long hair from touching the piercing. You may have to pull your hair back more often as the piercing heals.[12]\n\nAvoid sleeping on the side of your body where the piercing is. Bacteria from your pillow can cause an infection.[13]\n\nIf you have something like a navel piercing, talk to your piercer on how to best protect it. You may have to wear gauze over the piercing or loose-fitting clothing."

        "wikiHow to Clean Carpets": {
            "intro": "Carpets tend to attract dirt, stains and animal hair as well as mold and mildew. Properly caring for your carpet will prevent dust mites, fleas and carpet bugs from moving in. Read on for information on everyday carpet maintenance, odor removal and deep cleaning techniques.",
            "steps": [
                "Vacuum regularly. Invest in a good vacuum that sucks up dirt from deep within the carpet fibers, especially if you have a shaggy carpet or you live with cats and dogs. Vacuuming regularly keeps your carpet looking and smelling fresh.\n\n\nVacuum several times a week. If you have pets, you may need to vacuum every day.\nDon't rush the vacuuming process. Even high-powered vacuums need a moment to grab dust, dirt and fur from the base of the carpet fibers. Run the vacuum over the carpet more than once to ensure it is completely clean.",
                "Protect heavily-traveled areas of the carpet. If your carpeting reaches your front door, kitchen, or other areas of your home that tend to get a lot of traffic, consider protecting those areas with throw rugs or plastic carpet protector mats. That way you won't be struggling to clean up clots of dirt and bits of grass with the vacuum cleaner every day.\n\n\nPlastic carpet protector mats have the added bonus of allowing the carpet to be visible through the clear plastic. They are an inconspicuous way to protect your carpet from dirt.\nUse carpet runners in hallways, which tend to get a lot of foot traffic.",
                "Clean up spills right away. Letting spills soak into your carpet and dry makes it much harder to remove the residue. If you can get to a spill right after the accident, you'll save a lot of time later.\n\n\nUse a clean cloth or paper towels to absorb the spill, then pour baking powder over the area and let it sit for 15 minutes. When the spill is completely dry, vacuum it up.\nIf wine or another colorful liquid is spilled, add a little club soda before sprinkling on the baking soda.",
                "Know the right technique for removing older stains. Sometimes its impossible to get to a stain right away. If you're faced with an old wine or coffee stain, don't panic; many carpets are pre-treated with stain resistant chemicals, so stains aren't usually difficult to remove. Use a spray bottle full of vinegar to lightly spray the area, then wipe it with a cloth. For deeper stains, saturate the area with vinegar or carpet cleaner, sprinkle with baking soda, and vacuum the area once the baking soda has dried.\n\n\nDon't attempt to scrub stains away from carpets. Scrubbing damages the fibers and makes the area look worse.\nDon't douse the area with too much vinegar, water, or any other liquid. If it seeps too deeply into the carpet to dry, it could lead to mold growth.\nLighter carpets can be effectively cleaned by applying a mixture of lemon and salt. Do a spot treatment in a discreet area to make sure it doesn't stain your carpet a different color.",
                "Vacuum the carpet. Prepare your carpet for odor-removal treatment by thoroughly vacuuming it first. If your carpet is holding a lot of dirt, sweep it first with a broom to lift the fibers and loosen the dirt, then vacuum.",
                "Make an odor removal mixture. Carpets can be effectively cleaning using products you probably already have in your cabinets. Mix the following ingredients in a bowl you don't plan to use again for cooking:\n\n\n1 cup borax (available at hardware stores)\n2 cups cornmeal\n1/2 cup baking soda",
                "Treat stained or smelly areas with vinegar and water. Fill a spray bottle with a solution of half vinegar, half water and spray the areas that need the most help. Be sure not to completely douse them with liquid, since you don't want unevaporated moisture to lead to mold growth.",
                "Sprinkle the cornmeal mixture over the carpet. Spread it evenly around the carpet, focusing on the areas that tend to get dirtiest or smell the most. Leave the room and let the mixture sit on the carpet for an hour.\n\n\nKeep children and pets out of the room while the mixture sits on the carpet.\nDon't use more powder than your vacuum can handle. A light sprinkling should be enough to remove odors and light stains.",
                "Vacuum the carpet again. Run the vacuum several times over the carpet to clean up the cornmeal mixture. When you're finished, discard the vacuum bag.",
                "Buy or rent a carpet-cleaning machine. The deepest stains and toughest odors can be removed with a carpet-cleaning machine, which uses hot water and a chemical cleaner to wash the fibers of your carpet.\n\n\nCarpet-cleaning machines can be rented from home and garden stores, Walmart, and specialty vacuuming or carpet stores.\nCarpet-cleaning machine rentals come with cleaning solution and stain removal treatment. It's important to know what kind of carpet you have before renting a machine, so you can ensure that you use the proper cleaning solution for your carpet.\nYou may also wish to hire a professional to come to your house and use the cleaner to clean your carpet for you.",
                "Vacuum the carpet. Make sure it is completely free of all loose dust and dirt before you start the deep cleaning treatment. Sweep the dirtiest parts of the carpet to kick up dirt before vacuuming.",
                "Pre-treat stained areas. Most carpet-cleaning rentals come with a solution that is meant to be applied to stained areas before the deep cleaning is conducted. If you don't have a stain remover solution, spray stained areas with vinegar instead.",
                "Add water and cleaning solution to the machine. Follow the directions that came with your machine to add the appropriate amounts of hot water and carpet cleaner.\n\n\nIn some cases the water and solution are each held in their own tank; as instructed, remove the tanks and fill them with water or cleaner.\nMake sure the tanks are properly fitted on the machine before proceeding.",
                "Plug in the machine and clean your carpet. Run the machine slowly over the carpet, making sure to cover every inch. You may overlap areas that have already been cleaned to be sure you don't miss a spot. On some machine models you will see dirty water splash into a receptacle when the machine is working properly.\n\n\nIf the machine runs out of water or cleaning solution, turn it off and unplug it. Discard the dirty solution, rinse the tanks, and fill them with clean hot water and cleaning solution.\nDirty solution may be poured into the toilet.",
                "Allow your carpet to dry. Within a few hours it should look and smell good as new."

Perfect for a summery day, tepache is refreshing while still being complex. The word \"tepache\" comes from the Nahuatl language, formerly spoken by the Aztecs, and still spoken in some regions of Mexico. It means \"drink made from corn,\" which was originally used to ferment the drink. If you want to make tepache and don't know how, read this recipe to make use of one whole pineapple and a little bit of beer.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash the outside of the pineapple thoroughly with a clean brush.",
                "Remove both the base and stem of the pineapple with a knife.",

                "In a large jug or pot, add the water, piloncillo, cinnamon, and cloves.",
                "Bring the pot to boil over high heat.",

                "Cover pot and set aside for 2 days in a warm part of your kitchen. The tepache should begin to ferment after the first day.",
                "After 2 days, add the can of light beer and let stand for up to 12 hours.",
                "Strain the tepache through a cheesecloth and refrigerate until cold. In order to get a smooth texture, you may need to strain the tepache through a second cheesecloth before refrigerating.",
                "Add oranges and tamarind alongside the other ingredients. Cut up one or two oranges (with peel), as you would the pineapple. Add a couple crushed tamarind pods to the pot before boiling, and the oranges to the pot along with the pineapple chunks.",
                "Add apples and pears to the other ingredients. Cut up one apple and one pear (both with peel) and add them to the tepache when introducing the pineapple. This variation makes for a sweeter, fruitier tepache.",
                "Add tobacco leaves to the fermentation process for an added kick.[3] Some tepache makers have begun adding loose-leaf tobacco to their brew in order to increase its smokiness and potency.",

            "intro": "Stress is an unavoidable part of life brought on by both good and bad events. Although stress can't be avoided you can manage your response to it. By taking a day to yourself and making it as relaxing as you can the harmful effects of stress can be reduced, improving your health and sense of well being.",
            "steps": [
                "Take your time. You may have a rough idea of what you want to do with your relaxing day. Since it is your day to relax you will want to plan things according to your own schedule without worrying about the usual pressure to get things done. Unwind and do things at your own pace during your relaxing day.[1]\n\nYou may find not having anything planned at all is the most relaxing way to spend your day.\nConsider sleeping in, waking up whenever you feel like it.\nRelax and enjoy whatever activities you end up doing, taking your time and fully enjoying it.",
                "Do what you want. It's your relaxing day. Plan on doing whatever you find most enjoyable and restful. Everyone will have different ideas on what might be relaxing so take a moment to plan a few things that you know you would find calming.[2]\n\nYou might want to lay on the couch and watch some of your favorite movies or shows.\nListening to your favorite music while you cook a delicious meal might be relaxing.\nSpending the day reading a new and exciting book can be a great way to relax and enjoy your day.",
                "Catch up on lost sleep. Sleep is an extremely important aspect of maintaining health and often times it is neglected. Busy schedules and feelings of stress can cause you to lose sleep, resulting in feeling tired during the day. Consider going to bed early on your relaxing day and getting a good night's rest, recovering lost hours of sleep and waking up feeling invigorated.[3][4]\n\nThe amount of sleep required will change over a person's life, largely based on how old they are.\nMost adults need around seven to eight hours of sleep per night to feel rested.\nLack of sleep can affect health negatively, causing you to feel tired more often and even lowering your immune system's response.",
                "Focus on what you are grateful for. It can be easy to focus on things that aren't going our way. This will cause feelings of stress and worry to increase. Instead, use your relaxing day to focus on positive aspects or accomplishments in your life. Take some time to make a list of the things you are most grateful for in your life to diminish the stress of negative thinking.[5]\n\nConsider taking up a journal. Everyday you can write about the things that went well or that you are happy for.\nThink about your friends and family, writing down your favorite moments you've shared with them.\nTry to write at least three things that made your happy during your day.",
                "Go for a walk. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress and have a positive effect on the mood. Getting in some light exercise by going for a walk can be a good way to get rid of stress in your body and make your day a relaxing one.\n\n\nTry walking to somewhere new to you, exploring and enjoying your neighborhood.\nWalk around your favorite local park.\nTake your time and enjoy the sights and sounds as you go for your stroll.",
                "Do some stretching. Stress can build up tension and tightness in the body. You can use your relaxing day to get in some stretching practice. Stretching the body, joints, and muscles can restore mobility and reduce built up tension in the body, bringing about a sense of relaxation.\n\n\nA simple stretch is a toe touch. Stand up straight and then bend down, trying to bring your hands to your feet. You should feel this stretch most strongly in your hamstrings.\nYou can stretch the front of your legs by standing up straight, grabbing your ankle and pulling it up towards your back.\nNever bounce the body part you are stretching as this could cause injury. Gently stretch and hold the stretch for a few seconds instead of any jerky or bouncy motions.\nWhen you stretch an area imagine the tension leaving it and that it is becoming more and more relaxed.\nInhale slowly and deeply as you stretch. Exhale fully and gently as you relax the stretch.\nClosing your eyes can help you focus on the stretch.",
                "Use the progressive muscle relaxation method. Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple and easy method to reduce tension in the body. It allows you to fully feel all areas of the body by deliberately increasing tension and then fully relaxing them. Using this method will allow you to loosen up your muscles on your relaxing day.[6]\n\nStart by focusing on your feet. Tense your feet as much as you can for about five seconds and then relax them for thirty.\nDo the same technique on each body part as you work your way up to your head and neck.\nIf any area still feels tight you can repeat the technique to relax it further.",
                "Take a hot bath. Taking a hot bath is a great way to relax the body, relieving tension and soreness in your muscles. Think about adding some of your favorite scents, bath salts or decorating the room with candles or other relaxing items. Once you've prepared your bath all that's left to do is soak and enjoy.",
                "Give yourself a massage. You can go out to a spa and get a massage which can be an excellent way to relax. However, if you want to stay home and enjoy a day to yourself you can give yourself a massage, working out tension in your muscles and bringing about a sense of relaxation.[7]\n\nMassage your scalp by gently rubbing the sides of your head near the temples.\nMassage your face by using your fingertips, rubbing your jawline, hairline, cheekbones, and earlobes.\nMassage your arm by laying it flat on your leg and using your opposite palm to rub down your forearm towards your wrist.\nMassage your thighs using your palm or elbows, applying gentle pressure as you move down towards your knee.",
                "Pick a type of meditation that appeals to you. The term meditation describes the general practice of working with your mental life to reduce stress there. Although the term itself is general there are specific forms of meditation that you can engage in. Examine the following overview to get you started in finding a form of meditation that feels right for you:[8]\n\nYou can create a safe and wonderful space in your mind and explore it, imagining it with all your senses.\nRepeating a phrase or word can help keep your focus on the phrase instead of bothersome or distracting thoughts.\nTry simply watching your thoughts and feelings, allowing them to pass by without judgment or attachment.",
                "Get comfortable. The first step in meditating will be to manage your environment, making it calm and distraction free. The focus during meditation will be on your inner mental life and outside distractions can cause you to lose that focus. Make your space stress free and get your body relaxed and comfortable before you start to meditate.[9]\n\nYou might find that laying down or comfortably sitting are good postures for meditation.\nMake sure your clothes are lose fitting and comfortable.\nTurn your phone off before getting started.",
                "Try mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation allows the stream of noise that your mind produces to pass by you, allowing you to relax and simply observe. You will need to quiet your mind and focus, relaxing into the meditation and allowing any distracting thoughts or stress to pass you by without attachment to them.[10][11]\n\nSit down and close your eyes.\nTake note of your mental activity. Chances are you will be talking or thinking to yourself.\nCalmly watch your inner thoughts, images, or feelings that your mind produces.\nYour goal is to simply observe these thoughts without attaching or engaging with them.\nIf you find yourself engaging with your thoughts, gently return your focus and resume passively watching them.\nYou will find that over time you mental chatter will fade and grow quiet, affording you a calm and relaxed mind.",
                "Consider visualization techniques. Your imagination has a great amount of power over how you feel mentally. The human mind doesn't make distinctions between your imagined experiences and reality. Take advantage of this fact and create a wonderful and relaxing experience using your imagination.[12]\n\nGet comfortable and close your eyes.\nThink of a place that you find calming and safe, somewhere that you love being.\nTry to see this space in great detail. Think of what the colors look like here or what items or people appear as. Try to see this calming space as clearly as you can.\nImagine the sounds of this space. What noises can you hear? Take your time and really imagine that you can hear the sounds of your visualized space.\nAsk yourself what smells are in your calm and relaxing space. Inhale and imagine the scents as your breathe them in.\nPay attention to how your space feels. Ask yourself what the temperature is, what some items feel like to touch, or what a breeze might feel like.\nTake your time and enjoy the space you have created, exploring and relaxing there for as long as you like.",
                "Slowly return to normal activity. After you have finished meditating you will want to slowly refocus your attention on the “outside” world again. Notice any feelings of inner calm or peace as you engage once again with the world, knowing that you can find these relaxed feelings again when you start to feel stress in the future."

        "How to Clean Brass": {
            "intro": "Brass is an alloy of zinc, copper, and sometimes other metals. Brass is a material that has been used by ancient civilizations and modern day people alike due to its durability, elegance, and malleability. However, brass can accumulate dirt and greasy oils, and may tarnish over time. If you're looking to brighten up your brass piece, there are various cleaning treatments that simply require common household products combined with careful application. You can also use commercials cleaners to spruce up your brass depending on the amount of tarnish covering the brass piece.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine if the piece you want to clean is actually brass. Hold a household magnet near the brass piece, and see if it is magnetically attracted to the brass.\n\n\nIf the magnet doesn’t magnetically cling to the object, it’s brass.\nIf the magnet does magnetically cling to the object, it’s likely that the “brass” piece is really a piece of iron or steel, covered with a brass coating.[1]",
                "Determine if the piece you want to clean should be cleaned. Some brass objects are not meant to be bright, and therefore, any efforts to clean the piece might actually diminish its worth. If you are unsure of what your next steps should be in cleaning a brass piece, talk to a brass expert and discuss your cleaning options.[2]\n\nSometimes patina (the turquoise coloring that forms on brass and copper) can add a unique look to a piece of brass, and should be left alone.\nPatina is used to evaluate many aspects of a piece of brass. For example, patina can be used to determine the age of a piece of brass, its current condition, and its potential value. Any removal or alteration of patina on a brass piece can significantly affect its worth.[3]",
                "Determine if the brass piece is lacquered. On modern brass pieces, an outer coating of lacquer serves as a layer of protection against oxidation. But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don’t have a lacquered coating.[4] You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating.[5]\n\nLacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish.\nIf you are still having trouble figuring out if your brass piece has a lacquered finish, remember that lacquered brass usually has more of a yellow shading.[6]",
                "Clean your lacquered brass piece. The first line of defense for keeping your brass pieces clean is to regularly dust them using a soft rag.[7] After dusting your lacquered brass, dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water. Wring out the cloth so it’s only slightly damp, and gently wipe the brass surface clean. Once you have cleaned the surface, use a wrung out cloth dipped in clean water to remove any remaining soap, and then dry the brass piece thoroughly.\n\n\nIf you are trying to remove tarnish that has accumulated underneath lacquered brass, you need to remove the layer of lacquer first.",
                "Remove the lacquer with hot water. Hot water softens the lacquer layering covering brass. Place the brass piece in a sink basin, and pour hot water over the brass.[8] The hot water will heat up the brass, making it expand. The lacquer will expand with the brass. However, when the brass starts to cool down, it will slightly shrink, but the lacquer won’t shrink with it. Once the brass is cool, the lacquer should be slightly separated from the brass surface, and can easily be peeled away.[9]\n\nYou could also try boiling your brass in water to remove the lacquer, depending on the size of the piece. All you need to do is immerse the brass piece in a non-aluminum pot with boiling water, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, carefully take the brass piece out of the water, let it cool, and peel off the lacquer.[10]",
                "Remove the lacquer with varnish remover. Place the brass piece on a table that is heavily layered with newspapers. The newspaper will help protect the workspace by absorbing any varnish remover drippings.[11] Consider using a paintbrush to thoroughly and evenly coat the brass piece with the varnish remover. Once you have applied the remover, let it sit for a minute or two, and then wipe away the varnish remover with a soft cloth. Be sure to consult the instructions found on the container of varnish remover.\n\n\nBe cautious and follow the manufacturer's cleaning guidelines, because varnish remover is made from strong chemicals that could be dangerous.\nProtect your skin and wear rubber gloves when handling varnish remover.\nBecause of the hazardous fumes from varnish remover, work outside or in an area that’s well ventilated.\nAlso stay away from open flames when working with varnish remover since it’s highly flammable.[12]",
                "Polish the brass. Make sure the brass is clean of all surface dust and dirt before you begin polishing. There are many kinds of commercial brass polishes, but you can make your own brass polish at home with lemon. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze all the juice from the half lemon into a small bowl. Add in either table salt or baking soda – it doesn’t matter which, the salt/baking soda is only acting as an abrasive – until you form a paste.[13] This might require about a teaspoon or more of salt or baking soda. Apply the paste to the brass piece using a soft cloth.\n\n\nMake sure you apply the paste going with the grain of the metal. If not, you could make tiny little scratches in the brass surface.\nDon’t rub the paste too harshly into the brass piece. The abrasive salt/baking soda will gently remove the tarnish.\nConsider using a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the nooks and hard to reach areas of your brass piece.[14]",
                "Consider polishing your brass with commercial cleaners. There are many eco-friendly brass cleaners that remove tarnish and restore shine to brass pieces without scratching and damaging the surface.\n\n\nSometimes, brass cleansers have an abrasive element in their formula, so be mindful to not damage fragile etchings on your brass piece.[15]\n\nStay way from muriatic acid. It does not properly clean brass, and can leave behind permanent stains.[16]\n\nUndiluted white vinegar or ammonia can be highly effective in cleaning antique brass. Allow the brass piece to soak for an hour in either vinegar or ammonia. Both products are natural cleaning agents, and can give brass a lasting, shiny finish.[17]",
                "Consider alternative brass cleaners. Although you can make your own brass cleaner at home or use commercial brass cleaners bought from the store, consider using some of these other natural ingredients to clean your brass pieces:\n\n\n\nKetchup. Use a soft cloth to slather your brass piece with ketchup. Let the ketchup sit on the brass surface for approximately 10 minutes, and then wipe the ketchup off with a clean, damp cloth. Dry the brass piece thoroughly.[18]\n\n\nYogurt. Cover your brass piece with plain yogurt. The lactic acid in the yogurt is what works to break down and dissolve the tarnishing on the brass. Allow the yogurt to dry on the brass, and then rinse it off with water, and dry the brass piece with a clean cloth.[19]\n\n\nWhite vinegar and salt. Cover the brass piece with white vinegar (either by pouring or spraying the vinegar over the brass surface), and then sprinkle salt over the vinegar.[20] Wet a cloth with a little bit of vinegar, and gently wipe down the brass. Dry with a clean cloth.",
                "Protect your brass from future tarnish. After you’re finished cleaning your brass piece, protect it from future tarnishing by applying a lacquered finish.[21] You can apply the lacquer using either a paintbrush or a cotton ball. Consult the instructions on the lacquer container to see the manufacturer’s suggestions.\n\n\nHowever you decide to apply the lacquer, be sure to only put on a thin layer. Watch for any dripping lacquer, because the drippings can dry, leaving your brass piece covered in drip streaks.[22]\n\nAllow the brass piece to dry thoroughly before touching. After the lacquer is dry, wipe the brass with a clean cloth to give it some shine.",
                "Determine if the piece is brass or brass-plated. It could be hard to differentiate if a brass piece is actual brass, or brass-plated. Hold a magnet near the brass piece and see if it's magnetically attracted to the brass. If the magnet does not stick, you are most likely handling brass. If the magnet does stick, it’s likely that your “brass” piece is actually a brass-plated piece of iron or steel.[23]\n\nAn alternative way to check if your piece is brass or brass-plated, is to use a sharp kitchen knife and scratch an inconspicuous part of the item. If the item is brass, the color in the scratch should be bright yellow.[24]\n\nIf the scratch mark is another color, like silver, then it is definitely another metal, and you still need to stick with non-abrasive cleaners so you don't remove the brass plating.",
                "Clean your lacquered brass-plated piece. Clean the entire brass-plated surface with a mixture of mild soap and cold to lukewarm water. Dip a cloth into the soapy water, wring out the cloth so it’s only slightly damp, and gently rub the surface of the brass piece.\n\n\nNever try to polish lacquered brass. The polish tends to turn the surface of the brass piece cloudy.[25]\n\nDon’t use cleaners containing ammonia on lacquered brass pieces, because the ammonia will break down the protective lacquer.[26]",
                "Clean your un-lacquered brass-plated piece. Dip a soft cotton cloth into a mixture of mild dish detergent and lukewarm water, wring out the cloth so it is only slightly damp, and gently wipe the surface of the brass piece clean.[27]\n\nYou can use an old toothbrush to clean out the nooks and crannies in the brass piece.",
                "Rinse and apply a mild polish. Rinse the brass piece with water, and dry it completely using a clean cloth.\n\n\nPolishing brass-plated items can potentially remove some of the brass plating. If you plan to polish your brass-plated object, do so very gently.[28]\n\nIt may be helpful to test the polish on an inconspicuous area of your brass-plated item before you polish the entire piece."

        "How to Get Clear Skin": {
            "intro": "A spotty, blemish-ridden complexion is a constant source of woe for many people. The problem starts in your teenage years and, while it may get better, it often needs continued attention into adulthood. Keep reading for advice about different tactics you should use in your pursuit of clear skin.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash your face daily. For best results, wash your skin once in the morning after you wake up and once at night before you go to bed.[1]\n\nYou should also consider washing your face after you hit the gym, go for a run, or take part in any activity that produces extra sweat.\nStick with a facial cleanser instead of using regular soap. Facial cleansers have gentle formulas, but standard soap is usually too coarse and may irritate the sensitive skin of your face.",
                "Resist the urge to pop your pimples. Scratching at acne and popping your pimples will cause inflammation and scarring. The added irritation can even cause more acne.",
                "Spot-treat your pimples as needed. You can use a cleanser with a special spot-treating formula to reduce the lifespan of a pimple by a day or two.\n\n\nApply the product early and often until the offending zit vanishes.",
                "Moisturize your skin. After washing your face, apply a gentle moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out. Choose a cream, gel, or serum that will rub into your skin completely to avoid clogging your pores.\n\n\nIf you do not moisturize your skin, you run the risk of causing dry, dead skin cells to clog your pores.",
                "Apply fresh cosmetics with clean brushes.[2] Bacteria can fester inside your makeup and inside the tools you use to apply it. This bacteria gets transferred to your skin, causing more acne to develop.\n\n\nThrow out any makeup over a year old, even if it still looks clean when viewed with the naked eye.\nWash loose powder brushes every two to three weeks. Wash foundation brushes once a week.\nThrow away sponges that are too thickly coated in makeup to clean.",
                "Remove your makeup before going to bed. Even clean cosmetics trap toxins, forcing your skin to come into contact with them. Remove your makeup before you go to sleep in order to reduce the amount of time your skin must be exposed to these toxins.",
                "Make your skin feel minty fresh.[3] The menthol in mint is known to have a cooling effect, but it also proves itself to be an effective cleansing agent suitable for skincare use.\n\n\nApply mint juice over your face every night to clear up any acne.\nClear body acne by crushing mint leaves into a paste and adding the juice of one lemon. Mix it with warm water until it becomes a thick liquid and apply it over your body. Rinse with warm water once dry.",
                "Use papaya. Papaya contains papain, an enzyme with antibacterial properties that also removes dead skin cells.\n\n\nReduce sun spots and freckles by regularly applying a papaya-based mask consisting of 1/4 cup (60 ml) cocoa powder, 2 tsp (10 ml) heavy cream, 1/4 cup (60 ml) ripe papaya, 1/4 cup (60 ml) honey, and 2 tsp (10 ml) oatmeal powder. Blend together to form a paste before applying it to your face. Rinse after 10 minutes.",
                "Apply turmeric. This herb lightens skin blemishes and has antiseptic properties.\n\n\nMix enough turmeric powder and pineapple juice to form a paste. Apply this paste to the dark bags under your eyes.\nMix 2 to 3 tsp (10 to 15 ml) sugarcane juice with a sprinkle of turmeric powder and apply to your face to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.",
                "Try crushed walnut. Applying walnut powder is a gentle way to exfoliate your skin and remove impurities lurking deep inside your pores.\n\n\nMix 2 tsp (10 ml) crushed walnuts or walnut powder with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) plain yogurt. Gently scrub the mixture onto your face and rinse off after 20 minutes.",
                "Make a rice flour pack. Rice flour is thought to reduce the appearance of wrinkles while clearing your complexion.\n\n\nMix 1/4 cup (60 ml) rice flour with 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey. Apply to your face and rinse after 20 minutes.",
                "Try neem powder. Neem has antiviral and antibacterial properties that makes it well-suited for the purpose of clearing clogged pores and pimples.\n\n\nMix 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) neem powder with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) plain yogurt. Apply to your skin and rinse off with cool water. Do this up to twice a week.",
                "Cut up a cucumber. Cucumbers are effective at hydrating the skin while acting as an astringent. Using cucumbers regularly can prevent pimples, wrinkles, and dry skin.\n\n\nMix equal parts cucumber and milk and use the combination instead of a commercial cleanser.\nRub cucumber juice onto blemishes.\nPlace cucumber slices of packs of grated cucumbers onto your eyes to rid yourself of dark bags.\nRinse well with cool water after 20 minutes.",
                "Try a face wash with salicylic acid. This ingredient helps regulate the pH balance of your skin and keep your pores clear before pimples can even form.[4]\n\nIf you have oily skin, look for a face wash made with 2 percent salicylic acid.\nFor dry skin, choose a sensitive formula that only contains 1 percent.",
                "Carry degreasing pads with you. Pre-moistened cloths containing salicylic acid can be used to cleanse oil from your skin immediately after you work up a sweat.\n\n\nYou do not need water when using these pads.\nWipe the pads over zones that are most likely to get clogged with sweat, including your forehead, nose, and chin.",
                "Choose a good facial lotion. Your skin needs to stay hydrated in order to remain healthy, clear, and free of dead, flaking skin.\n\n\nPick a moisturizer without oil to minimize the risk of clogging your pores.\nFor intensely acne-prone skin, use a moisturizing gel instead of a cream.",
                "Soothe your skin. Your skin can be pimple-free yet still appear red and inflamed. Apply an overnight gel if you have notably sensitive skin.\n\n\nLook for gels containing botanicals like aloe vera.",
                "Exfoliate once or twice a week. Exfoliating products usually contain slightly abrasive ingredients that remove dead skin cells and debris from your pores, thereby removing the environment bacteria needs in order to grow.\n\n\nExfoliating too much can lead to skin that is excessively dry and irritated, however.",
                "Consider using retinol. Retinol-based products are used to minimize the effects of aging and also clear up acne.\n\n\nGradually begin using retinol-based products by applying a night cream once or twice a week until your skin adjusts.",
                "Protect your skin against the sun. Avoid exposing your skin to the sun as often as possible. Wear a hat to shade your face from the sun when you expect to stay out for a prolonged period, and avoid sun-bathing.[5]\n\nYou should also consider apply sunscreen to offer the greatest amount of protection. Most sunscreens are oily by nature, so to reduce the risk of clogging your pores, choose a lotion specifically formulated for use on your face.\nSunlight can damage your skin in the long-run but it can also cause your pores to get clogged, preventing oil from escaping in the process.",
                "Stay active. Exercise regulates hormones, and many acne problems are related to hormonal shifts and surges. This is especially true of breakouts that occur during the teenage years.\n\n\nPlay sports or lift weights if either activity appeals to you. If not, at least go for walks or runs on a regular basis.\nWash your skin after breaking a sweat to prevent your pores from getting clogged.",
                "Get plenty of sleep each night. Sleep regulates the body's hormones and also reduces stress. Aim for 6 to 8 hours each night.",
                "Rest and relax as needed. Stress throws your hormones off, causes you to break into a sweat, and leads to an overall increase in acne. Calm yourself down after a hard day by doing something relaxing. By reducing your stress, you can reduce the number of future breakouts you experience. Possible stress-reducing activities include:\n\n\nTaking a bubble bath\nExercising\nMeditating\nListening to music\nPainting, drawing, or indulging in a calm and expressive activity\nWatching a movie or show\nReading a book",
                "Eat acne-fighting foods. Certain foods can keep your skin hydrated, healthy, free of irritation, and free of acne-causing toxins. Foods and drinks to gravitate toward include:\n\n\nWater and water-rich foods (including many fruits and vegetables)[6]\n\nFoods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, mackerel, seaweed, free-range eggs, walnuts, and dark green leafy vegetables\nFoods rich in flavonoids, like lettuce, citrus fruits, cabbage, lima beans, and kidney beans\nNettles\nArtichokes\nAlfalfa sprouts\nPeppermint\nBeetroot\nRed grapes\nAcai\nFennel\nTofu\nWhole grains\nGreen tea\nAvocado\nGarlic\nTomatoes\nDark berries\nSweet potato",
                "Know which foods to avoid. There are also foods generally linked to an increase in acne breakouts. Foods you should try to stay away from include:\n\n\nRefined grains, like commercial cereal, white bread, and white rice.\nRefined sugars, like chocolate, candy, soda, and cookies\nRich dairy, like milk or cream\nVegetable oils, like corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oils, and sesame oils"

                "Break large tasks down.[4] A good strategist knows how to work smarter and not harder. One way to work smart is to work your way through big projects by tackling smaller, manageable parts. This helps you beat excess stress and fend off procrastination. Plus, as you complete each part, you gain a greater sense of self-efficacy and confidence in your abilities.\n\n\nLook at the project as a whole and decide how it can be divided into several steps. What should be done first? Second? Third?\nCreate an action plan that allows you to complete each section in a logical order. Once every section is complete, review the project in its entirety before submitting.",
                "Seek input regularly. An effective strategist knows that continual growth requires taking a step back and reassessing one's methods. It also means seeking feedback from others. Getting input from others brings awareness to what's working or not working. It also reinforces the idea that success is a team effort.\n\n\nBe specific in your request. Ask, \"How do you suggest I handle this task?\" or \"How do you think I can improve my client relationships?\"[5]\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with the response, paraphrase the feedback so that the person knows you received it (e.g. \"So, you're saying I need to...\"). Then, thank the person for his input. It can be very effective to seek input from a range of sources--superiors and subordinates alike.",
                "Learn to delegate. Good strategists are highly impactful leaders. One technique that helps you to maximize that effectiveness is delegation. When you are tackling a difficult project in which a team member has the skills to assist, reach out for help. This strategy can greatly improve your performance and productivity.\n\n\nDelegation is an effective strategy because it enables those who are properly suited for specific tasks to handle them accordingly. That way you are not wasting time trying to retrain or learn new skills that someone on your team already has.\nAnother reason to delegate is to give other team members a chance to learn tasks that you do repeatedly, and, therefore, have already mastered.\nLet's say you have a big project that needs marketing, statistics, and writing work in order to be completed. You might reach out to your best people in those categories. Doing so will ensure that the project receives the most capable hands on deck.",
                "Surround yourself with effective people. A good strategist does not try to be the smartest man in the room. He does, however, know the smartest man in the room. Successful, effective people resonate an energy that is contagious. If you surround yourself with people who are empowering, resourceful, and motivated, you will be, too.\n\n\nIf you are not convinced that those you spend time with influence you, consider this. There is a popular personal development concept that describes any person as being the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.[6]\n\nEven if the metrics are not accurate, you have to know that others' good--and bad--habits can rub off on you. So, spend time with people who embody the qualities you, too, would like to possess.",
                "Reassess your progress. A big part of being a competent strategist is knowing when to switch tactics. Developing goals is wonderful, but you also must be willing to terminate a plan or incorporate new strategies if you are not getting the anticipated results.\n\n\nIf, upon reassessment, you find that you do not see the progress you would like, go back to step one. Consider what and why your methods are not working. Examine what resources you currently have at your disposal. Then, come up with some new ways of meeting your objectives.[7]\n\nKnow that it takes time to meet many goals. Don't switch strategies until you can confirm that the tactic is, in fact, not working. In some cases, you may not have given your methods enough time to show results.\nConsider this scenario: you are aiming to build up a long-term savings account. You were able to consistently deposit a set amount into the account every week. After successfully moving towards this goal for a period of time, you might decide to increase the amount you are depositing each week to meet your long-term goal faster.",
                "Be open-minded. If you are closed to new ideas and techniques, you limit yourself. An essential part of your arsenal as a strategist must be a willingness to be wrong, to be surprised, and to find inspiration in the most unlikely of places. If keeping an open mind poses a challenge for you, try the following tips:[8]\n\nListen more, even to those with lesser titles than you.\nReinforce those who have the courage to try new things or make changes.\nGather all the facts before making a decision.",
                "Build an always-learning attitude. A good strategist is like a sponge, constantly soaking up knowledge and experiences. Because science and technology are always evolving, you must understand that you, too, must educate yourself to stay abreast.[9][10]\n\nLearn by reading books, watching films and documentaries, and completing online and in-person training in your given area. Regularly acquire new skills.\nObserve others to see how they are doing things.\nAsk questions; never assume you know everything.",
                "Anticipate challenges and plan accordingly. A capable strategist has mastered the notion of foresight, or he has someone on his team who has this skill. Many great leaders and businesses are toppled because a new trend or technique rendered their old methods useless. In order to prevent this, one must anticipate and plan for challenges. Do this by:[11]\n\nStaying connected. Keep your finger on the pulse of the people. Know what their challenges are.\nResearching your area of expertise. Stay abreast of new trends, products, and the users' response to them.\nConsult with the customer or end-user. Consider their opinion on new initiatives.\nDevelop special teams to anticipate and respond to challenges."

        "How to Consolidate Financial Statements": {
            "intro": "Many large companies are partially or entirely made up of smaller companies that they've acquired throughout the years. After their acquisitions, these smaller companies, or subsidiaries, may have remained legally separate from the large corporation, or parent company. However, when reporting financial information, the parent company is required to submit financial statements that combine their information with that of their subsidiaries. These documents are called consolidated financial statements and allow the health of the group to be assessed as a whole, rather than piece-by-piece.[1] Consolidated financial statements can be created easily using the following steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine which holdings to report as subsidiaries. For the purpose of consolidated statements, a company is only considered a subsidiary if the parent company holds a controlling interest in that company. Generally, this means that the parent company owns over 50% of the shares of the subsidiary. This is because this share value would give them majority voting power in the subsidiary. However, there are situations where a company can be considered a subsidiary even when the parents owns a smaller percentage of their shares, such as:\n\n\nThe parent has majority voting rights by agreement with the subsidiary's board.\nThe parent has power to govern the policies of the subsidiary under agreement or law.\nThe parent has the ability to remove and replace the majority of the subsidiary's board.\nThe parent has the ability to cast the majority of votes during a meeting of the subsidiary's board of directors. [2]\n\nIn contrast, a parent may own more than 50% of a subsidiary's shares and not retain control. In this case, they are known as an \"unconsolidated subsidiary\" and not shown on consolidated statement.[3]",
                "Gather your paperwork together from all the companies. When you consolidate financial statements, you'll need all of the financial information for each company being considered. This will include information for the parent company as well. Specifically, you'll need access to the books (the record of all transactions) for each company, as books are not kept for the consolidated entity.[4]\n\nIt's easiest to start with the financial statements of the companies being considered if these have already been prepared. This will allow you to simply combine larger line items and go back through the books only to eliminate duplicate items.[5]",
                "Coordinate fiscal periods. In order to consolidate financial statements, you'll need to be sure that all companies' financial reports refer to the same fiscal period. Generally, if there is a mismatch in fiscal periods, you should modify subsidiary's timeline match that of the parent. This should either be done at acquisition or can be done through an adjustment to the subsidiary's financial statements.[6]\n\nFor example, if a subsidiary considers August 31 as its year end and the parent company's year end is December 31, then prepare financial statements for the first subsidiary running from January 1 through December 31. This may involve significant adjustment.",
                "Set up a spreadsheet. This should in a program that you can easily manipulate, like Microsoft Excel. Be sure to create separate pages for each combined financial statement you plan to create. At this point, just start by creating one for the consolidated balance sheet and one for the consolidated income statement.",
                "Add financial information for each company side-by-side. Set up your spreadsheet so that you can see where you'll be adding the information from different companies together. This will help you organize your information later. You'll also want to label the rows with what type of financial information you plan to input there.\n\n\nFor example, for the consolidated balance sheet, label your rows with common titles such as “Cash” or “Accounts Payable” and “Inventory.”",
                "Leave every third and fourth column blank for credit or debit consolidation adjustments. You'll need an area to record adjustments from duplicate transactions as you move forward with the process. Simply be sure to label these columns individually as credit and debit as you would in bookkeeping and label them collectively as \"duplicate adjustments\" or something similar.\n\n\nFor one subsidiary and one parent, simply fill the first two columns with their financial information and leave the next two blank for these adjustments. Leave the fifth column blank too for the eventual calculations of the final, adjusted values.\nFor multiple subsidiaries, follow this same pattern but separate the subsidiaries. In this case your spreadsheet columns should be laid out as follows:\n\n1.Parent financial information\n2.Subsidiary 1 financial information\n3.Adjustments (subsidiary 1)-debit\n4.Adjustments (subsidiary 1)-credit\n5.Consolidated financial information after subsidiary 1 adjustments\n5.Subsidiary 2 financial information\n6.(and on) repeat of process for other subsidiaries",
                "Check your financial statements again. Before combining them it's best to check the financial statements you will be using to ensure that they are for the same fiscal period. If not, you'll want to adjust them now. Going back and adjusting for this later will be much more work. In addition, check your financial statements for any missing information and seek to correct this before beginning to consolidate them.",
                "Create a consolidated balance sheet. Consolidate financial statements by creating a balance sheet that reflects a sum of net worth, assets and liabilities. This is done by simply adding together the separate values from the balance sheets of the parent company and the subsidiaries. The balance sheet will include assets like cash, receivables, and land, as well as liabilities like payable accounts and loans.[7][Image:Consolidate Financial Statements Step 10.jpg|center]]\n\n\nFor example, if the parent has $30,000 in cash and the subsidiary has $15,000 in cash, the consolidated balance sheet would show $45,000 in cash.",
                "Create a consolidated income statement. This document will include all revenues earned and expenses incurred by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Like the consolidated balance sheet, this is done by simply adding the values from the companies' independent income statements together. Included values are measures of money earned, including sales and net income, and also measures of expenses like cost of goods sold and wage expense.[8]\n\nFor example, if the parent company incurred $45,000 in income expense and the subsidiary incurred $20,000 in income expense, the consolidated income statement would show $65,000 in interest expense.",
                "Review the consolidated statements for duplicate values. After the statements have been consolidated, you'll need to check for instances that don't make financial sense. These situations arise when, for example, when money or assets have flowed between the parent and the subsidiary, or when the part of the value of the subsidiary is now reported twice by the parent. In general, the consolidated report should read like the financial statements of one company. Check for the following problems:\n\n\nThe consolidated company owning parts of itself (intercorporate stockholdings)\nThe company owing itself money (intercorporate receivables and payables)\nThe company selling items to itself for profit (intercorporate sales)[9]",
                "Eliminate intercorporate stockholdings. Intercorporate stockholdings refer to the situation where stock in the subsidiary is owned by the parent and is therefore not reportable as stock outstanding in the consolidated statement. Note that this is not true for subsidiary stock held by parties outside of the parent corporation or subsidiary.[10]\n\nAdjustments are made on the consolidated balance sheet by debiting the subsidiary's common stock, additional paid in capital, and retained earnings and crediting the consolidate stock of subsidiary account for the book value of the intercorporate shares.[11]",
                "Account for intercorporate receivables and payables. These refer to situations where, after consolidation, a company can appear to owe itself money. This arises from situations where a parent company owes money to or receives money from a subsidiary for products or services. This results in unnecessarily high values for some of the combined accounts.[12]\n\nAdjustments for this situation are made on the balance sheet by debiting consolidated accounts payable or crediting consolidated accounts receivable by the book value of the duplicated entry.[13]",
                "Delete any intercorporate sales. By transferring inventory between parents and subsidiaries, either party may technically realize a profit, even though no sale has been made. This results in overstated inventory, net income, and retained earnings for the consolidated company.[14]\n\nCorrect this imbalance on the balance sheet by debiting retained earnings of the consolidated entry and crediting consolidated ending inventory by the amount of the sales.[15]"

            "intro": "Sedation is a relaxed, calm or tranquil state induced after the administration of drugs. When a dog is sedated, he becomes more docile and can easily be handled, making it less stressful for the dog when procedures like grooming and veterinary examinations are being done. Without sedation, stressful situations can lead to restlessness, and when a dog is restless it is more prone to hurt itself, not eat, hide and hurt or bite other people and animals.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand that you must get a prescription for sedative drugs. The drugs used to sedate a dog are very effective, so they require a prescription from a veterinarian and can only be administered by a veterinarian.\n\n\nThe two most common drugs used by veterinarians to calm dogs are acepromazine (PromAce®), and diazepam (Valium®).\nThese drugs block certain signals in the CNS or central nervous system making the animal calm or sedated.",
                "Give your dog Acepromazine (PromAce®). Acepromazine is used to calm fractious or aggressive animals. It alleviates itching, and also has anti-emetic properties (prevents vomiting), making it ideal for animals that are being transported long distances.",
                "Consider giving your dog Diazepam (Valium®). Diazepam is also a sedative which has muscle relaxant properties, appetite stimulating properties, and anti-convulsant properties, making it ideal for dogs with seizure and/or appetite problems.",
                "Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise. Many experts on dog behavior recommend that a dog be exercised before travelling, or before being engaged in any activity that might get the dog restless and agitated.\n\n\nA well exercised dog will be very inclined to rest because it has burned off its excess energy. Therefore, it's a good idea to schedule a brisk 30 minute walk before taking off.",
                "Bring your dog’s favorite toys, blanket or rug when travelling. Your dog’s favorite blanket or toys contain a lot of familiar scents, and will reduce anxiety when the dog is brought to an unfamiliar place.",
                "Try aromatherapy. Do this by placing a few drops of lavender oil on your hands and massaging the dog at the back of its head, or the base of the spine. Lavender oil has a calming scent and is used in spas for humans.",
                "Use products that contain appeasing pheromones. Studies have shown that pheromones are present in all mammals during the nursing stage. In dogs, this is the hormone secreted by the puppies’ mother, so when the puppies smell this hormone it calms them and re-assures them that mom is around.\n\n\nExamples of products that contain this hormone are: Adaptil ®collar and spray, Sentry ® Calming collar, and Comfort Zone ® Diffuser with Dog Appeasing Pheromone.[1]\n\nThese products are very easy to use, the collars are simply placed on the dog’s neck to provide a sustained release of the pheromone which lasts for a month.\nFor products like the diffuser, it is simply plugged into a socket, and the pheromone is slowly and continuously released for a month. This type of product is ideal for rooms. Spray preparations can be used to spray cages, cars, or any carrier where the dog is placed.",
                "Use melatonin supplements. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. It is a sleeping hormone that causes the animal to have a good rest at night. It has a seasonal variation in animals and humans, increasing when there are fewer hours of daylight in winter.\n\n\nMelatonin has sedative properties, anticonvulsant properties, regulates body rhythms and reproductive cycles. It is mainly used in the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs, and other stressful or frightening conditions like noise anxieties brought about by fireworks or thunder storms.\nGive this drug to your dog before travelling and or before introducing your dog to a potentially frightening situation. An example of a product containing Melatonin is K9 Choice ™ Melatonin 3 mg tablets.\nThe dose is 3 mg for every 35 to 100 pounds body weight, twice a day. For smaller dogs below 35 pounds the dose is 1.5 mg of melatonin, and for larger dogs greater than 100 pounds the dose is 6 mg twice times a day.[2]",

        "How to Grow Kohlrabi": {
            "intro": "Popular in Germany and India, the kohlrabi is named after the German words for cabbage (kohl) and turnip (rübe), and the crisp and versatile vegetable does resemble both its namesakes. This hardy biennial is often grown as an annual. It is easy to grow in mild climates, making it a unique and delicious addition to any garden. You can learn to plant and care for kohlrabi to give your crop the best possibility of success.",
            "steps": [
                "Select a variety of kohlrabi. Kohlrabi is a brassica, in the cabbage family. Increasingly popular, kohlrabi is also available in different varieties, all easy to grow, with slight variations in look and time to maturity. The biggest difference is whether or not you pick a green or purple variety.\n\n\nGreen kohlrabi varieties include the Korridor and the Winner, which mature quickly, in about 50 days, compared to about 60 for some other varieties. Bright lime-green in color, they make an attractive addition to a garden bed.\nPurple kohlrabi varieties like the Azur Star and Kolibri are particularly bug-resistent, because of the purple leaves on the plant, which keep the insects away. Taste-wise, you won't notice much difference.\nStorage varieties like Kossak, Superschmelz, and Gigante are, as you might guess, much larger than the regular varieties of kohlrabi. They'll last longer in the cellar or the fridge, prepared correctly. Taste-wise, these varieties are all very similar.",
                "Select a planting location for kohlrabi. Kohlrabi should be planted in full sun, close to other roots, like potatoes, beets, onions. Kohlrabi are big drinkers and feeders, which means they'll need a good amount of water and fertile soil. It's usually recommended that you plant five or six cabbage-family plants for each member of the household. Sow three times the amount.\n\n\nKohlrabi should be kept in a separate part of the garden from pole beans, tomatoes, and strawberries.",
                "Prepare the soil for sowing. Several weeks before the last frost of spring, Kohlrabi may be planted, which means you can start tilling your soil early. Kohlrabi should be planted in well-tilled soil enriched with compost. It's hardy in most conditions, though it excels in soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8.[1]\n\nGood drainage is also helpful in avoiding rot and blight in your kohlrabi plants, so make sure you've got an area of the garden that doesn't collect water too much.",
                "Plant kohlrabi in cool weather. Kohlrabi is a hardy grower that should be planted about a month before the last frost in spring. Ideally, you want the plant to mature before the temperature gets much over 75 F, which means you’ll want to plant it early, among your earliest sows, probably, in an area with a very hot summer. Kohlrabi will mature in 50-60 days.\n\n\nIf you live in a place with warm winters, it’s also common to plant kohlrabi in late autumn to harvest in early winter. The plant should be able to withstand autumn frosts.\nIf winter's running long, you can start kohlrabi in pots indoors and move the plants outside about a month before the first frost, then plant them after they have hardened.",
                "Plant seeds in an even row. Kohlrabi seeds should be sowed in moist soil about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep and an inch apart, a single seed in each hole. Use your finger to make a small indent in the ground, then cover the seeds loosely with soil. Leave at least an inch between each plant, which you'll thin out later.\n\n\nKohlrabi should be planted in rows, which should be spaced about a foot apart to give them room to spread out and mature.",
                "Weed carefully and regularly. When you see your starts coming up, weed around them very carefully, paying special attention to milkweed, thistle, and any other local weeds. Kohlrabi are easily beaten out in the beginning, and have a shallow root structure, since the bulb is above ground. The most critical time for kohlrabi is in the first couple of weeks. Let them flourish, then thin them out.",
                "Thin successful seedlings about 5–8 inches (12.7–20.3 cm) apart. After a couple of weeks, the plants should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) tall and you can start thinning out the most successful of them to give them room to grow. Carefully dig up the plants and re-space them, so they're about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart, moving some to other places in the garden if necessary.\n\n\nThe greens of young kohlrabi can be eaten raw, in salads, or can be thrown into stir-frys as any field green. It's a unique and nutrient-rich way of spicing up a meal.",
                "Mulch plants with compost. Once the plants are 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) tall, you should provide them a bit of structure and nitrogen support. Pack some compost around the base of kohlrabi to help hold them up and inject some nutrients into the soil. This can be the big difference between healthy-looking big bulbs and woody inedibles.",
                "Water deeply and frequently. Kohlrabi need lots of water, and do well in relatively mild or Mediterranean climates. If the soil is dry, under-watered kohlrabi will become woody and unpleasant to eat. If the split striations on the bulb start to look dry, increase your waterings.\n\n\nWhen watering, water the soil around the base of each bulb, don't water on top of the plants, which can increase the possibility of rot. This goes for most cabbage.",
                "Watch closely for cutworms. Kohlrabi and other cabbages are susceptible to cutworms, making it important that you stay on top of these pests as your plants mature. You'll notice holes in the leaves and egg clusters on the underside of the leaves. If you find this, move swiftly.\n\n\nWash leaves with egg clusters on them thoroughly, removing the eggs as you find them. It’s common to “collar” the leaf stems of the kohlrabi by tying them up to get the leaves off the ground. This can help to keep the infestation at bay. You can use Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) if you’ve got a serious problem.[2]\n\nKeep an eye out for rot, as well. “Cabbage yellows” is easy to recognize, due to the yellowish-brownish color the leaves will take on. Remove infected plants entirely.",
                "Harvest kohlrabi by pulling up the entire plant. Kohlrabi is usually ready to be harvested after about 45-60 days. The stem should be about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in diameter, and the bulbs will be big and healthy-looking. The bulbs of different varieties will grow to different sizes, so you'll partially be using your judgment. If you let them go too long, kohlrabi will become slightly woody and unpleasant.\n\n\nThe length of time that it takes to grow depends on growing conditions and which variety you are growing.",
                "Enjoy kohlrabi raw or cooked. Kohlrabi have a crisp texture and a mild flavor that makes them a versatile and nutrient-rich food for your table. It's like a cross between a cabbage and an apple, sweet and savory at the same time. Roast it up with other root vegetables, bake and mash kohlrabi, or serve it in a mixed vegetable sauté.\n\n\nKohlrabi is eaten in Germany as a bar snack, dressed with salt, cut into slices, and served raw. It's maybe the best possible way to eat this crunchy vegetable, served with a mug of beer."

            "intro": "Over the past few decades, the prepared food industry has boomed as consumers increasingly rely on quick and easy meals to accommodate their busy schedules. Pizza, one of the most popular prepared foods, can be tailored to fit numerous tastes and has become a staple product of thousands of take-out and delivery pizza businesses. However, it's important for any entrepreneur to be aware that the majority of new prepared food businesses fail in their first year due to lack of essential business strategy and management skills.",
            "steps": [
                "Gain culinary experience. Though you don't need any certification to start a pizza business, it's a good idea to attend a culinary trade school where you'll learn to cook more than pizza. Offering additional dishes on the menu could attract more customers for your own pizza business.\n\n\nWhether you actually attend culinary school or spend years working in a pizzeria, the important thing is to gather the experience you’ll need to help your business be successful. This could be done through formal education or through hands-on experience.[1]\n\nSome pizza chefs recommend traveling to Italy for an apprenticeship to learn the original art of making delicious pizza.",
                "Take some business classes. Even though you will be involved in the food industry, it is still important to have some kind of business savvy under your belt. You will be responsible for ensuring your business runs smoothly and providing your employees with reliable income. So it will be beneficial for you to gain some insight on the business aspects of running a pizza place.",
                "Get experience in the industry. Check out other pizza businesses and see how they run. Spend some time learning the ropes at another pizza business and do your research. The insights you'll gain about not only how to make a good pizza, but also how to run a business, will be useful for your own endeavor.[2]",
                "Figure out what kind of pizza place you want to open. Write a business plan that includes a description of your pizza business, the market you intend to sell to, your marketing strategy, projected revenue, taxes, and start-up costs.[3]\n\nThere are many types of pizzerias, so spend some time thinking about what kind you want to create. There are family-style pizza joints, pizzerias with traditional wood stoves, buffet style pizza places, pizza by the slice, among others. You should also choose whether you want to offer delivery service or dine in and take out only.[4]\n\nThere are also many styles of pizza to choose between – like Chicago-style deep dish, Sicilian, Neopolitan, thin crust, gourmet, etc.[5]\n\nDeciding what kinds of food you want to serve is important, but remember that most pizza consumers prefer quality over quantity.[6]\n\nYou will also need to decide on what complementary food to serve. You may want to include salads for your more health-conscious customers. Or maybe you’ll want to include an excellent dessert menu with tiramisu and flan. Some more common menu items at pizza restaurants are varieties of pasta dishes, breadsticks, calzones.",
                "Figure out a way to set your business apart. As customers, people are overwhelmed with options for eating out. Why should they choose your restaurant? Think about what you can do to make your restaurant stand out from the crowd. Maybe this means coming up with a cool decorative theme. Maybe it means offering over-the-top customer service every day. Maybe it means you initiate some kind of gimmick like unlimited free drinks if they buy a special cup from your store. Whatever your decision, you need to choose something that will make your customers want to come back to your business (and to pick it in the first place).",
                "Choose between a franchise or an independent operation. While buying into a franchise definitely has its perks (already established name brand with loyal customers), going independent means that you have full control over your business and your finances.[7]",
                "Choose a logo. Your logo is a very important part of branding your product/business. [8] Create a logo (or hire a graphic designer to do so) that is aesthetically pleasing and memorable, but make sure that the logo clearly represents what kind of business you are. People are more attracted to logos that are easy to decipher than those that seem unrelated to a topic.",
                "Enlist the help of a realtor. Getting the help of a realtor as you look for the perfect place to open your business will make your life a lot easier. Realtors are experts at choosing locations and they will have advice to guide you in your choice.\n\n\nTry to choose a realtor that has experience with commercial property, especially in dealing with restaurant locations.\nWhen choosing a location, it is important to know the area and keep your expected clientele in mind. For example, if you choose a location in a low-income area and decide to open a gourmet pizza place with expensive pies, your business may suffer.[9]",
                "Look at available properties in your budget. Make sure you keep your budget in mind as you search for properties. Think about what you can reasonably afford (remembering that it will probably take time for you to start making money from your business) and only look at locations in that price range. Also consider any additional costs like required renovations, decorating, and taxes.[10]\n\nYour pizza business itself may require some renovations – like installing wood pizza ovens or additional seating for customers.",
                "Think about visibility and access. Choose a location for your pizza business that is accessible, visible, and provides plenty of traffic to attract customers. Check with your city to see if it's zoned for a food company before you sign any lease agreement.[11]\n\nA good location is crucial, especially for a successful restaurant. Because pizza is such a popular food, a great location for your pizzeria would be in high traffic areas – like busy downtown streets, near shopping malls, close to college campuses, etc.",
                "Make sure you are compliant with all laws. Schedule an appointment with your local health and safety authority to check your location. If all is in compliance with health and safety regulations, you will be issued a permit that allows you to conduct business.[12]\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind that you will need to acquire a liquor license if you want to be able to serve alcohol at your pizza establishment. This is another thing you will need to look into with your local health and safety authority, as regulations vary from state to state.\nIf you are interested in starting a pizza business in your home, you can do so as long as you make sure you apply for a proper food license.[13] Without this license, it will be illegal for you to prepare and serve food to people for money – so don’t skip this step. Check with your local city hall to find out exactly what attaining the license entails since regulations can vary from place to place.",
                "Determine how much startup money you need. Think about all of the costs associated with running your business and how long you think it will be before you start turning a profit. Typically, new businesses don’t make money until after the first year. You will probably need to invest a lot of time and money before the business starts showing returns.\n\n\nThese costs include rent and utilities at your location, equipment costs, supply costs, advertising fees, employee salaries, among other things.",
                "Get a business loan. Go to your bank and see if you can get approved for a business loan. You will need to provide the loan officer with a detailed business plan including expected costs and the eventual rate of return as well as projections regarding eventual profit.\n\n\nAdditionally, look into grants and loans from the Small Business Administration.[14]\n\nCheck out Get a Business Loan, Get a Small Business Loan, or Get SBA Small Business Loans for more information.",
                "Check out what support your city offers for small businesses. Many cities offer financial support for small businesses in their area. You should go to your local chamber of commerce and find out what kind of assistance you are eligible for.[15]",
                "Borrow from private investors. Obtain the capital you need from private investors. These are people who are willing to finance your business.",
                "Acquire the necessary equipment. Buy equipment for your pizza business. You'll need a refrigerator and freezer, gas ovens, a dough mixer, a butcher block table, pans and racks, measuring cups, flat bottom ladles, pizza boxes, napkins, and if you're planning to deliver pizzas, a delivery vehicle.[16]\n\nThis list, however, is not comprehensive. You should consider asking someone who already owns a pizza business for a complete listing of all the equipment they use on a daily basis in their business.",
                "Create a menu. Decide what kinds of foods and beverages you will sell and create a menu. You should consider including assorted pizzas as well as other Italian dishes. Be clear and plan the design carefully. Make sure you proof your menu for errors.[17]",
                "Hire employees. You’ll need a dependable staff to maintain a smoothly running business. Interview employees, and hire those that are reliable, personable, and efficient.[18]",
                "Fill out all necessary forms and applications.[19] You should apply for an employer's identification number (EIN) from the appropriate tax authority. You'll need an EIN to legally hire employees.\n\n\nAlso make sure to register your pizza business with your city if necessary to obtain a business license.",
                "Make ads. Design advertisements that are pleasing to look at and offer all of the necessary information about your business – the location, the goods you provide (pizza), your contact information, etc.[20]",
                "Advertise in local newspapers or on the internet. Advertise your pizza business in the local media, on flyers, and on the Internet. It is important for people to see your advertisements so that you can start drawing more business.\n\n\nCheck out How to Advertise, Promote Your Business, or Advertise Your Business for Free for more tips.\nConsider joining websites like Yelp so that customers can leave online feedback for others to see.[21]",
                "Word of mouth. Tell all of your friends about your new pizza business. Ask them to come try your food. The fastest way for your business to gain popularity is by people telling others about it.[22]",
                "Offer discounts. A good way to get people to try a new restaurant is by luring them in with discounts and great deals. Include coupons or other discounts in your paper or online advertisements.[23] However, understand that this is a temporary push to gain new customers, not a long term fix. If you continue offering discounts for too long, it will negatively impact your brand image."

        "How to Use a Chocolate Fountain": {
            "intro": "Chocolate fountains are a great addition to any party or event. They are a fun way to serve food and delight guests. You can dip a variety of fruits and snacks under the running chocolate, so you’ll also be able to have multiple accompaniments at your event. Learning how to use a chocolate fountain is simple: you just have to choose your model wisely, assemble it well, and serve great snacks alongside the melted chocolate.",
            "steps": [
                "Wash the parts. Use warm soapy water to get rid of any dirt or dust that the parts may have accumulated while in the box. Allow the parts to air-dry.",
                "Attach the auger tube to the base. The fountain you purchase will come with instructions on how to do this for your specific model. For any model, the tube should stand straight from the base. If your auger tube has multiple parts, you will first need to lock these together to create a longer tube.[1]\n\nSome parts may already be assembled depending on the brand of fountain that you buy.",
                "Attach the tiers to the auger tube, if applicable. Slide the largest tier down the auger first, locking it into place, then slide the second-largest tier, and so forth.\n\n\nSlide your tiers face-down so that they don't trap and hold your chocolate as it runs down the fountain.\nSome fountains will already come with the tiers attached to the auger tube.",
                "Install the auger. The auger looks like a corkscrew and is what drives the chocolate up the fountain. Slide the auger down the center of the auger tube and twist it clockwise into the base until you feel a light resistance - this means your auger is locked and ready to use.",
                "Lock the crown in place. The crown secures the auger from the top end and is the finishing touch on your fountain.",
                "Test the fountain. Plug it into the electricity and run the machine without chocolate to ensure that you’ve got a fully functioning fountain. Don’t turn on the heat.",
                "Buy chocolate. You can use any sort of chocolate in your fountain. However, a couverture chocolate, which is of higher quality and contains 32-39% cocoa butter, can taste better and look silkier when running in the fountain.[2]\n\nIf you decide to use any other sort of chocolate, add 1 cup of vegetable or canola oil per 5 pounds (2.3kg) of chocolate to soften the texture.[3]",
                "Melt the chocolate. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave (for at least three minutes) or with a double-boiler. After the chocolate has melted, place it in tubs inside a plastic or Styrofoam cooler so as to insulate it from the outside and keep it warm and liquid.[4]\n\nMelt the chocolate only a couple of hours before your event so that it will remain warm and liquid.",
                "Pour the melted chocolate into the base of the fountain. You can now turn your chocolate fountain on. The chocolate will travel up the central column and run down the sides into the base of the fountain. Once it’s in the basin, it will be pulled up the central column once more and the cycle will repeat.[5]\n\nFollow the instructions in the manual that came with your fountain to know just how much chocolate you should be pouring.",
                "Set the fountain in place. Chocolate fountains tend to be the main attraction at any snack bar, so place the fountain in the middle of the table for the best effect. The table should be sturdy and close to a wall with an electrical plug.\n\n\nTape the electrical cord to the ground so your guests won’t trip over it.\nPlace the table far away from the dance floor or from any areas with swinging doors or air conditioning ducts. If possible, refrain from using your fountain outdoors. You want your chocolate to stay warm and for the fountain not to tip over.[6]",
                "Place a tablecloth underneath your fountain. Dipping food in a chocolate fountain can get messy fast! Chocolate will drip and splash. Prevent any incidents by placing a tablecloth on your table. Choose a tablecloth in a dark color so that chocolate drips don’t show.",
                "Pair the fountain with great snacks. Snacks that go well with melted chocolate include pretzels, cut-up pieces of pound cake, and meringues.\n\n\nMake sure your snacks are in bite-size pieces so it’s easier for guests to dip their servings in the chocolate.",
                "Serve fresh fruit. Bananas, strawberries, dried apricot, maraschino cherries, grapes, and pineapple are all perfect accompaniments to dip in your chocolate fountain.[7]\n\nYou can also serve more exotic fruits such as star fruit, dragon fruit, or coconut chunks. These also pair well with melted chocolate.\nDry your washed fruit so that the chocolate will adhere more easily.",
                "Supply skewers, toothpicks, paper plates and napkins. You should plan to have enough skewers and plates for each of your guests. Place these near the snacks and fruit so that people can help themselves in a clean, germ-free way.\n\n\nPlace a small garbage can near the table so that guests can throw away their dirty places and used skewers.",
                "Dip the snacks in the chocolate. Poke a snack or a piece of fruit with a skewer or toothpick and bring it up to the fountain. Place the food under the running chocolate, covering just the food and not the toothpick or skewer. Rotate the skewer or toothpick so that your entire snack or piece of fruit gets covered in chocolate. Enjoy!\n\n\nThe chocolate will drip from the snack or fruit, so place a plate under the dipped item to keep your clothes from getting spots!",
                "Check the fountain throughout the event. Food can fall into the chocolate basin, where the chocolate is heated, and jam your fountain. If this happens, turn off and unplug the fountain immediately, retrieve the snack or piece of fruit, and plug the fountain back in.[8]\n\nAsk for a volunteer to “guard” the fountain. This person can ask people not to double-dip their snacks as well as turn the fountain off if they notice that an item has fallen into the basin.[9]",
                "Remove chocolate from the fountain when the event ends. You can do this with a simple washcloth or with paper towels. Pour excess chocolate into the garbage can.\n\n\nIf your chocolate cools, it will harden, making the task of cleaning the fountain an arduous one. If the chocolate has hardened, turn the heating element on to re-melt the chocolate. Use a hair dryer to hurry the melting by aiming the warm air to the tiers and auger tube.[10]",
                "Place the fountain in a large plastic bag. Double-bag the fountain, if possible. The fountain will still have chocolate inside, so carry it home this way to avoid a mess.",
                "Disassemble and clean the fountain. If the fountain has dishwasher-proof pieces, remove these, clean them in warm soapy water, and place them in the dishwasher. Scrub any pieces you cannot wash in the dishwasher with a soft sponge and soapy water.[11]\n\nThe motor and the pump should never be placed in the dishwasher. These are electrical hazards.[12]\n\nCheck your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to most efficiently wash your chocolate fountain."

            "intro": "Are you looking for a thick creamy chocolate milkshake that you can make easily with just a few simple ingredients? Create the perfect Nesquik[1] chocolate milkshake to enjoy on a hot day or as an after dinner treat.",
            "steps": [
                "Stick a tall glass in the freezer (optional). Whether you're using a tall glass or a classic metal cup, popping it in the freezer for a few minutes will keep your milkshake frosty as you sip it. There's no need to stand around – get started on the milkshake while you wait.",
                "Let your ice cream soften. Using ice cream straight from the freezer can make your milkshake taste dilute, thin, or icy. You'll have much better results if you leave the ice cream out on the counter for about ten minutes, until it's soft and just beginning to melt around the edges.[2]\n\nOn a hot day, put the ice cream in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes instead.\nHeating the ice cream too fast can ruin the texture. This gentle method is best.\nSkip this step if using frozen yogurt.",
                "Combine your ingredients. Add 2 large scoops of the softened ice cream or frozen yogurt to a blender or milkshake maker. Use a large stainless steel bowl instead if you don't have a blender.[3] Add ¼ cup (60 mL) milk for a thick milkshake, or up to a full cup (240 mL) if you prefer a thinner drink. Add ½ cup Chocolate Nesquik powder.\n\n\nWhole milk makes a richer shake, while low fat or skim milk is a healthier option.\nFor an extremely rich milkshake, also blend in 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) heavy whipping cream.\nCrushed ice will dilute your milkshake's flavor. Use extra milk instead to thin the shake, and pop the milkshake in the freezer for a few minutes if it's too runny.\nIf you like a thicker shake consistency, start out with 1/4 cup of milk and add more until you are satisfied with the texture.",
                "Blend. This is easiest with a blender, milkshake maker, or stick blender, on a low setting. If you don't have one of these, burn off some calories in advance with a sturdy whisk.\n\n\nSemi-frozen ice cream is easiest to blend with a series of short pulses, or with a sturdy fork instead of a whisk. If it still won't blend, mash it against the sides with a rubber spatula or flat spoon and try again.[4]",
                "Serve in a cold glass. Taste before you pour it into the glass, so you have the option to blend in more milk (thinner) or more ice cream (thickener). Serve with a spoon or thick straw and enjoy immediately.",
                "Get creative with the ice cream. You don't have to use vanilla. You can create whatever flavor you desire. Try chocolate, rockey-road, chocolate chip ice cream or any flavor you like.",
                "Make it fancy. Top your milkshake off with a dash of cinnamon, some whipped cream, or a Maraschino cherry. Drizzle chocolate syrup over the top of the shake or on the inside of the glass.",
                "Add chunky sweets. Enter special dessert territory with these solid ingredients. For best results, add after the shake is blended. Leave them on top of the shake or pulse for a few seconds to mix slightly without compromising the texture. Here are a few ideas:\n\n\nRoughly crush chocolate cookies or small brownies into several pieces.\nAdd toasted marshmallows, or even an entire small s'more.[5]\n\nFor a Chocolate Peanut Smoothie, blend in 1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter.[6]\n\nFor a Fruit Smoothie, blend in 1 cup strawberries, raspberries, or bananas.\nFor a fun twist, add a handful of gummy bears."

        "How to Treat Razor Bumps": {
            "intro": "Have you ever wondered just what you're doing wrong when it comes to shaving? It's not like it's rocket science, you know?! Luckily, with just a few small adjustments to your routine, you can become a razor bump rocket scientist in a matter of days. Get started with Step 1 below.",
            "steps": [
                "Try exfoliating. What you're really dealing with is a cluster of ingrown hairs. They may look like acne, but they're not. To lessen the problem, first try exfoliating. That will rub off the top layer off skin, possibly freeing the hairs from their derma-prison.\n\n\nMake sure what you're dealing with is razor bumps. If they're pink or red (or dark if you can see the hair) and itchy, then razor bumps it is. They also may resemble whiteheads if pus has formed on top. B-E-A-utiful!",
                "If that doesn't work, use salicylic or glycolic acid. So, since we're dealing with ingrown hairs here, what you've gotta do is remove that layer of skin on top. Salicylic and glycolic acid do just that.\n\n\nThese two products quicken the turnover of dead skin cells -- that is to say, the layers you shed will be shed more quickly when this stuff is applied to your skin. Though it may not expose the ingrown hair, it will speed up the process.",
                "If that doesn't work, use a needle and tweezers, or a rotatable medical device to release the embedded hair. Make sure the needle is clean first! Sterilize it with rubbing alcohol if it's not brand new. Insert it into the top of the bump (blood or pus may come out) and switch to your tweezers. Carefully coax out the hair like you would a splinter -- plucking it straight off may lead the next hair to be ingrown, too.[1]\n\nThis needs to be done very carefully. It can potentially damage the skin and in the absolute worst cause scenario, result in scarring. Almost as bad as the bumps themselves!",
                "Don't shave the irritated area. Hopefully, this seems logical to you. Shaving is how you got the bumps in the first place, so shaving more will just exacerbate the problem. If you can, avoid doing so. And if there's a no-facial-hair requirement you have to meet for work or school, consider getting a doctor's note to get around the rule.",
                "Avoid products with alcohol. That stuff just irritates and burns your skin, dries it up and leaves it worse for the wear. And if you have razor bumps, that's a recipe for disaster and pain. If your normal lotion has it, you'd be wise to toss 'er out.\n\n\nThe only, only time you should use alcohol on your skin is the cleanse the area before using a needle. And then you should use rubbing alcohol -- no other kind.",
                "Use products with lidocaine and bacitracin. Many aftershave products have lidocaine in them. That's the ingredient that prevents itching and irritation. Bacitracin is the stuff found in products like Neosporin and is used to kill bacteria. You probably don't need an explanation as to why these two things are beneficial!\n\n\nThese products can be used on bumps and on unaffected skin. They're good treatments and preventative measures.",
                "Don't scratch! The razor bumps may become infected if you do. You're just spreading around bacteria and mixing it in with the stuff on your hands (clean as they may feel). In general, staying away from your face entirely is your best bet.",
                "Scrub your face twice a day with a facial cleanser or a bump brush. Keeping your face clean is a large part of the razor bump battle. You want to keep bacteria at bay and also keep the top-most layer of your skin fresh.\n\n\nIf you're shaving (...which you shouldn't be doing on the bumps), use warm water to soften the hairs and loosen the follicles. Cold hair just tightens up your skin and won't do you any favors.",
                "Apply an anti-razor bump cream. Do this twice a day, in the morning and at night. There are a solid half a dozen products on the market to choose from, and all should be of similar quality. A quick visit to your local drugstore (Wal-Greens, CVS, Boots, or Waitrose) should be all you need to take.[2]\n\nIf you'd rather look for something that may already be in your bathroom cabinet, a hydrocortisone cream or other antibacterial cream can help lessen inflammation and redness, too. Retin-A cream works as well.[3]",
                "Shave with the grain. Against the grain may feel like it results in a closer shave, but shaving with the grain will keep the hairs aligned. When the hairs are aligned, they're less likely to curl up and become ingrown.",
                "Use the right aftershave. Avoid putting chemicals like alcohol, or treatments that contain alcohol, on the shaved area. Your skin is super sensitive at this juncture, so it's best to use non-perfumed, no-alcohol substances. Read the label if you have any doubt.\n\n\nGo for one that's super moisturizing. Choose an alcohol, fragrance and oil-free moisturizing lotion to make sure the skin doesn't get irritated. According to the department of Dermatology of the Langone Medical Center, products that contain salicylic or glycolic acid are the most effective in treating razor bumps. These ingredients clear the pores, moisturize and prevent infections.",
                "Consider laser treatment or electrolysis. If desperate times call for desperate measures, you do have more permanent ways out. Consult a registered, experienced dermatologist for more advice on the matter.\n\n\nDepending on your hair type and how much hair you'd like removed, laser hair removal may not be as expensive as you think it is. A session for just the neck could be as little as $150. It may be worth looking into!",
                "Exfoliate all the time. Exfoliating prior to shaving and after should become integral to your shaving routine. The first step aligns the hairs and gets rid of dead skin cells to get a smoother more even cut and the second time around wipes away all the up-churned bacteria and skin that can clog otherwise clean pores.\n\n\nSo if you have razor bumps already, exfoliating will force away the very top layer of dead skin cells, in time exposing the hair that is curled up underneath. The more you exfoliate, the quicker this process will go.",
                "Use creams and lotions to fight the redness and itch. Every time you shave, you should finish off with a moisturizer. Aloe vera, baby oil, or any non-scented, non-perfumed lotion will do. But to treat razor bumps, consider also using a razor bump cream or other, anti-inflammatory cream.\n\n\nHydrocortisone creams, retin-A creams, and products like Neosporin will reduce redness and itch. Products with salicylic acid or glycolic acid (for in razor bump creams) will eliminate the top layer of skin, to get rid of the ingrown hair.",
                "Change to waxing (or don't shave!). Some people have very sensitive skin, especially around their pubic area. To avoid the razor but still be hairless, switch to waxing. However, know that waxing can lead to histamine reactions and ingrown hairs, too -- so take the pain with a grain of salt.\n\n\nThe other option is not to shave. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not an option. But really, would you rather have some hair growing in or little red bumps? Because right now it's one or the other. Try skipping a few days between shaves if you shave often. You'll live.",
                "Wear loose underwear. You want to avoid as many possible irritants as possible when you've got a case of the bumps, and tight clothing is at the top of that list. Wearing tight undies doesn't let your skin breathe and as a result, the skin clogs, bacteria gets trapped, and the problems get worse. No thank you!\n\n\nGo for loose clothing if you can, too. The bumps around your thighs won't benefit from tight jeans or leggings. If anyone asks why you're wearing sweats, well, for starters it's none of their business. But you can tell them you're running a wikiHow experiment. Results inconclusive, but you'll keep them posted when you know.",
                "Whip up a home remedy. If you're out of creams in your mom's medicine cabinet and out of gas in your car, search the kitchen for other possible alternatives. Razor bumps have been around for ages and there are treatments to prove it.\n\n\nMake a \"mask\" out of pureed cucumber and milk (1:2 ratio). Apply it to the area for 10-20 minutes and then rinse it off. The redness should be greatly reduced.[4]\n\nDouse the bumps in cornstarch and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse off thoroughly. It should dry up the redness and shrink the bumps.[4]",
                "Open up the Pores: The first step is probably the most important and overlooked step. Opening your pores, enables the special ingredients contained in the Alpha Mane facial cleanser and razor bump cream do their jobs effectively. So how do you open up the pores? Apply a warm face cloth to the affected area. Let sit for about 3-4 minutes or when the cloth becomes cool. Repeat the process, but this time, let sit for about a minute.",
                "Cleanse the Skin: With your pores now open, gently apply the Alpha Mane Green Tea Facial Cleanser in circular motions in an upward direction. Massage into the skin for approximately one to two minutes. Let sit on skin for about a minute. Rinse the Green Tea Facial Cleanser completely off your skin with warm water. Using a soft cloth, gently pat down on the wet area until dry.",
                "Apply Razor Bump Cream: In a circular motion, gently apply the Alpha Mane Razor Bump Cream to the affected area on your skin. Please ensure the cream is completely rubbed into the skin. And voila, you are done. Treat your affected skin in the morning (after you shower) & at night, before bed.",
                "Crush up some asprin with a little bit of water, it'll reduce the itch and swelling of the razor burn. This works because the asprin has small traces of salicylic acid in it."

            "steps": [
                "Use soapy water. Be aware that washing this way can loosen the adhesive of the rubber portion from a wooden block stamp. If that is a concern, use the wipes method instead; alternatively, only wipe, do not dip (and definitely do not soak) the rubber stamps.\n\n\nFill a bowl with warm, soap water. Use a mild soap.\nDip the stamp into the bowl to dampen the rubber portion. Alternatively, dip the cleaning implement in the soapy water, to spare the stamp holding portion from getting wet.\nUse a cleaning cloth to wipe the ink off or scrub with an old toothbrush.\nRepeat until the ink has come off.",
                "Use wipes. Simply wipe the ink off using any suitable wipe, such as a baby wipe, a cleaning wipe or a travel wipe. The wipes are safest when they do not contain alcohol or aloe. To dry, press into a thick layer of paper towel.\n\n\nThis is a good method for using while stamping, in between color changes.\nWipes only work on water/archival based ink; not permanent ink.",
                "Check the condition of your stamp. If it has a lot of dried ink in between the characters or lines, it is harder to read the printed image. If you are unsure just by looking at the stamp, do a test stamp on a piece of scrap paper, then check the document imprint.\n\n\nDried ink that is flat and clean on the stamp is a color stain, not a dirty stamp. It is only if the ink has built up and interferes with your stamping that it's a real problem.",
                "Find a basin with hot, running water.",
                "Let the water run until it gets hot. Hold the stamp by the handle. Run the rubber image under the water until the water runs clear. It's okay to see black, red, or another color of ink while rinsing the stamp.",

        "wikiHow to Treat Pneumonia": {
            "intro": "Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection that affects the lung tissue. Lower respiratory tract infections are the number one cause of infectious disease death in the United States.[1] Treating mild cases of pneumonia will require outpatient care with antibiotics and rest, while moderate cases will need inpatient care with IV antibiotics. Severe cases of pneumonia require inpatient care with IV antibiotics, as well as intubation and mechanical ventilation to assist with respiration. Regardless of the level of severity, pneumonia is a very serious condition and should be treated promptly and completely.",
            "steps": [
                "Take care of mild cases. If you have a mild case of pneumonia, you will be treated as an outpatient. If the patient is a child, she may be admitted to the hospital if the doctor thinks it may get worse. Your doctor will start you on an antibiotic regimen. Your doctor will also suggest rest and increased sleep in order to get better as quickly as possible. Even in mild cases, you should not go to school or work until your doctor says you can. Total recovery is generally seven to 10 days.\n\n\nSome types of pneumonia are highly contagious, while others are only passed to others under optimal conditions.[2] When you are diagnosed, ask your doctor about how contagious your particular pneumonia is, and for how long you will be considered contagious.[3]\n\nYou should see a significant improvement in your symptoms within 48 hours of treatment. This means you should no longer have a fever and have an overall increase in strength.\nThere is no need for special care when cleaning up after a patient with pneumonia. The germs that cause it are not viable on inanimate objects for any substantial time frame and will be removed with normal washing.[4]",
                "Deal with moderate cases. Moderate cases of pneumonia are those with significant respiratory compromise and require supplemental oxygen to keep their oxygen saturation up. These patients will also have fever and overall sickly appearance. If this is how your pneumonia manifests, you will likely be admitted to inpatient wards to receive intravenous antibiotics. The kind of antibiotics you get will not change, they will just be in IV form in order to get the drugs into your system faster.\n\n\nYou will be changed to oral antibiotics as your fever breaks and you become responsive to therapy. This typically takes no more than 48 hours.\nThe treatment from here follows the same for mild cases, because the case has transitioned from moderate to mild.[5]",
                "Seek help for severe cases. Severe cases of pneumonia are those with patients who are going through respiratory failure. This requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. It may also require being admitted to the intensive care unit.[6][7]\n\nLike with moderate cases, IV antibiotics are required. These cases often require vasopressor support with pressors (medications which raise your blood pressure) to counter the effects of septic shock.\nWhile in the hospital, you will need supportive care to improve your general health while the medications do their work. Once you improve, you will follow the care for moderate and then mild cases as you get better. The length of your hospital stay will depend on the severity of the damage to your lungs and how bad your case of pneumonia was.[8]\n\nYour doctor may utilize bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in select patients to prevent intubation and traditional mechanical ventilation.[9] BiPAP is a non-invasive way to deliver pressurized air to a patient, often used to treat sleep apnea.[10]",
                "Take the right antibiotics. There are a few different antibiotics that you can take if you get pneumonia. Your doctor will determine which kind of pathogen caused your pneumonia, which will then determine which medicine you take. For the most common forms of pneumonia, antibiotics such as zithromax or doxycycline are combined with amoxicillin, augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, or cefotaxime. The dosage will depend on the age and severity of your case, as well as your allergies and the culture results.\n\n\nYou doctor may prescribe the less common but effective single antibiotic therapy route, which is a respiratory quinolone such as Levaquin or Avelox for adults.[11] Quinolones not indicated for pediatric populations.\nIn moderate cases and mild cases on the verge of hospitalization, your doctor may give you a rocephin IV followed with the oral regimen.\nIn all these cases, your doctor will follow up within a few days to see how your symptoms are progressing.[12]",
                "Treat hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Patients that get HAP are already dealing with health issues. This makes their treatment a little different than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), though these methods may be used in rare and severe cases of CAP. HAP can be caused by many different types of pathogens, so your doctor will determine which kind you have and then administer the antibiotics according to the pathogen infecting your. The common treatments are:\n\n\nFor Klebsiella and E Coli, IV antibiotics such as quinolone, ceftazidime, or ceftriaxone\nFor Pseudomonas, IV antibiotics and imipenem, piperacillin, or cefepime\nFor Staph Aureus or MRSA, IV antibiotics such as vancomycin\nFor fungal pneumonias, IV antibiotics such as Amphotericin B or Diflucan IV\nFor vancomycin resistant enterococcus: IV antibiotics of Ceftaroline[13]",
                "Take the flu shot. Pneumonia can be caused when influenza is contracted and becomes advanced. Because of this, it is recommended that you get the flu shot every year. Since this helps fight against the flu, it will help fight against pneumonia as well.\n\n\nThe flu shot can be taken by anyone over the age of six months.\nThere is a special vaccine that can be taken by children younger than two and also one for those two to five years old who are at increased risk of pneumonia. Children who go to communal day care should also get the vaccine.[14]\n\nThere is also a vaccine for those without spleens, over the age of 65, with lung disease such as asthma and COPD, and with sickle cell anemia.",
                "Wash your hands often. If you want to avoid getting pneumonia, you need to avoid coming into contact with the viruses and germs that cause it. You can do this through proper hand washing. If you are in public or around someone you know is sick, you should wash your hands as much as possible. Also avoid putting your unclean hands near your face in order to prevent the spread of unwashed germs from your hands to your system. To wash your hands properly, you need to:\n\n\nTurn on the faucet and wet your hands.\nApply soap to your hands and scrub every part of your finger. This includes under the nails, on the backs of your hands, and between your fingers.\nKeep rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds, which is how long it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song all the way through twice.\nRinse your hands in the water to rinse off the soap. Make sure the water is warm to help remove the soap and germs.\nDry them off with a clean towel.[15]",
                "Take care of yourself. A great way to prevent contracting pneumonia is to be in the best overall health you can be. This means you need to stay in shape physically and mentally. Try to exercise every day, eat a healthy and well-balanced diet, and get enough sleep. These things all benefit your health and will keep your immune system in the best shape it can be, which will help you stay as healthy as possible.\n\n\nMany people think they can skimp off sleep and still be healthy. Studies have been done that link the wellbeing of your immune system to the amount of sleep you get each night. The more high-quality sleep, which is uninterrupted sleep in a sleep-conducive environment, you get a night, the healthier your immune system will be.[16]",
                "Try vitamins and minerals. There are some supplements that you can take to boost your overall immune health. One of the best to help pneumonia is Vitamin C. Take between 1000 to 2000 mg every day. You can get this from citrus fruit, citrus juice, broccoli, watermelon, cantaloupe, and many other fruits and vegetables.[17]\n\nZinc is helpful if you feel like you are getting a cold, which can turn into pneumonia. At the first sign of symptoms, take 150 mg of zinc three times a day.[18]",
                "Get a pneumonia vaccine if you have a weak immune system. While getting a flu shot is useful for nearly everyone, pneumonia vaccines are only really necessary for some. If you're a healthy adult between the ages of 18 and 64, you probably don't need to worry about getting vaccinated.[19] However, consider getting vaccinated if you are over 65, have a disease that makes your immune system weak, smoke or drink heavily, or are recovering from a major illness, injury, or surgery.\n\nThe two types of pneumonia vaccines are: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or Prevnar 13) which protects against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria and The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 or Pneumovax) which protects against 23.[20]\n\nGetting a pneumonia vaccine doesn't guarantee that you won't get pneumonia, but it drastically lowers your chances. If you do get pneumonia after taking a pneumonia vaccine, it'll most likely be a mild case.[21]",
                "Learn the types. Pneumonia is divided into two broad types that are caused by different things and are treated differently — community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which will be discussed later. CAP consists pneumonia caused by typical bacteria, atypical bacteria, and respiratory viruses.\n\n\nCAP is the kind of pneumonia most people contract in their daily lives. CAP is more dangerous in the elderly, the very young, and those with a compromised immune system, such as those with diabetes, with HIV, on chemotherapy, and taking steroid medications. CAP can range from a mild case treated at home to a case with acute respiratory failure and death.[22]",
                "Recognize the symptoms of pneumonia. The symptoms of pneumonia can vary from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the pneumonia and how badly the patient is infected. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor immediately to get treated. The longer you wait, the worse you can get. Symptoms of CAP include:[23]\n\nA productive cough\nMucus with a thick texture, which may be green, yellow, or red tinged\nSevere chest pain when a deep breath is taken\nFever greater than 100.4°F (38°C), but often 101 to 102°F (38.3 to 38.9°C)\nChills or involuntary shaking\nShortness of breath, which can be mild to severe\nRapid breathing, which is more common in child cases\nDrop in oxygen saturation in the lungs",
                "Diagnose CAP. When you see your doctor, they will check for all the common symptoms. In addition to this, he or she will also take a chest radiograph, which will show how your lungs are affected. If your doctor see an area of white patchy consolidation on a lobe of the lung, which should usually be black, you likely have pneumonia. There may be a parapneumonic effusion, or collection of fluid, adjacent to the area of infection.\n\n\nBlood tests are not typically needed in mild cases of pneumonia. However, if your case is more advanced, your doctor may take labs such as a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a mucus specimen, and cultures. [24]",
                "Seek immediate medical attention. There are certain circumstances in which you may need to see immediate medical care. Even if you have been treated, you should seek immediate medical help if your symptoms get worse. Get to a doctor or emergency room as soon as possible if:[25]\n\nYou become confused about time, people or places\nYour nausea and vomiting prevent you from keeping down oral antibiotics\nYour blood pressure drops\nYour breathing is rapid\nYou need breathing assistance\nYour temperature is higher than 102°F (38.9°C)\nYour temperature is below normal",
                "Know about hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). HAP occurs in patients who contract pneumonia while hospitalized. HAP refers to pneumonia that patients acquire while in the hospital. This strain is typically very severe and is accompanied by high death rates. It accounts for up to 2% of all rehospitalizations. It happens to all kinds of hospital patients, from those who are getting surgery to those who had a fall to those already with a serious infection. Hospital acquired pneumonia can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure, and death.[26]\n\nThe symptoms of hospital acquired pneumonia are the same, since they are both types of the same disease.",
                "Recognize the risks of hospital acquired pneumonia. Community acquired pneumonia is spread through the transmission of common pathogens. Hospital acquired pneumonia, however, is spread within a hospital. There are some patients that are more at risk than others based on their condition, though anyone in a hospital can contract HAP. These risk factors include:[27]\n\nBeing in the ICU\nBeing on a mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more\nStaying at the hospital or ICU for an extended time\nThose with severe issues with their underlying issues when they were originally hospitalized\nThose with heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, COPD, and diabetes",
                "Learn the causes of hospital acquired pneumonia. Hospital acquired pneumonia can occur through complications after surgery, such as a post surgery collapsed lung or from not taking enough deep breaths due to pain. It can also occur due to poor hygiene from the medical staff at the hospital, especially while caring for patients with central lines, those one ventilator care, and those having a breathing tube placed or replaced.[28]",
                "Avoid hospital-acquired pneumonia. HAP can be avoided through excellent hygiene amongst healthcare providers, meticulous ventilator care, and post-operative use of incentive spirometers, which are devices that encourage deep breathing among post surgical patients. It can also be avoided if a person gets out of bed faster after surgery and if any intubations are removed as soon as possible. [29]"

        "How to Remove Bees": {
            "intro": "Spring is in the air...and so are swarms of bees, looking for new homes. Despite their benefit for the environment, most folks don't want a hive of honey bees in close proximity to their homes (even if they are minding their own beeswax!) So start with Step 1 below to find out what to do with the little pollinators if they decide to take up residence on your property.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand what you're dealing with. Before you take any action, it's important to make sure that it is definitely bees you're dealing with, and not wasps or hornets. Bees are valuable pollinators and are not aggressive or dangerous (unless someone in your family has an allergy), so killing them should be avoided if possible.\n\n\nYou can identify bees by examining their appearance (this is easiest if you can find a dead bee). Look for hairs on the body - all bees have hairs, whereas wasps tend to have smooth exteriors.\nAlso try to get a look at the nest. Honey bees build their nests out of wax, in a honeycomb formation, whereas other stinging insects tend to construct their nests out of wood fiber or mud.\nHoney bees tend to be most active in spring, when they are collecting pollen. Watch for signs of them flying back and forth from the nest.",
                "Call a local beekeeper. If you have confirmed the presence of honey bees and have identified the location of their nest (they prefer enclosed spaces like wall cavities, roofs and chimneys), your first step should be to call a local beekeeper. Not only will they be happy to remove the bees but you could also be saving an endangered species. Honey bees are disappearing rapidly, and without them to pollinate, every plant on Earth may be affected negatively.\n\n\nBeekeepers will often physically remove both the bees and their hive, without needing to exterminate them. They may do this for free or they may charge a fee, depending on the location of the nest and the effort involved in removing them. In some places, they might even pay you.\nThe beekeeper will usually cut out the honeycombs with the brood inside and place them in frames, which the beekeeper can later transfer to his/her own hive box.\nHowever, if the nest is difficult to reach, the beekeeper may use a special vacuum to suck up the bees without killing them.\nIf the nest is behind a wall, you may need to call a contractor to knock down a portion of the wall to give the beekeeper access to the bees. As the homeowner, you will need to cover the cost of this, and any repairs that follow.\nThe bees are likely to become agitated as the beekeeper is doing his/her job. Therefore it's recommended that you keep your family, especially any children or pets, inside until the job is complete. The beekeeper will be protected by their beekeeping suit.[1]",
                "Call an exterminator. In some circumstances, local beekeepers will be unwilling or unable to remove the nest. They may not have room for the bees, or the effort required in removing the bees may not be worth their time. If this is the case, you will need to call a professional exterminator, who will generally kill the bees before removing them.\n\n\nExterminating bees can be a difficult job and might involve a hefty fee. The exterminator will usually use a pesticide to kill the bees. However, it is important to be aware that this will usually only kill the bees near the surface of the nest, and new pupa will emerge within a couple of days, so you will need the exterminators to return two or three times over the next couple of weeks in order to completely remove the bees.\nNormally, the exterminators will only kill the bees, they will not remove the dead bees or the nest. Rather than just sealing up the wall cavity, it is very important to completely remove any traces of the nest, otherwise the bees and the honey from the combs could start to rot, producing a very bad smell and potentially damaging the drywall.\nRemember that the dead bees, the honey and the nest have all been treated with pesticides, so you will need to handle them as hazardous waste when disposing of them. Then you will need to thoroughly clean the area with warm soapy water, and repaint if necessary.",
                "Trap the bees outside. Another option for removing the bees without killing them is to trap them outside the nest. However, this is a time-consuming process, so it should only be undertaken by homeowners who are not in a rush to get rid of the bees.\n\n\nTo trap the bees, you will need an exit cone made from screen wire. The wide end of the cone should be secured over the entrance to the hive, while the narrow end should have an exit hole with a diameter no larger than 3/8\". This allows the bees to exit the cone, but prevents them from getting back in.\nFor this method to work, it is imperative that you seal up all other entrances (such as holes and cracks) leading to the hive, otherwise the bees will simply find another way in.\nTo ensure that the trapped bees survive, you will need to put a second, small hive (provided by a beekeeper) as close to the exit cone as possible. This small hive is known as a \"nuc\" and contains a new queen, some honey and a small number of worker bees. When the trapped bees find that they can no longer return to their original nest, they will join this new nest instead.\nDepending on the size of the original hive, it may take up to two months for the majority of bees to exit. The original queen will not abandon her brood, so you will need to inject some pesticide into the wall to kill her and any remaining bees. [2]",
                "Use pesticides. If you aren't able to enlist the help of a beekeeper and don't want to pay an exterminator, you can get rid of the bees yourself using pesticides.\n\n\nFind an aerosol pesticide containing pyrethroids. Don't worry if it's intended for wasps and hornets -- it will work just as well on bees, killing them upon contact.\nCover yourself up in protective clothing and spray the pesticide into the hive (following the label's instructions), from any available access points. Do this in the late evening, when the bees are less active.\nKeep in mind that the pesticide will only kill the bees it comes in direct contact with, so it won't have any effect on the developing pupa which have yet to hatch. Therefore, you will need to repeat the spraying process two or three weeks later to ensure that the newly hatched bees are also exterminated.\nIf you don't want to use an aerosol, you could also use a motor blower to blow an insecticidal dust like Sevin into the hive. The dust will not kill the bees immediately, but the worker bees will track the dust into the center of the hive, eventually killing off the entire hive.[3]",
                "Clean up afterwards. Once the bees have been removed, it is very important that you remove the hive and clean up any honey or dead bees before sealing the area.\n\n\nIf the honey and dead bees are not removed, they can start to rot or ferment causing a very bad odor that may fill your home. The unattended honey may also seep through drywall, causing a lot of damage to your home.\nIn addition, the smell of old honey and wax can attract new swarms to set up their hive in the same location, so it's important to remove the old one and seal off the area in order to avoid going through the whole bee removal process again the following year.\nIn order to remove a large hive, you may need to tear down a wall -- this is a pain, but remember that the cost of fixing the wall is less than the potential cost of replacing damaged drywall. Clean up the old hive, then paint over the area.\nThe final step is to fill in the cavity (expandable foam insulation is recommended) and seal up any holes or cracks in the wall where the bees could potentially reenter. It's also advisable to inspect the area periodically throughout the year, to make sure all of the entrances remain sealed.[4]",
                "Wait it out. If the bees have set up residence in a tree, fence or other location somewhere near your houses, you should consider just leaving it alone and allowing bee season to pass.\n\n\nBees are not typically very aggressive (unless they feel under threat) so if you leave them alone to go about their business, you shouldn't have any problems.\nWhen the cold winter weather sets in, the worker bees will dies and the new queens will leave. Then you can safely remove the nest.[5]\n\nOf course, this is only possible if the bees are not interfering with your use of the garden and if no one in your family has a bee allergy.",
                "Call a beekeeper. If you can find a local beekeeper who is willing to help you with your bee problem, they may be able to save most of the bees by transferring them to a hive box. This can be done in several ways:\n\n\nIf the hive is easily accessible, the beekeeper will be able to simply cut out the comb containing the brood and bees and place it directly into a hive box.\nAlternatively, if the hive is trapped in a section of tree or fence, a hive body can be placed over the entrance and the bees will crawl into it by themselves.\nFinally, if the hive is in a difficult to reach the spot, the beekeeper may place an exit cone (like the one described in the section above) over the entrance to the hive. This will trap the worker bees outside. A hive body will then be hung in a nearby location, which the trapped-out bees will eventually join.",
                "Relocate them. If the bees have set up their hive inside a tree, one possible option is just to relocate them by carefully cutting out the tree section containing the bees and placing it in a secluded location, away from your house.\n\n\nIf you decide to go down this route, you should do so as early in the year as possible, before the number of bees significantly increases.\nMake sure to cover yourself up fully in protective clothing, as the bees will probably become aggravated by the sawing or chopping near their hive.\nChoose the new location of the hive carefully -- don't place it on somebody else's land without their permission, and don't put it anywhere that someone might accidentally stumble across it.[3]",
                "Use pesticides. If you do not have the time or resources to remove the bees or relocate them, you may have no choice but to exterminate them. This can easily be achieved using aerosol or spray pesticides.\n\n\nSpray the aerosol or sprinkle the insecticide dust into the entrance to the hive. Do this late in the evening when the bees are least active, while wearing protective clothing.\nYou will need to repeat this process once or twice more over the coming weeks, as the hive's pupa are protected by a layer of wax so you will need to wait until they hatch before you can kill them with the pesticide.",
                "Use dish soap and water. If you are opposed to the use of pesticides but still want to kill off the bees, you can attempt to do so using a solution of soap and water. The soapy water is able to penetrate the bees protective waxy surface, essentially drowning the bees.\n\n\nMix a solution of one part dish soap and four parts water and pour it into a spray bottle. Cover yourself head to toe in protective clothing (as the water will not kill the bees immediately and they will probably become agitated) and begin to spray the soapy water into the hive and at any visible bees.\nThe soapy water will only kill the bees it comes in direct contact with, so you will need to repeat the process several times over to target as many bees as possible.[6]",
                "Seal up holes in exterior walls. The best way to prevent bees from setting up inside the walls of your home is to prevent them from entering in the first place. You can do this by inspecting your exterior wall for any holes or cracks that are large enough to insert a pencil through, then sealing them up with caulk.[4]",
                "Fill wall cavities. You should also fill up any wall cavities -- this way, even if the bees manage to get in, they won't have space to set up a hive. The best way to fill in wall cavities quickly and easily is to use expandable foam.",
                "Remove any traces of honey or beeswax. As mentioned before, bees are attracted to sites where other bees have previously set up their hives, as they can smell traces of honey or beeswax.\n\n\nTherefore, it's important to remove these substances completely after you've got rid of the hive.\nIf the hive was outdoors, you could use a power hose, if it was indoors, you could use strong cleaning products and possibly paint over the area afterwards.",
                "Use natural bee repellents. Another simple way to prevent a future bee infestation is to use natural bee repellents to deter them from building a hive near your home. Try one of the following:\n\n\n\nCitronella: The scent of citronella is believed to ward off bees and wasps. You can take advantage of this fact by growing citronella plants in your garden, or by burning citronella candles or incense outdoors during bee season.\n\nCucumber peels: The peelings from a cucumber are also believed to naturally repel bees. Simply sprinkle the cucumber peels over your lawn and any flower beds. This will deter the bees while also helping to fertilize your garden!\n\nSugar water: An alternative technique is to dissolve a couple of tablespoons of sugar in a basin of water and leave it out in your garden. The bees will be attracted to the sweet scent of the water (thinking it's honey) and end up drowning in the water. It also helps if you add a little dish soap to the water, as this breaks down the wax covering the bee's body and makes it drown faster.[7]"

                "Update your usual costume for warmth. Consider what you might be able to add to the costume without detracting from it. What would the character wear in cold weather? For example, an elf or a superhero might don a cloak, a fairy might wear longer sleeves or an animal might have grown a thicker fur coat for the colder season.\n\n\nAdd a cloak or cape in place of a jacket for a more elegant addition to the costume. If the costume's own cape is only thin, swap it out for a wool or polar fleece version.\nAdd tights, leggings or pantyhose for warm legs. These are often a very easy way to increase leg warmth without ruining a costume. Match the colors either to your legs (skin-colored) or to the costume.\nWear a skin-colored unitard. If your costume is skimpy and requires showing some skin, a unitard can keep you warm while still giving the appearance of skin. Check for it at dance supply stores. Simply wear it under your costume.\nWear a turtleneck sweater under the costume. This will add warmth to all of your upper body region, which helps best for keeping you warm.\nWear gloves or mittens. Match the color of the costume or choose skin-colored gloves or mittens.\nWear socks in a color that matches the costume, or simply ones that fit inside your shoes, enough to keep your feet warm.",
                "Wear a wig. A wig can both improve the look of the costume and keep your head and ears warm.",
                "Add a mask. A mask will help to keep your face warm and you won't have to bother with adding makeup either.",
                "Make use of thermals or fine merino layers under the costume. Slimline merino tops and pants or thermals can be placed underneath a costume to keep you warm. Choose the lengths of the sleeves and legs according to the costume; there are thermal shorts as well as short- or long-sleeved thermals.",
                "Bring a jacket along anyway. Regardless of what it looks like when you wear it, having it ready for when you really start to feel cold will allow you to stay out for longer and keep warm.\n\n\nYou could even wear the jacket between houses, then take it off when trick and treating, and pop it back on again when off to the next house.",
                "Carry a thermos flask with hot chocolate or warm apple cider inside. Have a hot sip now and then.\n\n\nBe sure it is at a temperature suitable for safe sipping.",
                "Carry hand warmers. You can purchase hand warmers at drugstore. They are usually snapped or bent to make them work; just follow the instructions. Keep them tucked in the pockets of your jacket or carry them in a bag and use them now and then to warm up your hands again.",
                "Bring along a blanket. Wrap it around you whenever you feel coldest, for a quick warm up. By the end of the evening, you will probably find wearing it like a cape is preferable to freezing anyway.",
                "Keep moving. Walk briskly and do exercise. Keep up a cracking pace as you trick and treat, to increase your warmth. Try a few jumping jacks, lunges or other on-the-spot exercises to help you warm up. Constant movement should help to keep you warmer.\n\n\nYour costume might not be suitable for jumping or doing strenuous exercise in; be cautious in case you rip or spoil it.",
                "Take the car. Ask your parents to drive you around the different streets. Hop back in the car now and then to get a blast from the heater before you head off for a few more house visits.",
                "Stay indoors. Have a fun indoor party for Halloween rather than going outside door-to-door.",
                "Choose a costume that's both fun and warm. Here are some ideas for costumes that may be warmer to wear:\n\n\nMummy\nMedieval clothes\nFull length dress - queen, princess, bride, etc.\nGhost - one white bed sheet with eye holes and all your normal clothes on underneath\nClown\nAn object such as a cell phone, a Rubik's cube or a Lego block - one box with sweater and jumper\nAny furry animal\nFruit or vegetable - food item for your body, with sweater and tights of the same color underneath\nCare bears\nZombies in everyday clothes - just toss fake blood all over some warm thrift store clothes and add zombie makeup to your face\nSanta or the Easter bunny\nEthnic costumes - many of these are modest, so they're ideal for keeping warm too\nGnome, dwarf or any other fantasy creature that always wears long sleeves and pants and a beard to go with it\nThe Michelin man\nAny character that has ever worn a puffy jacket or vest (Marty McFly), a big warm coat (Dr. Who), or other really warm gear (check out your favorite snow and ice movies)."

        "How to Select an Estate Planning Attorney": {
            "intro": "Planning your estate involves deciding what will happen to your personal property and real estate after you die. The law provides a default scheme for disposing of property, but relying on that involves a lengthy court process and potentially hefty tax consequences for your heirs. The alternative is to plan things out ahead of time through documents such as wills and trusts. Because this area of law is impacted by so many variables and factors you may fail to consider, hiring an attorney to help you is a good idea, even if you have a relatively simple estate. Be prepared to invest significant time and effort to find the right legal professional.",
            "steps": [
                "Decide whether you need an attorney. If you own very little real estate or personal property, you may be able to use a document kit and plan your estate on your own. However, if you own real estate, have retirement or investment accounts, or own your own business, you should seek professional legal assistance.\n\n\nIf money is an issue, it may be possible for you to find an attorney who is willing to consult with you on a few limited issues, or to review documents you've drafted yourself.\nIf you decide to consult an attorney, compile documents and information about your property and assets, and think about what is likely to happen in the coming years, how much your property would potentially be worth, and who you want to have ownership or control over it.\nThe types and quantity of assets you have will in part determine both what kind of attorney you should look for and how much that attorney will charge you to draft a plan for your estate.",
                "Ask family and friends for recommendations. Your friends and family are a good place to start because they know you and can anticipate who you would personally like.\n\n\nAt the same time, be wary of possible ulterior motives, especially if you have a relatively large estate and the person you're asking for a recommendation stands to gain or believes she'll be listed as an heir. Always carefully vet an attorney before hiring him, even if he was recommended by a close friend or relative.\nYou may have an attorney you use for other matters. If so, ask her if she knows an estate-planning attorney she could recommend. An attorney would have a good understanding of another attorney's status, experience, and professional reputation.[1]",
                "Visit your state or local bar association's website. Bar associations have lists of their members, and often allow you to search by specialty or area of practice.\n\n\nState bar associations often offer a lawyer referral service that enables you to meet briefly with a pre-screened attorney after answering a few general questions about your needs. This initial consultation typically is cheaper than what attorneys would charge if you didn't use the referral service.",
                "Search for attorneys who are board certified specialists. Some states allow attorneys to become certified specialists in a particular area of law, such as trusts and estates. If professional certification is available in your state, the bar association will have information on it.\n\n\nBefore applying for certification, an attorney must have a certain number of years of experience practicing law in the area, usually at least five.\nTo become certified, an attorney must submit a number of professional references, take additional courses in that area of law, and pass a lengthy written exam.",
                "Look at membership listings for professional groups of estate planners. The best attorneys often are members of professional societies or other groups, where they can share knowledge and experience with other estate planners.\n\n\nOne example is the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel. Its members frequently publish articles and present topics at continuing legal education seminars, so if you find an attorney listed as a member you can be more confident that she is an estate planning expert.[2]\n\nYou also can search the member directory of the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys.",
                "Visit websites of attorneys and law firms. Once you have the names of some attorneys or firms you're interested in pursuing, check out their website to research further into their background and practice.\n\n\nKeep in mind that an attorney's website is also a marketing tool. You are seeing what he wants you to see, so the things he chooses to emphasize or promote on his website give you a good idea of his interests and his professional comfort zone.\nLook at any background or biographical information the attorney has listed. You not only want to review this for experience and education in estate planning, you also want to see if the attorney seems like someone you can relate to. For example, maybe you have a beagle, and you notice on one attorney's bio page that he says he breeds beagles. Since your estate planner will likely be in your life for a long time, it can be important to have common interests.[3]\n\nPay attention to the attorney's social media presence. If she has active social media accounts that are updated regularly, or runs a blog where she regularly posts about new developments in the law, you can be assured that she is responsive to her clients and keeps up-to-date on important issues in her practice area.[4]",
                "Check the bar records of attorneys you're interested in interviewing. Before you schedule any interviews, go back to the bar association's website and look up each attorney's name.\n\n\nYou want to make sure all attorneys you interview are licensed and in good standing. If any of your prospects have significant complaints or professional disciplinary action on their record, remove them from your list.",
                "Have a preliminary phone consultation. Many attorneys will hold a brief interview with you over the phone. Since these take up less time and require less effort than in-person consultations, you can talk to more attorneys this way and use the phone interviews to narrow your list of possible contenders.",
                "Make appointments to meet in person. You'll want to interview at least three attorneys in their offices.\n\n\nFind out if the attorney offers a free or low-cost initial consultation before you schedule the interview. You don't want to get caught unawares when handed a large bill.[5]\n\nEven if the initial consultation is free, the attorney may have a time limit set. Find out how long a free consultation lasts and what the attorney will charge if you go over that time.",
                "Gather all necessary documents and information. Before your appointment, the attorney or her assistant may give you a list of information they need to evaluate your case.\n\n\nA thorough attorney may also provide you with questionnaires or goal forms she expects you to fill out and send back before the interview. Make sure you return that information with plenty of time for her to review your answers so your interview will be as productive as possible.[6]",
                "Ask each attorney questions about their practice. You want to make sure you select an estate planning attorney who not only has the appropriate amount of experience and expertise, but also is competent to work with you and handle your estate well into the future.\n\n\nHow much expertise you need depends on your particular situation. If you have a fairly simple estate, you may be able to save money by hiring someone who only has a few years of experience.\nHowever, if you have a complex estate, for example you own multiple investment accounts or have real estate in several states or overseas, you not only need an attorney with more experience, but with specific experience handling estates similar to yours.[7]\n\nYou also want to find out how much of the attorney's practice consists of estate planning and how much is devoted to other work. While an attorney may excel in a number of different practice areas, your best estate planners typically work in that realm exclusively.[8]\n\nAsk the attorney how much of the work on your case he'll be doing himself and how much will be delegated to beginning attorneys or other staff. If you have a simple estate, you can save some preparation costs if the bulk of the work is done by a paralegal or an inexperienced attorney under the supervision of someone more experienced. However, if you have complex property matters you want to make sure the person handling them has the necessary expertise.[9]",
                "Find out if the attorney has malpractice or professional liability insurance.[10] Not all states require attorneys to carry liability insurance, nor do all states require attorneys to disclose whether they have it or not.[11]\n\nYou should think twice about hiring an attorney to plan your estate if he does not have liability insurance. If he or someone working for him makes a mistake, it could be incredibly costly and might be impossible to undo or reverse. Without liability insurance, you and your heirs could lose everything.[12]",
                "Ask each attorney specific questions about your estate and your estate planning options. Any attorney you choose should be comfortable answering your questions and display a strong working understanding of the law.\n\n\nThe best attorney also will be able to explain the law, and your options under the law, in a way that you understand. It's worthless to pay for documents if you don't understand what they mean or what they do.[13]",
                "Observe each attorney's behavior and demeanor. Not only are you going to be working with this person potentially for the rest of your life, but you also need to be able to trust them with extremely private and personal details of your life.\n\n\nTo help you effectively, the attorney should be actively interested in what you're saying. She should ask you plenty of questions as well, about what your goals are with your estate and how you want to accomplish them.\nIf the attorney is distracted or attends to other clients or practice matters while talking to you, she may not be focused enough on meeting your needs, or willing to come up with a unique custom solution for you if your circumstances require one.[14]\n\nWhoever you choose will have to ask you some very personal and potentially uncomfortable questions so she can understand your needs, your life situation, and your relationships with your family and friends. It's imperative that you are comfortable with the attorney.\nIn this way, interviewing an estate planner is almost like going out on a date. You want to feel warm, friendly and open with the attorney you choose. If the relationship feels stiff and awkward, that attorney is not the one for you.[15]",
                "Make sure you understand how the attorney charges and exactly what is included in the fee. Some attorneys charge different rates for different types of services, while others offer flat-fee or bundled service packages.\n\n\nFlat fee packages typically center around the drafting and finalization of particular documents. For example, the attorney may draft a will for $500. If you need other services in addition to will drafting, the same attorney may be happy to take those tasks on as well, but will charge you extra for them.\nThe more consultations and face-to-face meetings are included, the more expensive the service will be.\nMany factors will affect the cost of your estate plans, including the experience of the attorney, the type and amount of assets you have, and the complexity of any tax planning. Each attorney should be able to explain clearly how costs are assessed and how rates are computed.[16]\n\nAfter the initial consultation, an experienced estate-planning attorney should have a good idea of how much work your estate will entail. However, in most cases she needs to have that initial consultation first so she understands the various aspects of your case at least on a basic level.[17]",
                "Take notes during and after the interview. Attorneys are used to people writing while they're talking, so don't think you'll be considered rude if you take notes during the interview. After the interview, write down your general impressions and feelings while the experience is still fresh in your memory.",
                "Ask the attorney for references. Since attorneys have a duty of confidentiality to all clients, even former ones, they cannot disclose names without having first obtained permission.[18]\n\nHowever, estate-planning attorneys often have former clients provide a reference, which they publish on their website or make available to potential clients on request.",
                "Compare the attorneys you interviewed. If necessary, make a list of pros and cons for each so you can figure out which would be the best for you, considering all aspects of the representation and the potential relationship.\n\n\nUnderstand that cost is not your only concern, nor should it be your primary concern. You're dealing with the distribution of everything you've earned and accumulated over your entire life, so it's worth the investment to make sure it's done right.",
                "Follow up with your prospects if you have additional questions. As you prepare to make your final decision, you may realize you didn't get all the information you needed at the interview. If that's the case, you shouldn't hesitate to call or email with follow-up questions so you can make a fully informed decision.",
                "Consider interviewing other attorneys. If none of the prospects you interviewed feels completely like the right choice, you might want to go back to your long list and interview a few more attorneys until you find one you feel more comfortable with.",
                "Let your prospects know your decision as quickly as possible. Once you've made your decision one way or the other, let that attorney know rather than leaving her hanging.\n\n\nEven if you haven't decided who you want to hire, if there are attorneys you've interviewed who you definitely don't want to hire, go ahead and let them know.",
                "Get the final details of the representation in writing. Before you pay your attorney any money, make sure you know exactly what she's going to do for you, how long it will take, and what documents she will draft.\n\n\nYou also should make sure you understand the extra fees for any additional services that might come up while the attorney is working for you. Make sure there's a system in place for notifying you in advance if extra work must be done or if an issue pops up that needs to be dealt with but is outside the initial scope of the attorney's representation. For example, if you have no children when you initially consult with an estate planning attorney, find out what will happen if you have a son and need to incorporate him into your will or make arrangements for a guardian if you die before he turns 18.",
                "Sign the agreement and pay the retainer or other fee. The written agreement should be signed both by you and your attorney. If you are expected to pay a retainer or other up-front fee for her services, she'll expect payment when the agreement is signed.\n\n\nIf a retainer is required, make sure you know how much will be returned to you if you decide to go with someone else or abandon your plan before the attorney has finished his work.[19]"

        "How to Relieve Menstrual Back Pain": {
            "intro": "Many women experience dysmenorrhea, or cramping, during their menstrual cycle.[1] The cramping occurs when the uterus contracts against nearby blood vessels and your muscles momentarily lose their oxygen supply.[2] Cramping can also occur because a hormone called prostaglandin being released. It is normal for women to experience increased back pain during their cycles, although it may become less pronounced with age or even after pregnancy.[3] There are a number of different ways you can reduce dysmenorrhea.",
            "steps": [
                "Go for a walk. Going for an easy walk not only can stretch out your muscles through motion and help you relax, but it may also ease cramps. Make sure to keep your walk low impact so that you don’t cause your muscles to tense up further.\n\n\nOnly walk if you are able to and don’t push yourself. This may only be possible after some light stretching.\nGentle walking can help stretch out your muscles. Swing your arms lightly and use long strides to get the full stretching benefits.[4]",
                "Do some gentle yoga. Gentle yoga can help stretch out your cramped back muscles more generally relax you. Even taking the time to do downward facing dog for ten breaths can help ease muscle cramps.\n\n\nTry doing gentle forms of yoga to stretch your muscles and relax you. Types of yoga such as restorative and yin yoga help stretch out and repair muscles and relax the body.[5]\n\nIf you don’t have the time to commit to a full yoga session, do downward facing dog for 10 deeps inhalations and exhalations. Adho mukha savasana, which is the Sanskrit name for downward facing dog, is an important foundational pose in yoga that will not only loosen tight muscles, but will also relax your mind.[6]\n\nTalk to your doctor before you begin any yoga practice to make sure you’re healthy enough to practice.[7]",
                "Practice taking deep breaths. Deep breathing, sometimes called pranayama, will naturally invigorate you and can help dissolve tension and tightness in your back muscles and uterus.[8] Focusing on your breathing can deepen help you deal with the symptoms of menstrual pain quickly and effectively.\n\n\nDeep breathing can help your body distribute oxygen to your body, which can help ease cramps and back pain. Inhale and exhale completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for 4 breaths, hold for 2 counts, and then exhale completely for four breaths. You can vary the counts according to your abilities.[9]\n\nYou want to get the most out of your deep breathing, so sit upright, with your shoulders back, and refrain from slouching. Breath slowly and evenly by focusing from your stomach, pulling in your belly to expand you lungs and rib cage.[10]",
                "Stretch out your back. If you have pain in your back, stretch out your lower back muscles. There are a couple of different ways to stretch that may help alleviate the cramps and pain.\n\n\nLie flat on the ground and bend your knees into your chest to stretch out your lower back muscles.\nIf you cannot lie down, you can do a similar stretch to ease lower back pain by simply bending forward and touching your toes.[11]\n\nDon't force yourself to stretch if it’s not possible. It’s best to gently ease into the stretch. Only increase the stretch as the cramping ceases.\nYou might want to walk around between stretches to help relax yourself.",
                "Get or give yourself a massage. Cramping causes an actual physical change in your back muscles and a massage can remove it so that your muscles feel relaxed.[12] A professional masseuse can feel any cramping or tension in your muscles and massage them out.[13]\n\nSome studies show that massage can release muscle tension and alleviate cramps.[14]\n\nThere are many types of massage available, but Swedish massage and deep-tissue massage are effective at relieving cramps.[15]\n\nYou can locate a qualified massage therapists either online or through a doctor’s recommendation.[16]\n\nIf you can’t get to a professional massage therapist, try self-massage.[17]",
                "Consider acupuncture or acupressure. Some studies found that acupuncture or acupressure can help relieve dysmenorrhea. Schedule a session for yourself with a certified practitioner to help relieve menstrual back pain.[18]\n\nAcupressure can help increase blood flow to your back and uterus, which may alleviate cramping.[19]\n\nAcupressure or acupuncture may help balance out your brain’s hormone regulator, which can relieve pain associated with your period.[20]",
                "Use heat therapy on muscle cramping and pain. Using heat on tense muscles can relax the contracting muscle, but it will also help relieve the pain. There are different kinds of options for heat therapy that include heating pads and rubs to hot water bottles, all of which may help alleviate your discomfort.[21]\n\nFill a hot water bottle or get a heating pad and place it on your back.\nOver the counter heat rubs or patches may also minimize tension and help relax muscle that are spasming. You can purchase these products at most pharmacies.",
                "Take a warm bath. Draw yourself a warm bath when you have back pain. Warm water will soothe cramping and tense muscles. It may also relieve general tension and relax you.[22]\n\nMake sure that the water is between 36 and 40 degrees Celcius so that your skin doesn’t burn. Check the temperatures with a thermometer. [23]\n\nA whirlpool tub can help relieve tension because the jets will massage your back muscles.[24]\n\nEpsom salts can have a sedative effect on you and help relieve muscle pain further.[25]\n\nIf you don’t have a bath, consider using the shower or a steam room.[26]",
                "Make sure you’re hydrated. Studies have not linked dehydration and tension, though there is some evidence that not staying hydrated may contribute to cramping. Drinking enough throughout the day may help you avoid back spasms and tension.[27]\n\nWater is enough to keep you hydrated. If you prefer something with a little flavor, try sports drinks or juices. Just make sure to drink them with water throughout the day.[28]\n\nThere is some evidence that tea, especially red raspberry leaf tea, can help relieve cramps.[29]",
                "Eat sufficient nutrients. Some medical studies have linked low levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium to muscle cramps. Getting enough of these nutrients in your diet may help prevent back cramping and back.[30]\n\nFruits such as bananas and oranges are good sources of potassium.[31]\n\nYou can get magnesium from brown rice, almonds, and avocados.[32]\n\nDairy products such as yogurt and cheese, and dark green vegetables such as spinach are good sources of calcium.[33]",
                "Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Reduce the amount of caffeine you consume and stay away alcohol and tobacco if you can. All three can constrict blood vessels and limiting your intake during your period can alleviate cramping and back pain.[34]\n\nReduce your intake of coffee and caffeinated tea as much as possible.[35]\n\nYou should also reduce your consumption of foods that contain caffeine, such as chocolate.[36]\n\nIf you can, don’t drink alcoholic beverages during your period. They can constrict blood vessels, dehydrate you, and generally make you feel worse.\nAvoid tobacco if you can. If not, try chewing nicotine gum or use an electronic cigarette to minimize how much tobacco you ingest.",
                "Create a comfortable sleeping environment. Sleeping in some positions and having a tightly made bed can increase the frequency of muscle cramps and exacerbate back pain. Loosen your blankets and sheets and sleep on your side to minimize back pain and any cramping you have.\n\n\nConsider sleeping without a flat sheet, which can constrict your movement.[37]\n\nThe best position to help minimize the risk of developing cramps or back pain is on your side with your knees slightly bent.[38]",
                "Take a pain reliever. If you have lingering pain or other methods don’t alleviate your back pain, take an over the counter medication. However, if you experience continued discomfort, consult your doctor.[39]\n\nTake ibuprofen or another type of NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) to help relieve your back pain.[40]\n\nPain relievers are also good for other symptoms of dysmenorrhea such as headaches.[41]",
                "Obtain a birth control pill prescription. Because birth control pills often contain hormones and control a woman’s menstrual cycle, taking them may help alleviate pain associated with your period. Consult with your doctor about taking the pill, which may help to relieve your back pain.[42]\n\nSkipping the placebo, or pill-free, week, may also help manage back pain.[43]\n\nYou need a prescription to get birth control pills, so you’ll need to schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options.",
                "Stay away from quinine. Some sources suggest quinine for cramping and pain. However, medical professionals agree that quinine is dangerous and can cause a numerous health problems such cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, headaches, and tinnitus.[44]"

        "wikiHow to Be More Alert": {
            "intro": "Most of us experience times when we wish we felt more alert. You may be sitting through a meeting worrying how you will ever make it through to the end. You might have to stay alert for a long drive. Perhaps you struggle with insomnia and find it difficult to function during the day. Regardless of the reason, you can feel energized, refreshed, and ready to tackle whatever you need by taking measures to increase your alertness immediately. For a more long-term solution, you can also train yourself to be more alert, exercise to improve alertness, choose the right foods, and make simple lifestyle changes.",
            "steps": [
                "Grab a cup of coffee, but not too much coffee. It’s no surprise that coffee contains caffeine that will help you feel more alert, but overindulging in caffeine can make you feel sluggish and drowsy. To feel more alert without being too jittery or suffering from sleeplessness, restrict your intake to 2 to 3 cups per day.[1][2]\n\nPeople react differently to caffeine, so cut back if you start feeling nervous, experience stomach upset, or think the coffee might be disturbing your sleep.[3]\n\nResearch indicates that up to 400 milligrams of coffee per day, which is equivalent to about 4 cups of coffee, is safe for healthy adults.[4]\n\nWhen you drink coffee, stay away from sugary options that will leave you feeling sluggish and out of it when the sugar high is over.",
                "Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can cause you to feel draggy and less alert, so drink water throughout the day to remain hydrated and more aware of your surroundings.[5]\n\nIf you feel less alert, try to drink one to two glasses of water right away.\nPass up sugary drinks such as sodas, energy beverages, and sweet juices that will cause an energy crash soon after consuming.",
                "Take deep breaths. When you take deep breaths, you lower your heart rate and blood pressure and improve your circulation. This will increase your energy level and mental focus so you can be more alert. Try this basic exercise you can perform anywhere:[6]\n\nSit up straight. Place one hand on your stomach, just beneath your ribs. Place your other hand on your chest. Try to inhale through your nose. You should feel your stomach pushing your hand outward. Try to keep your chest from moving. Now, pretend you are whistling and breathe out while pursing your lips. Perform 10 repetitions as needed.",
                "Maintain good posture. Your ballet instructor was right when he or she emphasized the importance of excellent posture. Slouching and adopting poor posture can cause fatigue and make you less alert.\n\n\nIf you are seated, make sure your shoulders are back, your eyes are facing straight ahead, and your butt is touching the back of the chair. Try not to hunch over your desk or computer.[7]",
                "Try a power nap. If you are feeling groggy and less than alert, try taking a quick 10 to 20 minute power nap.[8]\n\nA short nap won’t negatively impact your sleep schedule that night, and you should wake up feeling more alert.\nIf you have trouble napping, just rest with your eyes closed for 10 minutes. You can still enjoy the benefits of a power nap.",
                "Chew a piece of gum. If you are having a hard time being alert, try chewing a piece of gum. Some research indicates that this can help you feel more awake and energized.[9]",
                "Listen to music and sing along. If you are at home or driving and need to feel more alert, turn on your music and sing along.[10]\n\nSinging forces you to manage your breathing, while providing a boost of energy.\nThis exercise might not be appropriate for a workplace environment, so wait till you are in a place where people won’t file a noise complaint.",
                "Sniff lemon oil. Essential oils are often used to provide health and mood benefits, and lemon oil is one essential oil that leaves people feeling more alert and energized. Carry lemon oil with you, and take a whiff when you need a quick pick me up.[11]\n\nYou can usually find lemon oil in health food stores or purchase it online.",
                "Enjoy comedy relief. You probably already know that laughter can relieve stress, but it can also increase your alertness.[12]\n\nWhen you want to feel more alert, watch a funny video or spend some time with a friend who makes you giggle.",
                "Opt for a cold shower. While warm showers or baths are relaxing, they can make you feel sleepy and snuggly rather than alert. To combat this, opt for a bracing 3-minute cold shower instead.[13]\n[14]\nYou will immediately feel more alert and aware.",
                "Complete an aerobic workout. When you exercise, you increase blood flow, oxygen levels, and energy to all parts of your body—including the brain—which means you will be more alert. Researchers have also found that regular aerobic exercise such as walking, running, jogging, and riding a bike can reverse cognitive decline.[15][16]",
                "Participate in team sports. If you watch college or professional athletes play sports, you can observe their laser focus and intense concentration. Although you are probably not at that skill level, you can still benefit from the improved reflexes and better concentration that result from participating in team sports.[17]\n\nTeam sports such as baseball, basketball, tennis, soccer, and football are an excellent way to be more alert because you have to pay attention to where your teammates and opposing team members are, where the ball is currently located, and where the ball is headed.\nIf you are looking for a less serious game, consider trying kickball or dodgeball.",
                "Try a new type of exercise. Try a type of exercise that is new to you and involves more complex movements such as rock climbing, gymnastics, martial arts, pilates, skating, or fencing. The act of having to learn how to do something different and perform the new maneuvers will help strengthen your brain and boost your memory power, which should make you more alert.[18]",
                "Spend 20 minutes per day outside. Spending 20 minutes a day outside will help you feel more energized and alert.[19][20]\n\nGo for a walk or jog in the park.\nConduct your workout routine outside in your backyard or neighborhood.\nHead to the woods or hiking trails on the weekend.",
                "Perform yoga. Yoga can help tone your body and relieve your anxiety, but it also improves your focus and concentration. Try a yoga routine when you want to feel more alert.[21]",
                "Schedule your workout for the middle of the day. Research suggests that a mid-afternoon workout can help you feel more alert and energetic than taking a nap.[22][23]",
                "Make sure you eat regularly. If you are not eating regularly, you will have a hard time feeling alert and your mood will also deteriorate. Eat healthy meals during the day, and pack snacks you can munch on when you start to feel less alert.[24]\n\nEating small meals or snacks every few hours will help you keep your energy levels high and elevate your mood.[25]\n\nYogurt, nuts, fresh fruit, baby carrots, and peanut butter on a whole wheat cracker make excellent high-energy snacks.[26]",
                "Choose foods that contain complex carbs. Foods with complex carbohydrates and whole grains help fuel your brain and will leave you feeling more alert.[27][28]\n\nWhen you’re feeling out of it, opt for oatmeal, whole-grain breads and pasta, beans, lentils, and green vegetables.\nPass on cookies, cakes, and foods with lots of sugar because these will not provide lasting energy.",
                "Fill up on antioxidant-rich foods. Foods rich in antioxidants eliminate free radicals, which can deteriorate brain cells and make you less alert. Try these foods that are full of antioxidants:[29][30][31]\n\nRaspberries.\nStrawberries.\nBlueberries.\nApples.\nBananas.\nLeafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale.\nBeans.\nCarrots.\nTea, especially green tea.",
                "Consume foods containing Omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids help keep the brain working properly, so eat foods such as fish and nuts to improve brain power and be more alert.[32]",
                "Eat a piece of chocolate. In addition to caffeine, chocolate contains flavonoids that can improve your cognitive skills and make you feel more alert.[33][34][35]\n\nDark chocolate or bittersweet chocolate have more flavonoids than milk chocolate. You don’t have to eat a king size candy bar to benefit from the chocolate, so don’t overdo it.",
                "Get the right amount of sleep. Not getting enough sleep and oversleeping can leave you feeling groggy and less alert. Medical experts recommend 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.[36]\n\nTo feel more alert, establishing a routine is also important. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.[37]",
                "Adjust the temperature in your room. If it’s too cold in your room or too warm, you can start to feel sleepy and foggy. To be more alert, try increasing or lowering the temperature in your room.[38]\n\nResearchers have concluded that the optimal room temperature for sleep is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit, so adjusting the temperature a few degrees in either direction can help you wake up and feel more focused.\nIf you are in a work environment or place where you do not have control over the thermostat, bring a sweater or jacket with you so you can easily warm up or cool off to feel more alert.",
                "Keep a plant in your home or office. Houseplants filter out chemicals and allergens that drain our energy and cause us to be less alert. Try bringing a plant to keep in your workspace or at home to feel more awake.[39]",
                "Let the sun shine in. Sitting in a darkened room can make you feel less alert because it interferes with the body’s circadian rhythms. Open the curtains or blinds and let the sun shine in.[40]\n\nIf you live in a place where it is seldom sunny or it’s currently dark outside, research indicates that turning on lights can also help you feel more alert.[41]\n\nIf you are in a meeting and need to feel more alert, select a seat by a sunny window.",
                "Consider herbal supplements and vitamins. Although it’s best to talk with your doctor before introducing any herbal supplements or vitamins to your daily routine, you may want to consider trying some of the options below that have been shown to make people more alert:[42]\n\nA vitamin B-12 deficiency can cause memory problems and low energy. The recommended dosage for people age 14 and older is 2.4 micrograms per day. Many multivitamins already contain B-12, so unless you have been diagnosed with a vitamin B-12 deficiency, you may already be getting sufficient levels.[43]\n\nGinseng, according to some research, may elevate your mood and energy levels, which will make you more alert. There are no standard dosages, so talk with your doctor or a pharmacist about how much to take. Make sure you purchase ginseng from a reputable health food store or online retailer because it is expensive and many retailers add filler ingredients to their supplements.[44]\n\nGuarana is an herb high in caffeine that some people believe can help improve mental focus. Check with your doctor about the right dosage for you, but many people trying to be more alert take 200 to 800 milligrams of guarana per day. If you already consume a lot of caffeine, you should use this cautiously because it may disrupt your sleep.[45]\n\nMany pharmacies and health food stores also sell specific energy or alertness vitamins and supplements.",
                "Avoid substances that make you less alert. Drugs and alcohol slow your reaction time, dull your responses, and make you less alert. Avoid these substances if you want to focus, concentrate, and be on your game.[46]",
                "Seek medical advice. If you are having a hard time staying alert, it’s a good idea to talk with a medical professional as soon as possible. There may be an underlying condition causing your symptoms that is best diagnosed and treated by a doctor.[47]",
                "Read regularly. Although you might have to read emails and reports for your job, not many people read regularly for fun. Reading requires you to be active and alert, so pick up a good book and get started.[48][49]\n\nIf you are trying to get in the habit of reading more often, start with a goal of reading one new book each month or every few weeks. Then, you can gradually increase your goal.\nJoining or starting a book club is a great way to get in the habit of reading more often. You will also boost your brain power and alertness by discussing the books with your book group.",
                "Play games. To train yourself to be more alert while having a good time, try playing games. Word searches, chess, crossword puzzles, and sudoku can help help you retain information and concentrate.[50]",
                "Create challenges that force you to focus. Try setting up challenges that force your brain to be alert and on point. Here are a few simple ideas:[51]\n\nCount items in your environment such as stop signs, coffee shops, or a type of tree. You can do this on your way to work or school, and while you are walking, driving, or riding a bike.\nWatch a digital clock that displays the seconds. Occasionally, the clock will skip a second. It’s your job to identify when that happens. To increase the level of difficulty, add distractions to the mix by turning on a radio or television in the background.",
                "Try to think quickly. When you find yourself feeling foggy and less alert, try to force yourself out of your slump by thinking quickly. Here are a few easy ideas to start with:[52][53]\n\nIncrease your reading pace to feel more alert.\nStart a conversation about a stimulating topic such as politics.\nWork with classmates or colleagues to plan and brainstorm about a specific topic, and enjoy the surge of adrenaline.\nLearn about something new and interesting to increase your level of alertness.",
                "Try mindfulness meditation. Practicing mindful meditation can help you improve your concentration and focus so you can become more alert.While there are many mindfulness meditation exercises you can do, here is a quick example that will help you feel more focused and aware:[54]\n\nFind a quiet location free from as many distractions as possible. Then, pick a position where you are comfortable, but alert.\nSlowly take a deep breath in, paying attention to how your breath feels when it enters your body. Next, exhale slowly while concentrating on what it feels like when your breath leaves your body.\nIt’s normal to feel distracted, but try to focus only on your breathing. Noticing when your mind drifts and you become distracted is an important step in training yourself to be more alert. When this happens, don’t feel bad. Instead, just calmly refocus on your breath."

        "How to Write a Sermon": {
            "intro": "Can you develop effective lessons for sermons one, two, three, or even more times a week? It can be done by following these simple steps. So how do you create your Christian lessons and sermons? No, not a borrowed lesson or sermon that might do for once or occasionally, like in an emergency. Sure, you can get something to teach or preach about quickly that way, but will it be relevant to you and your audience? Here are some ideas on how to form your lesson or sermon.",
            "steps": [
                "Follow, above all, the scriptures and the leading of the Holy Spirit for God's purpose in the lives of your congregation. Seek a heartfelt \"anointing\".",
                "Get a clear idea of what you intend to teach. Study and pray to seek The Holy Spirit's guidance: be enthused. Usually the basis of the idea should be backed up with Bible scripture. You never will begin to preach without a direction or purpose, if you follow the steps to get it organized.",
                "Plan and make an outline for your topic that is something you would like to know more about and can explain and teach to: that does not mean to create a story like literature, or a lecture and not even to write an essay, but you do need to plan it as explained in the Three Part Outline section.\n\n\nA lesson or sermon is usually best, if it is spoken without memorizing it all and not even writing it all down in complete sentences, and then you cannot merely read it, but use a meaningful outline. Make your key words larger so that they stand out in your eye and in your mind. That can be like a map to follow. A lesson or sermon should be better when it is not like a speech or oration that a public speaker (such as a politician) might simply read to an audience, unless you are an extremely effective reader.\nEach sermon may be a whole new topic or one in a \"series\" of multiple sermons or lessons.",
                "Be dynamic, with a living phrasing by not merely reading it, so that it is not set in stone, and then you can feel more inspired and alive, and make a more inspiring communication between the teacher/preacher and the class or the congregation.",
                "Try \"not\" relying on very detailed notes, but that does not mean that you will be speaking without your plan or without your outline.\n\n\nKnow the outline and the plan so well that you don't need to look at it or your notes more than an occasional glance, or so that you only need the larger key word to make it click in your mind, but you can have them there, open and available.",
                "Be direct; get to the point of the message that is intended, but how do you do it?",
                "Think of a topic as having three simple parts in the message or lesson like a three part outline. That three part process is given next.",
                "Introduce your message topic: tell what you are going to cover and why, or why it's important, or how it is relevant.\n\n\nYou may give a humorous remark about what it does or does not mean.\nUse a starting point related to a scripture or an event that was/is the impetus for the main idea.",
                "Teach the message by developing it (expanding upon it): give examples and tell who is involved?, when?, where?, how?, why? and alternatives, or what the different events might be.\n\n\nSince you gave the concept to be developed in the introduction, then you and the class or congregation know what you are talking about, and you know upon what you will make a conclusion.\nDevelop your main points with examples like a story or two, Biblical parables, part of a song, church events or such that you can weave into the topic.\nYou may realize that there would be objections in your topic like:\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"How did that happen?\"\n\"What if ______________ (name something) happened?\"\n\n\nAnd so, ask those as \"rhetorical\" questions (not to seek an answer from the audience, unless it's a small group), and answer them like:\n\"What if _________ (something) happened? Well, then ____________ (this) is what you or someone can do because ___________ (whatever), but then...\" (fill in the blanks beforehand) -- and so you would answer the objections or questions for them. If you do allow answers, wait for it... as in a class room; don't disagree with the answer unless it is important to say why \"Actually, I feel like this is the answer: _______\" (giving your view). Generally, suspend judgment so you neither praise nor ignore comments, and you can nod and say one or a few words in response \"I see.\", while nodding agreeably, \"Okay.\", \"I see your point.\" or \"Thank you.\" or such a non-judgmental remark -- and then steer it onto the path it was supposed to be on (without characterizing the comment as right or wrong).",
                "Conclude with issuing a call to action based on the matter in the topic. Perhaps this would be a call to accept Jesus as Savior. This is putting the finish on what you introduced and developed--such as to remember to try the ideas, pray, invite others, or study, etc.\n\n\nThis is like an assignment to do the things that you taught or preached about.",
                "Rely on other people for advice and all of your ideas: No, not really. It is a good idea to have someone to talk ideas over with, if you would not talk and visit all day with various people, and avoid not studying or preparing well -- that won't work very often.",
                "Talk to other teachers/preachers to get ideas, but that could become a habit, be a crutch and a waste of time for both of you, if the two of you have different needs and objectives.",
                "Try to use various collections of sermon outlines from old or new books of sermons, but change it to fit you needs.\n\n\nFind sermon outline services on the Internet, completely organize them, to your needs.\nThey probably can't serve your needs, if you just pick out a sermon outline that sort of sounds okay, but it is something that does not particularly inspire or inform, or about which you wouldn't care to talk/hear yourself.\nThey won't be in your style, in your order, or right for the way you feel or speak.\nDownload collections of lessons or sermons:\nSome great old-time religion materials should be found out there, for free.\nConsider subscribing to preaching outlines perhaps with Power Point presentations, with pictures, and examples--even with a complete order of service, list of verses, cross references, and songs to use.",
                "Consider Bible software that has The Bible, commentary, dictionary, cross references which can all be great.\n\n\nUse free Bible look-up websites accessible for 25 versions and even with different languages such as [1] and [2]; the two sites totally free and are quite different from each other: see the sources and citations below.",
                "Pray and read your Bible daily. Give thanks, take notes, think and muse on the scriptures, and so be in the right frame of mind to reach and receive inspirations."

        "How to Be Tactful": {
            "intro": "Isaac Newton once said, \"Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.\" Being tactful is just that — having the ability to clearly communicate your message while being sensitive to those around you and not unintentionally offending anyone. Being tactful does not mean hiding what you really feel; it just means presenting your ideas in a way that would make them the most appealing and inoffensive. If you want to know how to be tactful, then you should see Step 1 to get started.",
            "steps": [
                "Think before you speak. Allow yourself a pause to consider how your words could be perceived, and to prevent yourself from making hasty comments. You may have an immediate gut reaction to something your boss or friend is saying, but take a moment to gather your thoughts before you come right out and say what you want to say. Ask yourself if it's the best time to present your ideas, if you should spend some time finding a better way to say what you want to say, and if people will be receptive to your comments right then.\n\n\nThough speaking with your gut can lead to a lot of interesting ideas, it can also help to take a few minutes to formulate your thoughts first. If you instantly disagree with something your boss says, for example, you're better off thinking of concrete examples for why you disagree instead of just blurting out that you think it's a bad idea.\nNotice the people around you. You may want to make a comment about how excited you are for your wedding, when one of the people there is going through a bitter divorce. Though you don't have to hide your enthusiasm forever, you may be better off finding a better time to make your comment.",
                "Deflect negative comments. If people are making negative comments around you, you should avoid getting wrapped up in them if you want to be tactful. This is especially true if you're in the workplace and don't want to be part of the office politics. There are several ways in which you can deflect negative comments and take the high road in testy situations. Here are some ways to do it:\n\n\nGently correct gossip. Example: \"I'm sorry you heard that about Jane Doe. When I spoke to her, she said that it was just a rumor about her getting fired.\"\nSay something non-committal. Example: \"I've never met John Doe, so I wouldn't have a clue about his drinking habits.\"\nSay something positive. \"Mary Sue may be late a lot, but she does really good work.\" Or, \"Bill Jones has always been civil to me personally.\"\nChange the subject. \"You know, your comment about the boss reminds me of something. There's an office party coming up, right? Are you bringing anyone?\"\nRemove yourself from the situation. If people keep being negative and the situation isn't letting up, then you can excuse yourself and say you need to get back to class or work. You should make it seem unrelated to the conversation at hand.\nAsk the person nicely to stop. Say \"I'm really not interested in gossiping about our neighbor,\" or \"I'd prefer not talk about that in the office.\"",
                "Start with a positive comment before giving negative feedback. If you have to give negative feedback to someone, whether it's a coworker or your best friend, you should couch it in a way that makes the person the most receptive. This doesn't mean you should lie to the person if things aren't going well, but that you should start off with something positive so the person sees that you care about him or her. Here are some ways to do it:\n\n\nIf you want to give negative feedback to a friend, you can say something like, \"I think it's so sweet of you to always want to set me up with the single guys you know. But when you try to do it every time we go out, it kind of makes me feel pathetic.\"\nIf you want to give negative feedback to a co-worker, you can say something like, \"I really appreciate how hard you've been working on the new project. However, I think the project can be even better if you let Mary help you out a bit more.\"",
                "Choose your words carefully. When it comes to being tactful, one of the most important things to keep in mind is that you should be aware of the words you use to express your ideas. You can still say what you want to say without offending people or coming off mean or like a know-it-all. When you're getting ready to state an opinion, ask yourself if the words you're using are biased, hurtful, patronizing, or just all wrong for the occasion. Then, find the words that will help further your ideas without offending anyone.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to talk to a coworker about how she needs to get her work done faster, don't tell her she's \"slow\"; instead, ask her if she can think of ways to be \"more efficient.\"\nFor example, if you're telling your boss you're leaving your job, you don't have to say something like, \"I am just way too smart for these people\"; instead, you can say something like, \"This company isn't the best fit for me.\"",
                "Choose your timing carefully. When it comes to being tactful, having great timing is half the battle. You may have something perfectly nice to say, which can ruin a social situation if you say it at the wrong time, and can lead to hurt feelings without you meaning to do any harm. Before you make a comment, ask yourself if this is the best time to make the comment, and if everyone there will be receptive to it. Ask yourself if it would be better to wait to get a more positive response, even if you're dying to say what you want to say.\n\n\nFor example, if your friend Linda is excited to tell all of her friends about her recent engagement, then you may have to hold off the news that you're pregnant for another week, so Linda can enjoy the spotlight for a bit longer. You don't want her to feel like you trumped her big day.\nFor example, if your boss is wrapping up a long presentation at the end of the work day, this may not be the best time to ask your question about an unrelated report. Asking the question now will only lead to confusion and your boss will be focused on the presentation and won't have the energy to address your concerns; if you wait until the next day, your boss will be happier to discuss the issue with you.",
                "Decline invitations politely. If someone asks you to do something, you should find a way to politely decline it, even if your gut is screaming, \"Heck no!\" Whether you're being asked to attend the baby shower of a person you barely know or to stay late at work on a Friday night, instead of immediately saying no and looking angry or upset about it, you should take the time to say how much you would like to do it and then give a brief explanation or apology about not being able to do it. This will still get the same message across, but you won't offend anyone in the process.\n\n\nFor example, if your boss asks you to take on another project and you just don't have any more time on your hands, you can say something like, \"Thank you so much for thinking of me for this opportunity. Unfortunately, I'm still wrapping up those two other projects you asked me about and I won't be able to take on the extra work. But I would love to help out on something similar in the future.\"\nFor example, if your friend invites you to go hiking but hiking isn't really your thing, you can say something like, \"Your weekend trip to the Redwood forest sounds amazing, but I'm going to take it easy this weekend — I've had a crazy week at work and need to decompress. How about we catch up over drinks next Friday?\"",
                "Don't reveal too much personal information to people you don't know very well. Another thing that people who lack tact tend to do is to go about announcing their business to every person on the street. If you want to have tact, then you can't go around telling anyone within earshot about your latest breakup, your new rash, or all of your personal problems. Telling people you don't know well all your business will only make them uncomfortable and won't lead to any new friendships; have tact and be aware of when people would like to hear more and when enough is enough.\n\n\nThis also goes for revealing personal information about other people. If you're with a close friend and a few less-than-close friends, don't pick up on a private conversation you had with that friend in front of the other people; your friend might have been happy to talk about his complicated relationship with his mother with you, but he may not want the world to know about it.",
                "Make sure your body language reflects your words. It's great if your words are sending a friendly and polite message, but if your body is telling people something different, then they'll quickly get a different picture. If you're telling someone something important in a delicate way, then you should make eye contact, face the person, and not hunch over or look at the floor. Give the person your attention and show that you actually care. It'll be hard for them to take you seriously if you're telling the person that he or she is doing great at work while you're looking in the other direction.\n\n\nActions really can speak louder than words, so make sure that your body isn't sending a different message from your mouth.",
                "Consider the other person's viewpoint and acknowledge it. Another part of having tact is being able to understand where another person is coming from. Though voicing your own ideas is important, it's also important to understand that another person may not see things the way you see them. If you let the person know that you understand where he or she is coming from, they'll be much more likely to listen to you and to take your ideas seriously.\n\n\nFor example, saying something like, \"Mary, I understand that you've had a lot on your plate recently...\" can make it easier for you to ask Mary to help out with another project. If you just say, \"Hey, can you stay late to finish up a new report for me?\" then Mary is likely to think you're insensitive.",
                "Consider cultural differences and try to act in a sensitive way without being asked. There are many cultural differences that should be acknowledged in our world, which are based on where people are from, how they were raised, what their race and backgrounds may be, or even what generation they are coming from. What may be perfectly acceptable in one culture can be considered rude in another, so ask yourself if you're being sensitive to the different cultures around you before you make a comment.",
                "Be discreet. You may find that you need to correct something a co-worker said during a presentation, or that one of your friends has a giant chunk of spinach in his teeth. Instead of pointing this out in front of everyone, you should try to pull the person aside to let them know about the situation. Showing discretion is a big part of having tact, because it will help you know what should be said under what circumstances. It's an important skill you should have in the professional and the social world.\n\n\nFor example, if you and your partner got a raise but no one else in the company did, it's best not to brag about it in front of everyone. You can have a private celebration later.",
                "Be gracious even when you're irritated. Keep your cool and speak kindly and sincerely. Assume the best. Though you may be dying to tell your friend what you really think of her behavior, or you really want to yell at your co-worker for ruining a project, you should hold your tongue and be as kind as possible until you find a time to state your true feelings. There's no point in saying something you'll regret just because you're irked in the moment.\n\n\nFor example, if someone gives you an ugly sweater, say: \"Thanks so much for the present. I'm touched you thought of me.\"",
                "Have empathy for others. Look around you before you make a comment and see how the other people there will receive it. It's important to know where people are coming from before you blurt out your political, religious, or other personal opinions. Though you can't completely know where every person is coming from when you speak, it's important to have a sense of the mindset and experiences of the people around you so you can avoid offending people.\n\n\nFor example, if you just got a raise and Bob got fired, this may not be the time to brag about it.\nIf one of the people around you is a devout Christian, then it's not the time to talk about how you think religion is pointless.\nIf someone around you is exhausted after a long day, don't expect the person to help you resolve a huge emotional conflict. Have patience.",
                "Be an active listener. Being an active listener is a crucial component of being tactful. There's a difference between what someone is saying to you and what that person is really thinking, so you should really look and hear the person out to get the real message. If your friend is telling you that she's over her break up and totally ready to go to a party with you, but her eyes and gestures are telling you otherwise, then find a way to kindly tell her that it's okay if she's not ready to go out.\n\n\nPaying attention to how people are really feeling as they're speaking can help you respond to them in the most tactful way possible. For example, if your co-worker is really struggling with a project but is afraid to ask for help, listen for cues, such as nervousness, stuttering, or repetitive speech to see if he or she is trying to reach out to you.\nActively listening can also help you see if a person has shut down and doesn't want to hear any more about a subject. If you're giving feedback to a coworker who is already upset by it, you can tell by his or her words that he may not be ready to hear more; you should gracefully end the conversation and pick it up later.",
                "Be respectful. Being respectful goes hand in hand with being tactful. If you want to have true tact, then you have to treat other people with respect. This means letting them finish talking instead of interrupting them, giving them your full attention when they are trying to tell you something, and asking people how they are doing before jumping in to deliver some bad news. Treat each and every individual with care and kindness and understand that it's important to make people feel that they are treated fairly, even if they may not be your favorite people on the planet.\n\n\nBeing respectful is a matter of common decency. Don't curse in front of your elders; don't use lewd language in front of people you don't know well. This will come off as very tasteless, and therefore lacking tact."

            "intro": "When you become a Tupperware sales consultant, you will have the opportunity to sell a variety of Tupperware products and earn income based on the amount of product sold. To become a Tupperware sales consultant, you must first meet with a Tupperware distributor or consultant in your area who will assist you with signing up for the consultant program. After signing up, you will be required to purchase a Tupperware starter kit that provides you with the materials you need to begin selling product. You can then sell Tupperware by either promoting the product online or by hosting parties and other events in your local area.",
            "steps": [
                "Learn about Tupperware consulting as a career. Before you begin your career in Tupperware consulting, try to learn a bit about the career path itself. Tupperware consulting can be done as a hobby, in addition to another job, or it can be done full time.\n\n\nTupperware consulting places you in an established, nationwide community of other consultants and salespeople. Tupperware consulting is a good career option if you work well on a flexible schedule, are highly self motivated, and a very social person. Consulting involves interacting with others and maintaining positive relationships with peers and customers.[1]\n\nAs a Tupperware consultant, you would work on behalf of a manager selling a variety of Tupperware products. Consultants usually host parties, but Tupperware can also be sold at fundraisers and online. While you have a great deal of personal freedom in regards to setting your own schedule, usually there are certain quotas in terms of sales and money you must meet.[2]\n\nWhile many people make Tupperware consulting work as a full time career, a lot of people are able to see Tupperware on the side as a supplement to existing income.",
                "Find a Tupperware sales consultant in your local area. In order to begin consulting, you'll need to network with an existing Tupperware consultant in your area. He or she can help you get started and answer any questions you have about the world of Tupperware consulting.\n\n\nThere are a variety of websites that can help you find a consultant in your area by entering your zip code. They can also help you find the contact information of an existing consultant you know of by entering a name. Most Tupperware consultants have their own personal website or blog. Browse the website of a variety of consultants until you find someone whose values and goals seem to match up with yours.\nIf you're not comfortable with online networking, you can attend a variety of Tupperware parties in your area. Flyers for Tupperware parties are found in churches, schools, community centers, and local coffee shops. By attending various parties, you can get a sense of a specific consultant sales style and strategy and see if they'd be a good match to help you get started.",
                "Meet with the local Tupperware consultant. E-mail or call an existing consultant to set up a meeting. During the meeting, the Tupperware consultant will speak with you in more detail about his or her program and help you get signed up.\n\n\nGo into the meeting with a list of questions prepared. Ask about the expectations for sales, how much you'll make on commission, what sort of events this particularly company supports, and how to be successful in the field.[3]\n\nDo not make a decision on whether or not to work with this company based on an initial meeting. Ask for time to think it over and spend a few days reviewing the information you've gathered.[4]",
                "Purchase Tupperware sales consultant kits. In order to get started, you'll have to buy a Tupperware sales consultant kit. This kit will come with learning material about consulting as well as a variety of products you'll have to sell at your start-up party and fundraiser.\n\n\nBefore choosing a kit, read and review the information provided to you in the starter kit. Each starter kit will contain an informative consultant manual, a pack of order forms, party hostess forms, catalogs, and a variety of Tupperware products. See if the products do well on the market. Do consumers find the products useful? Do they generally sell well and get good reviews online?\nAsk existing consultants who've used this kit how they liked it. Did they find the manual helpful and informative? Did the kit allow them a smooth transition into the world of Tupperware consulting? Was there anything they wished was different about the kit? It's okay to call the consultant you initially met and ask such questions, but you should ask a variety of consultants to get a wider perspective. You can find other consultants online or ask the consultant you first spoke with for contact information of other Tupperware consultants in the area.",
                "Decide how you want to sell Tupperware. As a Tupperware sales consultant, you can choose from a variety of sales methods for selling Tupperware products. You can sell Tupperware online or host house parties and fundraisers.\n\n\nIf you choose to sell Tupperware online, you'll be able to see products to anyone throughout the US. You can make sales through your own personal website, taking out classified ads, going on message boards, blogging, and through other online marketing means. If you're online savvy and interested in social media and online communication, this might be the best route for you.[5]\n\nYou can also host Tupperware parties in your own home, in which you invite over friends and community members to have drinks, snacks, and buy Tupperware products. Some parties will involve buying and selling goods in your own home while others, known as catalogue parties, will allow guests to place orders for products that will then be shipped to them. If you are a social person and enjoy entertaining, this may be the best route for you.[6]",
                "Consider taking online courses. Some sales consulting kits come with online tutorials and coursework that can help you learn the basics of Tupperware sales. However, it might be a good idea to take a supplementary online course on marketing or business, especially if you're interested in Tupperware consulting as a sustainable career rather than just a side job. Many colleges and universities offer some online courses and a variety of colleges, such as Kaplan, are mostly based online. You can browse course listings and see requirements for attendance by browsing the websites of a variety of colleges, community colleges, and universities.",
                "Advertise. Once you feel secure enough to begin your business, you need to advertise that you're going into Tupperware consulting. There are a variety of ways to advertise your business and it's recommended you choose multiple routes to advertise.\n\n\nYou can start by advertising around your own community. You can put up flyers in community centers, churches, schools, and local coffee shops. You can take out a classified ad in the local newspaper or pay for a short radio commercial.[7]\n\nIf you're doing mostly online based sales, social media websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter allow you to reach out to people throughout the US. You can also ask friends and peers to re-post your events and invite people to attend.",
                "Host a start up party. Your start-up party with the first party or event you host as a Tupperware consultant. This party may be in person or it may be online. Many 24 hour online sales, for example, are referred to as \"parties\" or \"start up parties.\"\n\n\nIf you're hosting an in person party, be prepared. Ask guests to RSVP as you'll have a rough sense of how many people to expect. Prepare food and drinks in advance. If it's in your budget, you might want to consider hiring a caterer as this can make the event appear more professional. You'll want to have some kind of station set up, demonstrating the Tupperware available for purchase.[8]\n\nA theme is always nice when hosting a party. You could base a theme around a close by holiday, like a St. Patrick's Day or Valentine's Day theme. You could also choose seasonal themes, like a fall or winter party. There are also general themes that you could do year round, such as a decades theme like a 60's party or an 80's party.[9]\n\nGames are always nice to move the party along between buying and selling Tupperware. Many Tupperware consulting websites and forums post ideas on how to incorporate your products into a game. You could also simply play a board game or cards between presentations and sales.[10]\n\nMake sure, before planning the party, it's clear how much you're supposed to charge for products and how much you'll personally make on commission. Review any documents or contracts you signed prior to the party to make sure all is understood.",
                "Let your business grow. After your start up party, you should let your business continue to grow. Plan future events, online or otherwise, and expand your advertising presence as the money comes in to do so. Having a personal website, even if you're not online savvy, is pretty much a must for any business. People interested in your products will want somewhere to go to get your contact information and look up an event calendar. You could also take out space in the local phone book. Make sure you host regular events as people will be more likely to remember you, attend, and spread the word if you're operating on a regular schedule."

        "How to Buy Gold Bars": {
            "intro": "The purchase of gold in general, and gold bars in particular, has long been a popular investment for banks, investors, and collectors. Gold bars offer a tangible, relatively simple way to to protect against deflation and balance one's investment portfolio.[1][2]",
            "steps": [
                "Calculate your investment and/or purchase capacity. This will help you choose your product when you make a gold bar purchase from the mint you select later.[3][4][5]\n\nGold bars for personal purchase typically come in measurements of ounces and/or grams such as: 1 ounce; 10 ounces; 100 grams; or 1 kilogram (32.15 ounces).\nThe exact price you pay per ounce or gram will depend on market value at the time of your order. Sometimes you can see the real-time stock exchange rate for gold on the seller's website you are choosing. You can also check prices on an exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange) directly at other websites, or financial information locations.\nSave the gold market value information to compare against the prices you get per ounce or gram with your gold sellers later on.",
                "Write down several gold sellers/mints you might use. You might want to separate the list by domestic and international sellers. The seller location will have a significant impact on shipping costs.[6][7][8]\n\nExamine if the company you are looking at is selling the gold bars to you directly or is simply a go-between for another seller. If they are a go-between, there may be additional fees and costs that are increasing your price.\nIf you are looking at companies that are themselves internationally based in addition to using international mints, you may be dealing with higher shipping fees. For example, if the mint and seller are both based in Switzerland, but you are shipping to the United States, you will pay higher shipping fees than if at least the seller is U.S. based.\nCompanies that don't have active and up to date websites should be considered potential scams. Save yourself some investigation time later by crossing them off your list early.",
                "Confirm each gold seller/mint's credentials and website if applicable. You want to make sure their information is accurate, easy to understand, and up to date.[9][10][11][12][13]\n\nIf you see the Better Business Bureau logo, this is a good sign, but don't just assume it's legitimate. Go to the BBB's website and search for the company on that end. Anyone can copy a logo and paste it onto their website with some testimonials.\nSearch for some reviews of the mint and seller to see if business with them has gone smoothly. Look particularly for treatment of customers that had problems. Did they get resolutions to whatever issue in an efficient manner? If there is a frequent case of reviews reflecting poor customer service, you should select another company.\nCheck the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to see if the seller and/or mint has had any misconduct problems. If they have, you should consider using another company.\nIf you have any trouble getting information from the company in the first place such as contact information, gold prices, source of their gold, shipping and storage practices, etc., do not do business of any kind with them. Use another company.",
                "Submit a purchase order to your chosen seller. This is to be done once you've confirmed what seller you will use, the source mint, and number of gold bars you want to buy.[14][15][16][17][18]\n\nMake sure there have been no significant changes in price between the time you researched the purchase and when you actually submitted the order. Delay times in the readout for the stock market chart you used to see the trading price for gold could affect this too.\nThe time-lag for web-based stock market readouts can vary from a few seconds to several minutes.\nCheck if there is a minimum order amount and be sure you've met those requirements along with any other reasonable requests made by the seller.\nLet the gold seller know if you're selling another investment (including another precious metal) to pay for this purchase.\nConfer with the seller about making sure the proper sale information is reported to the Internal Revenue Service if you exceed the $10,000 threshold for trade or business transactions.",
                "Confirm order details. Gather details for shipping and storage coming up once the gold bar purchase order is complete.\n\n\nMake sure you have copies of all receipts of: the purchase order; trade; and shipping invoice(s).\nThoroughly check that the seller and you have the same address for the destination of the gold bar(s) shipment.\nContact the destination location at this time to let them know the gold bars are coming. These shipment times may vary, so you can factor in the security of waiting until closer to the delivery date. If more preparation is needed at the storage site, such as installation of more security or a vault, then give more advanced notice.",
                "Look up offers of gold selling from smaller or private dealers. This is a potential avenue of purchasing gold bars at lower prices in expectation of their value going up. But there are higher risks.[19][20][21]\n\n\"We Buy Gold\" type places may not sell gold bars. These businesses may only buy your jewelry, so you will want to look elsewhere.\nPawn shops are another place you can look, but this is also extremely risky. The dealer may overcharge or undercharge you for the gold bars. Knowing the right price will be as much up to your own research. Additionally, pawn shops may not have a wide selection of purchasing options, or have an accurate account of the history of the product. Sometimes the goods can even be stolen, and you may not be able to verify the weight and purity of the gold.\nPersonal or local sellers can at least offer a more relaxed shopping environment than other choices. This will offer both you and the seller time to explore collecting options, work out details of shipment and storage, and this method offers the benefit of potentially faster fulfillment of your order.",
                "Go to a gold/coin selling show. These sellers will likely be experienced at negotiating deals. Go in prepared.[22]\n\nHave accurate price listings for the sellers you're interested in. Keep the price list out of sight to avoid looking like a newcomer.\nDon't rush or feel rushed by other hurried buyers and collectors.\nBe prepared to come back late in a show to take advantage of last minute sales.\nHave multiple means of payment prepared including cash. You should take an early look around to gauge how much money you will need to have prepared.",
                "Go to a gold/coin shop. If you can find a specialty shop, then this is a potential option to buy gold bars. Like the pawn shops, these specialty gold shops are a limited option.[23]\n\nLocal gold/coin shops may have limited selections and may not even have gold bullion in the form of bars.\nThere could be a price trade off using a local shop. The local shop may help you save on shipping and handling fees by allowing you to pick up your order immediately. But the costs of the seller running the shop, and taxes, will be factored into the sale price.\nLocal shops do have the advantage of the security of a direct transfer of the gold bar product to the purchaser, rather than shipping to an intermediary. You can see the product you will buy immediately.\nYou will not have the rush or hectic situation you would encounter during a show, but you may still have to engage in some negotiating for price. However, you will be able to get more individualized attention including exchange of knowledge about the gold bars you are dealing with. Investment advice may also be exchanged.\nFor example, you might go to a local dealer and ask about his selection of bars, but start off saying, \"Is this a good time to buy gold bars compared to other precious metals like silver or platinum?\" or \"How do your rates compare to the market rate of gold prices?\"\nPayment options will vary, so be prepared to have many options available including cash and credit.",
                "Buy from a private listing. There is a great risk for scams with this option. This is a method that should generally be avoided unless you have thorough knowledge of the person you are dealing with, and the technical ability to evaluate the gold bar(s) product for authenticity.[24][25][26]\n\nGet accurate specifications for each bar you are purchasing. Have means to measure the size and weight of them when you are ready to take possession. Calipers and a scale are good ideas to bring along for the latter.\nHave up-to-date information on the market price of gold. If the seller is charging much less than the market price, then the deal may be \"too good to be true.\"\nThere is frequently a risk that you will pay and get sold nothing. Have some arrangement of secure payment for goods set up. PayPal is a possibility. PayPal is at least a secure form of payment, but does not guarantee you will receive goods.\nWalking around with cash in large amounts for the exchange, while feasible, is dangerous.\nYou and the seller need to make arrangements, besides payment, for a safe place to exchange the gold bars (or ship them) that allows you a reasonable amount of security to track and confirm the order. Because both of you are private owners, insurance for the gold bars will need to be arranged early in this process, either on the seller or buyer end.\nTrust your instincts. If anything about the seller or deal seems uncertain, call it off.",
                "Confirm authenticity of your gold bar purchase. You want to be sure that the bars you bought have the proper certification.[27]\n\nGold bars can come brand new from the mint or have passed through several owners before they get to you.\nGold bars direct from the mint have the highest \"visual\" appeal, and lowest chance of being counterfeit. These bars should come with a certificate of authenticity from the mint. Online dealers usually sell these bars.\nSecond-hand gold bars, ones that have lost some shine due to oxidation, do not lose their gold value. These bars are usually sold by local shops and/or collectors. If you buy these bars, insist on getting their assay certificates or \"Certicards\" issued by the original mint upon their resale.",
                "Get insurance for the shipment. This could be an added expense, but a good idea for such a valuable package as gold bars. The insurance may be provided by the shipper and/or your own company.[28][29][30]\n\nMost sellers will take the insurance burden onto themselves at least while the gold bars are in transit. This is full insurance, meaning total reimbursement for loss, while the gold bars are on the move.\nOnce the gold reaches its destination, the insurance coverage usually ends, and the burden shifts to the recipient. So your own insurance company should be informed of your taking possession usually at the storage point.\nIf you have a seller that is not insuring the gold in transit, you should ask your insurance company if they will cover gold bars from the mint to destination before you make the purchase. If not, you might need to change sellers.",
                "Ask the mint for shipping method and tracking number(s). Sellers should use standard shipping companies such as Federal Express, United Parcel Service or the United States Postal Service.[31][32][33][34][35][36]\n\nYou should get a tracking number and estimated delivery duration/time as soon as the gold bars leave for the destination.\nIdeally, the seller will use discreet methods to ship the bars. This means hiding the contents of the package such as: leaving names off invoices; use of plain wrappings; avoiding re-directs of the shipping route; and anything else that might risk the security of the gold bars or your information.",
                "Contact the shipping destination if necessary. Once the shipment of gold bars is en route, then it is a good idea to contact the storage destination to make sure there are no problems with receiving a secure shipment.[37]\n\nIf you are shipping to a commercial location such as a UPS Store you might want to be sure you are okay with them taking possession of such a valuable package. Make sure the commercial location representatives are comfortable with it as well. Otherwise, you need to make other arrangements.\nIf you are sending this to a bank, make sure you have pre-arranged storage in a safe deposit box as will be mentioned in a later step.\nIf you are sending this to your home you should consider increasing security in and around your house as will be mentioned in a later step. If you cannot be home at the time of delivery see the next step.\nIf you are sending this to a storage facility operated or authorized by the seller, then be sure you know by what means you can confirm your gold bar shipment's arrival and storage, and ask about a visual inspection.",
                "Make sure you or someone authorized can sign for the shipment. You want to be sure delivery is confirmed especially since insurance from the seller usually lapses once the gold bars reach their destination.\n\n\nTry to be home yourself if you have the bars shipped to your home. If you can't make it, then arrange for someone you trust to sign for the bars instead.\nYou can leave instructions for the gold bars to be left with another party, such as a building manager in an apartment complex or UPS Store clerk, but this is risky. You cannot be sure of who will be on duty in third-party situations, and will not be immediately available to inspect the gold bars package for an accurate count. There is no guarantee the package will be stored safely.\nIf you've shipped the bars to a bank you will need to be present to put the bar package into the safe deposit box.",
                "Get clarification for what happens if there is a problem in transit. Theft, transportation accidents, and errors in shipment are but a few of the problems that could happen to your order. Make sure you've asked the seller what the steps are to correct such problems if they occur.[38]\n\nAsk who is liable for problems while the gold is in transit. This ties into the insurance step. If the seller is insuring the shipment they should be handling the risk with any reimbursement going to you.\nAsk who is liable once the gold bars reach the destination. Usually this shifts the risk back to you, the recipient, though if you have an agreement with the storage facility they may take some of the risk. Also, your own insurance may be covering the gold bars at this point.\nMake sure you know what risks are covered and which are not. Physical problems like theft and accidents are insured, but financial problems such as recessions are not.",
                "Look at your storage facility's credentials. You want a facility with the right combination of: high levels of security; accessibility for legitimate customers; and trustworthy personnel.[39][40][41]\n\nAs with examining the company for selling and/or minting you want to make sure the storage facility has legitimate information, positive independent reviews, and handles customer service decently.\nConsider the location of the storage facility. Is it close enough for you to check on the gold bars visually if you want to? How often would you do these visual inspections? If you are going to check on them frequently you want a storage vault at least in your region of the country.\nIf you are using your bank, then you should arrange for an inspection of the safe deposit box that will store the gold bar(s) to make sure it's adequate for your needs.",
                "Get your insurance company's coverage information. Consult with your insurance company to see how much of the gold bar investment in each storage facility would be covered. It could be that one facility has security arrangements that rate a better coverage profile than another.[42][43][44]\n\nStorage facilities are usually insured, so confirm their insurance company's coverage as well.\nIf you are using your bank's safe deposit box, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does not cover its contents, but standard insurance might.",
                "Check for ease of your access. You should be able to get in and out of your chosen storage facility whenever you want while observing security protocols.\n\n\nIf you're using a bank safe deposit box, this should be standard access hours for any bank.\nIf you're using a seller's facility or another vault facility, then you should ask for a full schedule of their hours and any holidays or limits.",
                "Check your home for possible storage. This is a risky idea consider the danger of theft to a home, but it does put the gold bars in your immediate reach.[45]\n\nYou might consider placing a vault within the structure of your home. This includes putting the vault somewhere out of sight of a thief and even casual onlookers.\nYou should have a vault or safe that guards against theft, fire, water, and other kinds of damage. These can cost up to several hundreds even thousands of dollars for elaborate models. But some inexpensive ones can be found. Just as important is to keep them hidden such as in a wall or under a floor.",
                "Review security procedures at the storage location. Check on alarms, entry procedures, staffing, auditing, and the like at your chosen storage facility.[46][47]\n\nYou want to be sure your gold bars are well kept even if they are insured.\nHave a conversation with your storage facility's manager/representative about their alarms. You might ask, \"Are they working and tested regularly?\" If not, then this is a bad sign of too relaxed security.\nLook at the entry methods. Does the facility use photo identification, swipe-cards, biometrics (fingerprint scanners, eye scans, or similar), key pads, or some combination of these for entry? If the entry is too simple, then this is a warning sign of an easily breached system. Though if it's too complex, then it can be inconvenient.\nAsk them if they do thorough background checks on employees and avoid hiring people with a criminal record. If not, then this leaves the facility vulnerable to personnel trouble.\nAsk the facility representative about their auditing reports. You should get information at regular intervals about the seller/storage facilities activities so you know your bars aren't being mishandled.\nIn the case of a bank safe deposit box you may expect the bank manager to reveal only so much about their security. Get as much as you need to feel comfortable."

        "wikiHow to Make Ink from Tea": {
            "intro": "Making your own ink is a lot of fun. Plus, natural ink made from tea and other simple ingredients is much healthier than other ink products you may buy. Using black tea, water, gum arabic or cornstarch, and an optional splash of vinegar, you can create a high-quality homemade ink in very little time.",
            "steps": [
                "Gather materials. For this process, you are going to need black tea, water, and a thickening agent (either gum arabic or cornstarch). Some recipes also call for vinegar, which can make your ink a bit more uniform in color. You will also need a few measuring spoons, a metal or wooden spoon, a strainer (if using loose tea), and a ceramic bowl. Finally, if you intend to bottle your ink, you’ll need a small glass bottle with a screw-top lid.\n\n\nGum arabic can be found at most craft stores.\nEverything else may be found at a grocery store.",
                "Measure your tea. If your black tea is in mesh tea bags, you are going to use 4 of them. If you are using loose-leaf tea, you will need about 2 tbsp. Place the measured tea into a large ceramic bowl.[1]",
                "Boil water. For this recipe, you will need ½ to ¾ cups of boiling water. Place your water on the stove, or use an electric kettle to heat your water to boiling. It is a good idea to measure your water before heating it up, that way you reduce the risk of scalding yourself.",
                "Add boiling water to tea leaves. Take your boiling water (which has already been measured) and pour it carefully over your tea bags or tea leaves in the ceramic bowl.",
                "Stir. Using your wooden or metal spoon, swirl the boiling water with the tea leaves. This helps to evenly distribute the water and tea to create an even ink tone.",
                "Allow it to steep briefly. As this is only a preliminary “steep” before adding thickening agents (or other ingredients), you only need to allow 3-4 minutes of steeping. You want the tea to darken a bit, but you need the water to still be hot when you add the next ingredient. You may want to keep your water on low heat during this step.[2]",
                "Select the recipe you’d like to use. In order for your tea to be transformed into usable ink, you need to thicken the liquid. There are two schools of thought when it comes to thickening agents. Gum arabic is the more popular choice for ink recipes, although it may be harder for you to find. Another option is cornstarch, which may be slightly less effective, but you may have it in your cupboard at home.[3]",
                "Add gum arabic. If you have elected to use gum arabic, using your measuring spoon, measure out 1 tsp. of gum arabic. Add this to your hot water and stir to combine.[4]",
                "Add cornstarch. If you have chosen to use cornstarch instead of gum arabic, there is no specific measurement to follow. Begin by adding 2 tsp. of cornstarch to your hot tea and stirring vigorously. Continue to add 1 tsp. at a time until the ink reaches a nice, thick consistency.[5]",
                "Add vinegar. The addition of 1 tbsp. of white vinegar to your recipe works to fix the ink and create a stable, uniform color. If you have vinegar at home, consider adding this optional ingredient. Simply measure out 1 tbsp. of white vinegar, and add this to your tea, after the addition of a thickening agent. Stir well.[6]",
                "Add thyme essential oil. Another optional addition is that of thyme essential oil. Thyme essential oil prevents the growth of mold in your ink. If you intend to bottle your ink and to save it for a while, this may be an important addition. Essential oils can be found at most health food stores. (They tend to be a bit pricey, but will last you for a very long time).[7]",
                "Let it steep again. Allow your concoction to steep for 15-20 minutes. Leaving it to simmer on very low heat may result in a deeper hue. Set a timer and watch your tea darken and transform.[8]",
                "Release tannins. Using either the back of a spoon or your tea strainer, squeeze down the tea bags or tea leaves, removing all of the water. This works to release more tannins into the water, creating a richer ink.",
                "Remove tea. Strain the hot water into another bowl (or down the sink), in order to remove the tea leaves and/or tea bags. If using loose-leaf tea, you may want to repeat this step to ensure that all particles have been removed from your ink.",
                "Allow the ink to cool completely. Your ink is nearly done, however you will need to allow it to cool down completely before it will be ready to use. This cooling down time allows the color to set. Cool ink will also have a more dramatic effect on paper.[9]",
                "Test out the ink. Using a steel nib pen, dip pen, or quill pen, simply place the tip into your ink and begin writing. If you do not have a pen like this, you can make one by making a diagonal slice in the bottom of a plastic straw.[10]\n\nFountain pens should not be used, as this ink can damage them.",
                "Bottle the ink. Once cooled, your ink can be bottled. Using a small funnel, pour your ink into your small glass bottle. (If you do not have a funnel, you can make one out of thick paper.) Close the lid tightly and store your ink in a cool, dry place.[11]"

            "intro": "Do you want to impress your teacher? Maybe you just want to get the most out of your school year. Whatever your reason for wanting to be the best student in your class, there are a couple of different ways you're going to want to improve yourself. Being the best student in any class great is about more than just making the grade; it's also being a good person and showing your teacher that you take their class seriously.",
            "steps": [
                "Get your brain and body ready to learn. You will learn best and have the easiest time in school if your body is ready to learn! There are lots of things that you can do to get your body ready. Try:\n\n\nGet lots of sleep. You’ll need to get the right amount of sleep for your body if you want your brain to work at its best. You should feel alert through most of the day. If you find yourself needing to shut your eyes by lunch, you’re not sleeping enough. For most people, you’ll need about 8 hours of sleep.\nYour body can’t work right if all you eat is junk like chips, candy, and hamburgers. If you want to be the best student you can be, eat your vegetables (like broccoli), some fruit, and lean proteins (like chicken and fish).\nDrink plenty of water. Your brain needs water in order to work right. In fact, your whole body needs water in order to work right. Drink several glasses of water a day but keep in mind that some people need more water than others.",
                "Learn in a way that works for you. Everyone learns best in different ways; this is called a learning style.[1] Find a way that works for you and try to learn that way as much as you can. You’ll have more control over this when you study at home, but you can also talk to your teacher about adjusting how the lessons are taught to include more variety for different style learners.\n\n\nFor example, have you noticed that it’s really easy for you to remember charts or pictures? This means you might be a visual learner, which means you should use more images and pictures in order to learn. An example of this would be if you drew yourself a chart to memorize the parts of speech.\nMaybe you've noticed that you have an easier time studying when you listen to music quietly or that you can't remember what your teacher wrote on the board but you can \"hear\" what they said in your head as if they were in the room now. This means you might be an auditory learner, which means you learn better with sound. An example of this would be if you record your teacher when they're talking so that you can listen to it while you do your homework or study.\nMaybe you've noticed that, during a lesson, you feel like you still want to pay attention but you really need to stand up or move around. Maybe you pace around your room while you study. This might mean that you are a kinesthetic learner, which means you learn better when you're doing things with your body. Try playing with a piece of clay in your hand while your teacher talks.",
                "Pay attention. The best thing that you can do to become the best student in any class is pay attention when your teacher is talking. If you get distracted you might miss important information and you'll have a harder time understanding what to do or when you have to study later.\n\n\nIf you're having trouble staying focused when your teacher is talking, try sitting in the front and participating more in the class. Raise your hand and ask questions when you don't understand something or when your teacher says something interesting and you want to know more about it.",
                "Learn how to take notes. Taking notes (and taking notes well) can be tricky, but it will make it much easier for you to learn and study, which means your grades will get better and your test scores will improve so you're the best student in your class. Just remember, you don't have to write down everything your teacher says. Just write down the most important things and the things you know you'll have a hard time remembering.",
                "Do your homework on time and well. Even if you don't get very good grades on your homework, just doing it on time will help keep your grade up as much as possible. You should aim to make your homework marks the highest in the class or you're not really trying to be the best in your class. Beyond that, do as well on your homework as you can. When you don't understand it, ask someone for help! Your teacher might be able to set you up with a tutor or even help you themselves.\n\n\nSchedule enough time to actually get your homework done. This might mean watching less TV or spending less time with your friends but it will be worth it in the end.\nGetting a good environment to do homework will really help you to get it done. Go somewhere quiet where you don't have any distractions. If you can go to a library, that's a good spot. If you can't leave your house and the people you live with are noisy, try your bathroom.",
                "Look for extra ways to learn. Learning stuff that isn't included in your classes can help you understand the information you do cover a lot better and it can also really impress your teacher. Pursuing information in a way that follows your interests can also help you stay focused in class. Look for more ways to learn about all of the subjects you study and you'll find that all of school is more interesting and that you're more and more successful.\n\n\nFor example, if you're studying American history, you can watch documentaries online to learn even more about the era you're learning about.\nYou can learn by studying books from your local library and you can also learn a lot online. While Wikipedia isn't always accurate, it's usually pretty good. You can also find documentaries and educational videos on YouTube, like the popular shows Crash Course and TedTalks. These have a lot information that your teacher or professor didn't explain it well enough for you.\nLearn when school is out of session too. Keep learning during the summer, on the weekends, and start preparing for your next year of school as early as you can by finding out what kind of stuff you'll study. As for the summers, just reviewing the information you already learned for just two or three hours three or four times over the course of the whole summer can help make sure that you're ready when the school year starts.",
                "Study earlier. One of the most effective ways to get better scores on tests is to start studying and preparing for the test as early as possible. Definitely don't leave it until the night before. The harder the test will be, the earlier you should start studying. Two or three weeks is usually a good starting point.",
                "Make people feel good, not bad. Being the best student in a class is about more than just getting good grades. You should also work on being a good person. You don't want to be a bully or a class clown; that will not make you the best student in the class. Focus on making people feel good by giving them compliments and telling them when they do a good job. Don't be mean to people and tease them or say hurtful things.",
                "Be helpful to everyone. Be a good person by helping people when you can. If you know how to do something or you have an easier way of doing it, show them how. Don't make yourself seem smarter or better, just be nice and friendly. You can also do small nice things, like holding a door open for them or helping them carry something heavy.\n\n\nFor example, if someone was gone for a few days, offer to help them get caught up and share your notes with them.",
                "Be respectful to people, even when they're being mean. Even when people are mean to you, you should still be respectful. Don't shout at them or physically hurt them. Don't call them names or cut in front of them in line, just to spite them. Simply ignore them and treat them like you would treat anyone else.\n\n\nBe respectful to people by not talking over them and definitely giving them a chance to talk if they want to. Respect their opinions and don't worry if they think a little bit differently than you. You should also let people be themselves and don't make them feel bad for being unique or different.",
                "Stay calm. When you're in class, stay as calm as you can. Don't run around and disrupt people. You should also try not to get stressed when school gets tough. This is bad for you and it might also cause you to lash out at other people.\n\n\nHelp yourself calm down by breathing slowly. Remind yourself that everything will be okay. You're strong enough to do this!\nAvoid worrying about perfect grades. Perfect grades really only matter your last year and a half of high school and then when you're in college (if you plan on going to graduate school later). Otherwise, just focus on learning the material as well as you can and don't worry about the numbers or letters that your teacher assigns. Knowing the material is more important than getting a grade.",
                "Make things fun for everyone. Try to help everyone have fun. Be enthusiastic and positive when you're in class. This excitement to learn will make everyone feel more okay about learning. It might even get some people to show excitement when they wouldn't normally let other people see that they care.\n\n\nFor example, you might start learning about the planets in your science class. Find a cool picture of your favorite planet and show it to other people, then challenge them to find a cool picture of their favorite planet.",
                "Be yourself! Most importantly, be yourself. You can't be the best person you can possibly be if you're pretending to be someone else. Do the things that make you happy. Share the things that you love. Be friends with the people that get you and make you feel good about yourself. Don't worry about what other people think. The truth is that years from now, you won't even remember half of their names. If they don't think you're the coolest person now, you're not going to care in five or six years. What you will care about is how unhappy you are that you didn't do things that made you happy.",
                "Be respectful. If you want to make your teacher happy, being respectful is really the best way to start. Especially if other students are disrespectful, you'll stand out and quickly become their favorite. You can do things like:\n\n\nDon't be disruptive. Don't pass notes, talk to your friends, make jokes, or move around too much while your teacher is talking.\nBe punctual (on time or even early) and definitely don't skip their class.\nWhen you're talking to them, be polite. Address them as Ma'am or Sir and use words like please and thank you. Be serious when you use the words and don't let them feel like you're making fun of them by talking like this.",
                "Ask questions. Teachers like it when students ask questions. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, it tells them that you're paying attention. Second, it shows them that you think they're interesting and that you're enjoying the subject (even if you're not). Third, it makes them feel smart and helpful. Everyone likes to feel smart and helpful. Ask questions when you have them and you'll find your teacher liking you more and more.\n\n\nFor example, if your teacher is talking about chemistry and Avogadro's number, ask them how they memorize the number.\nAs a warning, however, try not to ask pointless questions. You don't want to ask a question just so you have a question to ask. Eventually, this will annoy your teacher and they'll think that you're doing it just for the attention.\nDo not ask personal questions or something that is important only to you. You can ask about homework, pop quiz dates or something that does not bother you alone or if you don't understand. \"What pages do we have to read for tomorrow?\" and \"Ma'am, is there a better method to memorize this?\" will be appropriate. \"Why did I get a D?\" and \" Ma'am, which boy band is the hottest according to you?\" are definite nos. \"Ma'am, do you have a boyfriend?\" type of questions which are related to personal relationships of teachers are not to be asked at any cost. Teachers get ticked due to this and can get you suspended.",
                "Ask for help. You might think that asking your teacher for help will make them mad because it makes you look stupid. This couldn't be further from the truth. Asking for help actually makes you look smart and it will make your teacher happy. When you ask questions, your teacher knows that you'll work hard and understand what they're teaching much better. They'll be proud of you for taking the initiative to get the help you know you need.\n\n\nFor example, if there's a math test coming up in a few weeks, and you know that you didn't fully understand how to divide fractions, then ask your teacher if they can go over the instructions with you one more time and do two or three problems with you until you understand it.\nSay something like, \"Mr. Green, I'm having a hard time with the homework. For some reason, the genitive case is just really hard for me to get. Can we maybe meet after school or during lunch, so you can try explaining it in a different way?\"",
                "Be a helpful student. Be a student that not only keeps out of trouble, but also makes the classroom a kinder place. This is about more than just starting fights and arguments (although you shouldn't do those things either). This is also about being a person that helps solves problems when they come up. For instance:\n\n\nYou remind others (without being bossy or rude) to keep to classroom rules.\nIf a fight breaks out, you immediately get the nearest teacher, or diffuse the fight, or whatever is appropriate to the situation.\nYou help the teacher with tasks such as handing out papers, materials, making copies, helping a student with a question, or whatever is appropriate.\nYou help classmates who are having problems. If a peer is clearly upset, you try to help him. You open the door for a teacher wheeling the AV cart. You do not pass on ugly rumors, even if it is juicy gossip.",
                "Stay on top of your work. Do your homework on time. Get study guides and ask for help at least two weeks before a test, and not two or three days before. Take notes. When your teacher sees you working hard, even if you're not the smartest and even if you don't get the best test scores, they'll still like you best."

            "intro": "If you have a new baby girl, you probably want to start developing a strong mother-daughter bond from the very beginning. Follow these steps to help construct a loving, close-knit relationship with your daughter from infancy.",
            "steps": [
                "Begin nursing your daughter in the hospital. Women have the most success with breastfeeding when they try to start exclusively breastfeeding in the hospital.\n\n\nIf you would like assistance or tips to make it more comfortable and to make sure you are producing enough milk, ask for help from a nurse or breastfeeding counselor while you are in the hospital.",
                "Try to breastfeed for at least 6 months. The bonding benefits of breastfeeding continue as long as you keep nursing your baby.\n\nConsider nursing through her entire first year to maintain a routine of cuddling and holding your baby so that she associates you with food, comfort, safety, and love.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Nurture the Mother Daughter Relationship from Infancy Step 2Bullet1\" src=\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Nurture-the-Mother-Daughter-Relationship-from-Infancy-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid1988140-v4-728px-Nurture-the-Mother-Daughter-Relationship-from-Infancy-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"485\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
                "Make grooming a mother-daughter experience. Share the bathing, hair combing, tooth brushing, dressing, and other grooming routines with your daughter.\n\n\nShowing her how to care for herself and establishing a routine during which she can count on your personal attention teaches her from a young age that you are there to take care of her.",
                "Let your daughter try to be like you. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and it also indicates that your daughter is trying to learn her cues for behavior from you. If your daughter tries to mimic your body language, activities, or routines, invite her to participate and to learn from you. However, keep in mind that she is an individual. Encourage her to participate in activities with you, but let her explore her own interests.\n\n\nSet good examples. If you have negative feelings toward your looks or body shape, you risk passing on these same issues to your daughter. Learn to embrace your size and your imperfections and teach her to love herself regardless of the often unrealistic media images presented on the \"perfect body\".\nAlways talk to your daughter openly about body image issues. Be honest about your own feelings and avoid being judgmental of how she looks. If you find it hard to talk about, there are excellent resources available in books and online for helping you approach body image and related issues with your daughter.",
                "Bring your daughter along for your favorite activities. If you love to jog, bring your daughter with you in a jogging stroller; if you love to shop, people-watch, garden, cook, or read, find ways to bring your daughter with you or help her to be a part of the action at your side.\n\n\nInvolve your daughter in chores early on, as a way to develop personal responsibility rather than enforcing an \"expected role.\" If you have sons, include them as well, doing the same amount of chores, so that your daughter and sons learn that chores are the shared responsibility of all householder, to ensure the smooth running of a household.",
                "Tell your daughter you love her often. Raising a daughter who is in no doubt of the fact that you love her accustoms her to a loving, supportive relationship with you; if she gets used to hearing and saying the words “I love you” from a young age, she will know that your love is one thing she never has to worry about losing.",
                "Give your daughter physical tokens of affection. Especially while your daughter is an infant, cover her with kisses, embrace her on a regular basis, and incorporate cuddle time into your regular nap time routine. As she grows older, never stop hugging her, in both the good times and the bad. The power of touch remains important throughout your lives together.\n\n\nThese physical expressions of love not only teach your daughter how to show and accept affection, but they also accustom her to a relationship with her mother that values regular hugs and kisses.\nAs a bonus, physical affection will release more oxytocin, cementing your mother-daughter bond with chemical reinforcement.",
                "Listen and stay engaged. Your daughter will know the difference between attentive listening and making a pretense at listening. If you cannot set aside time to listen to something she has to say at a certain moment, suggest making a time when you will be free to sit down and talk, and then make good on that. Let her know that what she has to say is valued and that you will always make the time for her.",
                "Make your daughter feel special. Even if you have other children, it is essential to spend alone time with each child on a regular basis so that they know how much you value them as an individual.\n\n\nCarve out time to play one-on-one with your baby girl however she likes, as often as possible, and treat her to little surprise kisses or signs of affection.\nAs your daughter ages, take her on mother-daughter shopping days, haircut days, or other activities that allow the 2 of you to spend time in just each other’s company on a regular basis.",
                "Share your life with her. When something good happens at work, dance with your daughter to celebrate. If someone passes away in the family, talk to your daughter and grieve with her.\n\n\nSharing your emotions and experiences with your daughter teachers her that you value her in good times and in bad, and shows her that your mother-daughter bond is strong enough to share in triumphs as well as in sorrows."

            "intro": "While bacon should only be refrigerated for up to seven days,[1] you can prolong the freshness of your bacon by freezing it. However, if you freeze the entire package, you’ll need to thaw and cook the entire package, too! For those times when you need a couple slices of bacon for your dinner recipe or are craving just one slice (or two… or three…) to go with your morning eggs, here are a couple methods for freezing bacon individually.",
            "steps": [
                "Cut a long strip of wax paper. You want to have enough wax paper to spread out your entire package of bacon with a couple inches between each piece.[2] You can also use parchment paper.[3]",
                "Lay your wax paper on your counter. Be sure your counter is clean and free of crumbs.",
                "Place your bacon on the wax paper. With your fingers or tongs, place one piece of bacon on one end of the wax paper.[4] Smooth the bacon flat.",
                "Wrap your bacon.[5] Grab the other end of the wax paper and pull it toward your bacon until it touches the edge of the slice you just laid down. Create a crease so that your bacon stays put.\n\n\nYour first slice of bacon is now covered with wax paper on both sides.",
                "Add another slice of bacon. Place it directly on top of the wax paper covering the top of your first slice.[6]",
                "Repeat your fold.[7] Pull the end of your wax paper that is free of bacon back over the top of your second slice of bacon.\n\n\nYou are essentially creating an accordion fold around each slice of bacon so that they are individually wrapped.[8]\n\nContinue this process until all your bacon is folded into the wax paper.",
                "Place your bacon in a freezer bag. [9] Place your wax paper-wrapped bacon stack in the bottom of the bag and use your arm to flatten the rest of the bag against the counter. Be sure to squeeze all the air out of the bag.[10]\n\nWrite the date on your freezer bag so that you remember how long you have stored it.",
                "Freeze.[11] There’s no need to deep freeze your bacon, just be sure that your freezer is set at zero degrees.[12]",
                "Prepare a baking sheet. Line your baking sheet with a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. The lined baking sheet will serve as your surface for creating and freezing your bacon rolls.",
                "Create your rolls. You can lay your bacon onto your prepared baking sheet or roll your bacon as you pull it out of the package. Begin on one end of the bacon strip and roll it until the entire piece is wrapped around itself.[13]",
                "Place your rolls on your baking sheet. Be sure that the end of your bacon roll is on the bottom so that the bacon doesn’t uncoil. Your bacon will resemble the shape of a snail.[14]\n\nBe sure that the bacon rolls aren’t touching each other.",

Once your bacon has frozen into the rolls, you can take them off the baking pan, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and put them back in the freezer immediately.[16]\n\nYou can now use your bacon as needed. You won’t need to pry frozen bacon off of wax paper, and the bacon strips will only be frozen to themselves (not each other).[17]",
                "Prepare a baking sheet. This method also requires that you line your baking sheet with a piece of wax paper or parchment paper. The lined baking sheet will serve as your surface for laying out and freezing your bacon slices.[18]",
                "Place your bacon on the baking sheet in a single layer. You don’t need to leave a lot of space between each slice, but be sure the sides of your bacon are not touching.[19]",
                "Add another layer. If have more bacon than fits on your baking sheet, you can add another sheet of wax paper on top of your first layer of bacon. Then you can finish spreading out your bacon on top of that second sheet of wax paper.[20]",
                "Freeze your bacon. Place your baking sheet in the freezer.[21] Wait until the bacon is frozen solid.",
                "Separate your bacon. Once your bacon is frozen on your baking sheet, pull off the slices of bacon from your wax paper, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag, and put them back in the freezer immediately.",
                "Grab the bacon last. At the supermarket, be sure that your bacon is the very last item you select before checking out.[22] If you pick up your bacon at the beginning of your supermarket trip, it’s potentially developing bacteria while you are checking the other items off your list.",
                "Freeze immediately. Do not use previously opened bacon that has already been stored in your fridge. Cured meats like bacon can spoil or develop bacteria at temperatures higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit[23], so be sure to prepare your bacon for individual freezing immediately after purchasing it.[24]",
                "Wash your hands. While this step might seem obvious, it’s still important. Even beyond washing your hands before and after you prepare your bacon, you should also wash your hands at any point after touching the bacon and before touching any supplies.\n\n\nFor instance, if you need to grab some more wax paper or a freezer bag, don’t forget to wash your hands first. Otherwise, your roll of wax paper or box of storage bags will be contaminated.",
                "Disinfect your counter top. It’s important to disinfect both before and after you prepare your bacon for freezing. Any bacteria that is on your counter can be transferred to the wax paper and onto your bacon.",
                "Check the date. Be sure to check the “use by” date and the number of days recommended for refrigeration, as well. While freezing keeps your bacon fresher longer, you should definitely freeze your bacon prior to the expiration date. Likewise, if you needed to store the bacon in your fridge before freezing it, be sure to freeze it before the end of the suggested refrigeration period,[25] which is seven days.[26]\n\nThe longer bacon is stored, the less flavorful it will be. For best quality, store your bacon in the freezer for no more than one month.[27] Three months is the recommended maximum storage time.[28]",
                "Use your bacon immediately after thawing it. Always thaw food in the refrigerator or in cold water. If using cold water, replace the water at 30 minute intervals. Do not thaw bacon at room temperature.[29]"

        "How to Fight Your HOA (Homeowner Association)": {
            "intro": "A Homeowners Association (HOA) is usually a non-profit organization created to operate and maintain a residential community. Most HOAs are governed by a member-elected Board of Directors, who must follow the HOA’s internal rules.[1] These rules are typically outlined in the HOA’s governing documents, which can be in the form of bylaws, articles of incorporation, covenants, guidelines, and/or other HOA adopted policies. Because the HOA Board has the power to enforce these rules as they see fit, it can sometimes overstep its authority, attempting to enforce the rules in an arbitrary or unfair way. In these cases, fighting the HOA might be the appropriate course of action.",
            "steps": [
                "Understand your relationship to the HOA. Generally, when a home (or lot) that is part of an HOA is purchased, the buyer automatically becomes a member of the HOA. As a member, the homeowner must comply with the rules of HOA membership, including payment of HOA dues and following all conditions and restrictions in the community.\n\n\nWhile the HOA’s primary function is to protect and maintain the value of both the private and communal property in the community, the actions of the HOA’s board and its interpretation and application of the HOA’s rules sometimes cause problems for individual homeowners. Are you allowed to put up a storage shed? Can you paint your house a different color? Does your tree need to be pruned? Can you park your R.V. in the driveway? The HOA probably has rules applicable to each of these circumstances.",
                "Review your HOA's rules. Different states have different requirements for what documents the HOA must maintain as part of the HOA’s rules. Most frequently those documents include: (1) the Articles of Incorporation, (2) the Bylaws, and (3) the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions. These documents collectively describe the powers, limits, and obligations of the HOA.\n\n\nThese documents also usually include a description of how the rules can be amended, how the HOA board is elected (or removed), what powers the board holds, how meetings are called, and the consequences of any violations of the HOA rules by the members.\nThe Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&R) document outlines the rules for community members, such as how they maintain the outsides of their homes and what they can, and cannot, do in public inside the community.\nThe HOA’s rules operate much like a contract between the HOA and each individual member-homeowner. Any breach of the contract could be grounds for legal action. One of the remedies available to the HOA for the homeowner’s breach of the HOA rules is foreclosure against the homeowner’s property.",
                "Understand the duties and responsibilities of the HOA board. In general, the Board of Directors is responsible for managing all matters concerning the homeowners peaceful enjoyment of their homes and the common areas of the residential community. The Board may delegate daily management functions to an outside property management service, however, ultimate control and responsibility remains with the Board.\n\n\nThe Board’s powers and duties to all homeowners within the HOA include enforcing the rules governing the ownership and management of the residential community, paying all taxes and assessments and avoiding liens upon the common area, securing general liability insurance on behalf of the HOA, securing contracts for materials and services in order to maintain the common area, electing and/or organizing committees, officers, or employees of the HOA, and overseeing the preparation of budgets and financial statements on behalf of the HOA, .\nThey are also responsible for writing all rules of operation for the common areas and facilities within the HOA and notifying all homeowners of these rules on a regular basis, notifying homeowners of any violation of the rules and conducting investigative meetings and/or disciplinary proceedings against members of the association for violations of the rules, and placing a lien on any homeowner’s property when timely payment of dues and assessments are not made.",
                "Understand your duties. Owning a home that is managed within a HOA obligates you to accept and follow the HOA's rules. The CC&R sets the rules and responsibilities of living within your residential community and enjoying the common areas within the development maintained by the HOA.\n\n\nHomeowners must follow all written rules set forth within the CC&R, for example, parking restrictions, home maintenance, home improvement, and prohibited conduct.\nHomeowners must pay all fees and assessments on a monthly basis to contribute to the cost of repairing and maintaining the common areas within the residential community.\nHomeowners cannot refuse to pay any fees and assessments, however, a member has the right to take action against the HOA in order to contest any unwarranted charges.",
                "Determine the nature of your action or conflict. If you are in a dispute with your HOA can be because the HOA is taking action against you or because you are taking action against the HOA. If the HOA is taking action against you, it is typically in order to collect past dues and fines. If you are taking action against your HOA it is usually in order to ask a court to require the HOA to perform the responsibilities it is obliged to perform under the rules. For example, to approve your reasonable request for improvements to your home.",
                "Review the HOA rules. If your board does not provide you with a specific section of the rules that you are breaking, you will need to find it. Sometimes, the rules do not say what the HOA’s Board members think they say. Look for general or ambiguous language. (Or, for that matter, completely absent or omitted language.) In some cases, different sections in the HOA documents internally conflict, i.e. say opposite things regarding the same issue.[2]",
                "Document your actions. In general, keep copies of emails, letters, bills, and warnings from the HOA. If you have a conversation with anyone acting as a representative of the HOA, be sure to write down your understanding of the conversation in the form of a confirmation letter, and mail a copy of that letter to the HOA. This gives the HOA an opportunity to correct anything you might have misheard. If the HOA does not correct your understanding, as set forth in your letter, the statements in your letter could serve as strong evidence of what was actually said.\n\n\nIf the HOA has routinely violated or ignored the rules in the past, while presently seeking to enforce a rule against you arbitrarily, you will be able to document that the HOA is not treating you fairly and reasonably.[3] This is showing how the HOA has dealt with your similar issue in the past.\nAs a member, if you were granted an exception to the HOA Rules, be sure to document that exception in writing, specifying precisely what was granted, who granted it, when, and for what time period. Some such exceptions might need to be recorded with your county recorder’s office in the same way as your property deed.\nTo avoid keeping heaps of paper, simply scan these documents and keep electronic copies, ensuring that you have adequate file backups in case of a computer malfunction, burglary, or catastrophic loss.",
                "Make sure your HOA has updated and amended their rules recently. This includes incorporating your state’s current HOA governing statutes. If not, your HOA Rules may be found to be unenforceable by the court. For instance, a number of states have enacted laws governing flags and solar panels placed upon structures and the Federal Communications Commission governs the placement of antennas and satellite dishes.[4]",
                "Pay your fines and dues. Pay your fines (and/or dues) now, and contest them later. If you ignore the HOA’s bills, not only will they begin to add up, but they likely will begin to accumulate additional late fees, penalties, and/or interest. The HOA usually has the power (and likely the will and ability) to place a lien on your property and even to foreclose on the property in order to collect the fines.\n\n\nIf you are successful in your fight against the HOA, you likely will be able to get your payments refunded with interest.\nRemember, however, to make an effort to negotiate a resolution of fines and/or collection disputes between you and your HOA or its lawyer. Your HOA may be incentivized to settle your matter in order to avoid future expensive attorney fees.",
                "Connect With Your Neighbors. If you are having an issue with your HOA, your neighbors might be having the same issue with the HOA. They can help to advise, support, and strengthen your fight. The more that members join together, the more likely the HOA will back down.\n\n\nIt could be useful to gather signatures of neighbors who agree with you into a petition. As a unified group, you can more easily make positive changes by convincing board members to vote for specific changes to the rules or by voting in (or out) board members.",
                "Attend regular HOA board meetings. The best proactive measure you can take when challenging an action your HOA has taken against you is to regularly attend and participate in HOA board meetings. Being present and knowing what actions the board is planning to take, and discovering past actions the board has taken, will alert and inform you of what you can expect as a challenging homeowner.\n\n\nHOA Board meetings can show you how the HOA addresses specific issues. Therefore, requesting copies of the minutes of a prior board meeting that addressed a similar circumstance will help you in laying a foundation in court that the HOA is treating you unfairly and being unreasonable.",
                "Remember that most Board Members are unpaid volunteers. If you treat them with respect and kindness, you likely will get closer to your own goal. Remain professional, write well-reasoned letters, and speak politely in a cool, collected tone. While it may feel good to contemplate kicking in the door to a board meeting and calling the board members a variety of names, it will not help your cause. Instead, simply convey your position, any evidence you have to support your position, and what you actually want the HOA to do for you.\n\n\nThis is not to say that you should avoid a show of strength. In fact, it is a good idea to make sure the HOA board knows that you intend to advance your position. Just be respectful.",
                "Request a hearing. Write a professional letter respectfully asking for a hearing on your issue. Attend the hearing with multiple copies of your evidence and/or a signed petition showing neighborhood support. When you speak, keep it factual. While you may feel anger and frustration, keep your statement clear, concise, and professional.\n\n\nYou might also consider filing a grievance with the HOA against specific individuals in the HOA (or under the HOA’s control) who are harassing you, randomly and capriciously enforcing regulations against you, or otherwise treating you poorly.\nIn your written request for a hearing, request copies of the HOA’s records that were used as a basis for the HOA action against you, or the denial of your request for improvements to your property. However, some executive sessions of the HOA board meetings may be able to be held back from you, so check the rules.",
                "Change the HOA rules or the board members. Oftentimes you can remove a troublesome board member by as little as 10% of members voting for such a recall. You can also try to amend the rules, though this process likely would require a substantial effort. However, if you can “sell” a change in the rules to fellow members as something that would benefit them (rather than simply helping you personally to avoid a fine), you might be able to gather the required support.\n\n\nAnother, easier alternative to amending the rules would be to apply for a “variance.” This is, essentially, a request for an exception to the rules for your particular case. For example, perhaps you have a medical condition that requires a large handicapped-accessible van be parked in front of your home but parking vehicles long term on the street is usually restricted. The HOA might make an exception (grant a variance) in your case either as a gesture of good will or in order to avoid a lawsuit.",
                "Think Outside the Box. Remember that internal hearings or meetings are not the only ways to fight the HOA. For instance, if you can attract the attention of local media, you might cause your HOA to “give in” to community pressure.",
                "Consider if your conflict should be taken to court. Some causes of action you may consider in bringing a small claims action are: Is the HOA acting arbitrarily and capriciously against you by preventing you from exercising your rights as a homeowner? Is the HOA discriminating against you based upon race, religion, or sexual orientation? Is the HOA misappropriating funds? Is the HOA neglecting their duties to repair and maintain the common areas? Does the HOA fail to notify members of meetings?\n\n\nEven small claims actions can be emotionally difficult, financially draining, and long-lasting. Remember, also, that the Board Members of the HOA you are suing probably are your neighbors, which can make your daily life even more difficult.\nFurther, if you lose, your HOA rules may require you to pay the HOA’s legal fees, which easily exceed any damages you are claiming in your action. Although you may prevail in your action, the HOA might still be able to pass at least a part of their legal costs (and, even the damages award they’re ordered to pay you) back to you through a special assessment where all members must contribute a sum to the HOA (which won’t help you make friends with your neighbors).\nCourts often apply the standard of “reasonableness” when determining whether or not a HOA’s action against a homeowner is enforceable by court order. If the court determines that the HOA’s action or fine against a homeowner is not more likely than not unreasonable, it could find in your favor and reverse the action or fine imposed against you.",
                "Watch for discrimination. If the HOA is citing and fining you, but not other members for the same infractions, it potentially is acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner, which opens the door for lawsuits based on discrimination. For instance, if you are denied permission to build a pool, but other neighbors have been allowed to do so, it is worth the effort to catalogue which neighbors, the location of their pools, and the approximate dates your neighbors installed their pools. If you can show that your denial was based on a “protected characteristic” such as your race, gender, national origin, religious belief, marital status, etc. you are well on your way to winning your fight against the HOA.\n\n\nCourts may find against HOAs when their actions fail to be fair and uniformly applied to all homeowners and you do not necessarily need to prove that they discriminated against you based upon a protected class. If you can show that your HOA treated you differently than it did other homeowners in your similar circumstance, its case against you will be weakened dramatically in the court’s eyes. Some states, such as Arizona, have a separate administrative process specifically designed to handle HOA disputes.",
                "Consult a lawyer. You should consider retaining a lawyer. Doing so does not necessarily mean filing a lawsuit will be necessary. The mere presence of a lawyer in the mix often can cause the HOA to reconsider its position. Further, a lawyer can give you valuable advice regarding your strategy, can send letters and demands on your behalf, and can represent your interests in an ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) process or in litigation.\n\n\nHire someone with experience in handling HOA disputes. This might not necessarily be a real estate lawyer. HOAs are not-for-profit organizations similar to corporations, which is a different thing entirely from typical real estate issues. Your local Bar Association can often give excellent recommendations and referrals.",
                "File a small claims action. In the event you are unable to resolve your dispute with the HOA (for example, the HOA has imposed a fine against your that is not fair or within the rights of the board), the next option you may consider is to file a small claims action in municipal (magistrate) court.\n\n\nMost small claims jurisdictions are limited to damages of up to $10,000 and/or an order for specific performance against the HOA.\nYou can bring a cause of action against the board claiming that it acted wrongfully and, as a result, you have suffered a financial loss.\nIf you are successful in small claims court against the HOA, the court can order the HOA to reimburse you for the amount of fine you were wrongfully required to pay as well as your court costs.\nPersonally visit your local clerk of court’s office or visit its website to obtain instructions and forms on how to proceed with your action."

But remember they are often fleeting, and some people mask them well.[2][3]\n\nHappiness is exhibited by a raising or lowering of the corners of the mouth.\nSadness is shown by a lowering of the corners of the mouth and by the raising of the inner portions of one’s eyebrows.\nSurprise can be seen when eyebrows arch, eyes open wide to expose more white area, and when the jaw drops slightly.\nFear is revealed through the raising of eyebrows, when eyes open after being shut or narrowed, and when the mouth opens slightly.\nDisgust is displayed when the upper lip raises, the bridge of the nose wrinkles, and cheeks raise.\nAnger exhibits itself when eyebrows lower, lips press together firmly, and eyes bulge.[4]",
                "Know what eye movements mean. Many believe that eyes are the windows to the soul. This belief drove many psychological and cognitive researchers to investigate if our involuntary eye movements held meaning. Research has shown our eyes make predictable movements when a person is processing a thought or question. The notion that you can tell if someone is lying based upon the direction of his or her eye movement, however, is a myth. Here’s what we do know.[5]\n\nEye movements in any direction increase when a person is recalling information.\nOur eye movements stop when something interests us. We also avert our gaze when thinking through something, such as the answer to a question. And our eyes stop moving when we’re trying to shut out distractions and focus.\nEyes move from left to right (or vice versa) when we are either problem-solving or processing and recalling information. And the harder the problem the more your eyes move.[6][7]\n\nEyes blink at a normal rate of 6-8 times per minute. When a person is under stress, that number rises dramatically.\nRaised eyebrows not only show fear but also genuine interest in a topic. Furrowed eyebrows signal confusion.[8]",
                "Look at the way a person’s mouth moves. Researchers say the mouth’s movements reveal a great deal about how a person feels. Pursing your lips, for example, is a sign of anger.[9] Happiness, as discussed, is displayed when the corners of the mouth curve up. However, researchers have found that different smiles mean different things.\n\n\nNatural, spontaneous smiles appear gradually, last briefly and are shown repetitively.\nGenuine delight is expressed by a series of short smile “bursts” and creases that form at the corners of the eyes.\nFake smiles are about 10 times larger than natural, spontaneous ones. They also appear suddenly, last longer than a natural smile, and disappear abruptly.[10]",
                "Observe head movements. A person tilts his or her head when actively listening to a topic that interests him or her. Nodding your head indicates you are interested in the topic and want the other person to continue talking. And rubbing one’s forehead or earlobes indicates a person feels uneasy, nervous or vulnerable.[11][12]",
                "Watch hand and arm movements. People move their hands and arms more than normal when they are speaking or answering a question.[13] They also touch both things and other people more when they respond to intimate questions or when they are physically close to others. [14]\n\nHiding your hands, like in your pockets or behind your back, can indicate deceit.\nCrossing your arms doesn’t always indicate anger, but it can be a defensive posture. It can also mean you feel uneasy with the other person. [15]",
                "Notice body posture and movements. Learning toward another person is a relaxed and interested indicator. Friendly feelings exist. Leaning in too close, on the other hand, can be experienced as a hostile or dominating gesture. Angling yourself toward another person while you're both standing signals respect. It's also often a sign of deference.[16]\n\nAdopting postures similar to others tends to increase group or interpersonal rapport. It tells others you are open to their thoughts.[17]\n\nStanding with your legs wide apart is either a traditional stance for those in positions of power or a dominating position.[18]\n\nA slumped posture indicates boredom, alienation or feeling ashamed.\nAn upright posture asserts confidence, but it also can exude hostility or a sense of uprightness.[19]",
                "Relax and become aware of what you’re hearing. Studies show that talking elevates a person’s blood pressure. Listening brings it back down. Listening relaxes us, which allows us to pay attention to our surroundings (and those in it).[20] Perceptive listening goes beyond actively listening, which focuses on listening to another person, reflecting on what he or she says, and sharing your thoughts.\n\n\nIt also requires you to think about what the other person is thinking and how he or she acts while talking.[21]\n\nIt demands focus and being mindful of and present in the conversation by paying close attention to cues from the other person and providing feedback relevant to the discussion.",
                "Remember that listening requires interpretation. The need to interpret information limits people in their ability to understand what a message means. These interpretations are often dictated by a person’s life experiences. Therefore, they are also limited by these experiences.\n\n\nThis leaves a lot of room for error in understanding what another person means.[22]",
                "Master perceptive listening. Listening is not an involuntary, automatic response to hearing what someone is saying. It involves a conscious effort on your part and requires practice. Foremost is that you respect the speaker as a human being who deserves to be heard. An effective listener will validate and empower others. This improves the relationship and often leads to future discussions that are straight forward and detailed. Here are some tips to being a more effective listener.\n\n\nFocus your attention, shut out distractions and listen closely to what’s said. You cannot assess a statement's logic or the speaker’s true intentions if you're unfocused.[23]\n\nRespond to what’s said so the speaker feels heard and believes you understand what he or she is saying. This feedback also allows you to clear up any misinterpretations in your processing.\nDon’t interrupt when providing feedback. Wait for natural breaks in the conversation and for cues from the speaker, such as “Does that make sense?”\nAsk questions at appropriate times to draw out what the speaker might not have said otherwise.[24]\n\nPay attention to the speaker’s mannerisms and tone, and what they might mean. Consider the context within which the message is delivered and observe what is not said. Meaning is not always openly expressed.[25]\n\nDon’t fill silences simply to avoid them. Give the person time to think through what he or she is thinking and wants to say.\nBe open-minded to messages that you do not agree with (e.g., prejudicial comments and opposing viewpoints). Allow the speaker to fully explain him or herself.\nSeek to understand and interpret a message’s meaning by using the cues you’ve been paying attention to and by drawing on your experiences.\nMake a conscious and active effort to remember what’s said. Retaining information is necessary for assessing its relationship to other aspects of the conversation – in the moment. It’s also needed to later process the information, which alone can alter your perception and handling of related situations.[26]",
                "Avoid roadblocks that prevent perceptive listening. Try not to ask “why” questions because this can make people feel defensive. Avoid advising the person about what you think should be done unless you’re asked. Don’t make quick reassurances, such as, “Don’t worry about that.” The latter can indicate you're not fully listening or taking the discussion seriously.[27]",
                "Practice perceptive listening in other areas of your life. Listen to the sounds around you and observe how they make you feel. Notice when you aren’t noticing sounds and stop, close your eyes, relax and focus. The more you do this, the more you will become aware of the world around you. This will also help you detect odd, unusual and pleasing sounds and become more perceptive about their meanings, in addition to the situations that might accompany them.[28]",
                "Understand intuition and its role in your life. Most people have, at some point, experienced a “gut feeling.” It seems to arise from nowhere but is quite distinct. Gut feelings make people feel in any number of ways. They can also cause a person to sense and know things without any logical explanation. And, at times, they spur a person to do things he or she might not otherwise. [29]\n\nThe famous psychotherapist, Carl Jung, said that all people use intuition as one of the four ways we function in life. The other three are feeling, thinking and sensing. This makes intuition distinct and not determined by the others.[30]\n\nEven though many people dismiss intuition as being either nonsense or luck, scientists are now saying it’s a very real ability that's been identified in lab settings and on bran scans.[31]",
                "Discover traits of the intuitive person. Researchers say that everyone is born with intuition, but not everyone is open to believing in it or willing to listen to it. And some people are more intuitive than others. That may be because they were naturally born with a heightened awareness. It could be because they’ve seen it work in their lives. And it might be because, along the way, they learned to notice and pick up on subtle cues from others and the environment.\n\n\nOften those who are very intuitive are also particularly people-focused. They are more easily able to sense what others are feeling.\nThey’re generally more emotionally oriented than analytical.\nThey frequently make decisions quickly and efficiently. They're able to do this because they use past experiences and emotions to guide them.\nWomen are often more intuitive than men.[citation needed] This could be the result of an evolutionary process that's made women particularly conscious of human responses and social stimuli.\nAnd there is evidence that some people can go a step beyond what's even normal in this realm. There's documentation of people knowing events have occurred far away, even though they have no prior knowledge of the event or factual basis to explain how they knew.[32]",
                "Recognize some of the signs. Scientific studies have shown that highly intuitive people experience changes in their heart rate and get sweaty palms when they are exposed to deceit. They believe it is a response to the stress of subconsciously knowing or suspecting they were being tricked. This seems to indicate that our instincts kick in and cause physical sensations first. Our minds catch up quickly, but second.[33]",
                "Learn to become more intuitive. Though intuition varies, there are things you can do to become more intuitive if you practice and have an open mind. The most basic way is to still (calm) your mind so you can a) listen to your inner voice and b) learn to be more observant of your environment and the people in it.\n\n\nPay attention to sensations that seem to come out of the blue and have no logical explanation. Our brain’s amygdala, which generates the fight-or-flight instinct, is able to activate, process and respond to cues and information before we are consciously aware they exist. It can also process images (and initiate our response to them) that pass before our eyes so fast that we cannot even see them.\nResearchers believe this stems from our very ancient ancestors' need to quickly gather and assess information if they wanted to survive.\nGet plenty of REM sleep. During REM, our brains problem solve, connect pieces of information and are most in tune with emotions.\nBefore you go to sleep, write down a problem or worry you have. Think about it for a bit, and then let your brain come up with an intuitive solution during REM.\nDistract your conscious mind so your intuitive mind has a chance to do its work. Research shows that our intuitive mind processes information even when we’re not consciously paying attention to that information.\nIn fact, the decisions a person makes when distracted have been shown to often be the correct ones. If you have a problem or concern, think through your options. Then stop and concentrate on something else. Go with the first solution that comes to you.[34]",
                "Check your gut decisions against the facts. Growing scientific evidence supports the wisdom of many intuitive decisions. Issues such as extreme distress can distort that intuitive processing, though, and lead to bad decision-making. Gut reactions and hunches are not always accurate. A smart approach is to listen to your gut and, at the same time, evaluate what it's telling you against the evidence.\n\n\nAlso factor in your emotions. Were they extreme when you got the gut feeling?[35]",
                "Meditate to improve perception. Buddhists have been practicing meditation for more than 2,500 years. Now roughly 10% of Americans meditate as well. Several studies have been conducted showing that meditation can significantly improve perception. Participants in one study were able to detect small visual variations. They had abnormally long attention spans as well.[36] Another demonstrated that the regions in the brain associated with a) sensitivity to body signals and b) sensory processing have increased grey matter when a person regularly meditates.[37]\n\nGrey matter is a type of tissue in the Central Nervous System that processes information and triggers a sensory response to it.[38]\n\nIt is believed that meditating creates more neural connections in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This region processes sensory information, handles rational decision-making and regulates the amygdala.\nTeaching yourself to relax, to tune things out, and to be receptive – rather than reactive – to the moment enhances your ability to receive cues around you.[39]",
                "Learn about the types of meditation. Meditation is an umbrella term for the ways you can achieve a relaxed state of being. Different types of meditation have different meditative processes. Here are some of the most widely practiced types of meditation.\n\n\nGuided meditation is led by a teacher, therapist or guide who talks you through visualizing images of people, places, things and experiences that you find relaxing.\nMantra meditation involves repeating a calming word, thought or phrase to prevent distracting thoughts from entering your mind.\nMindfulness meditation asks that you focus on the present moment and your breathing. Observe your thoughts and emotions without judging them harshly.\nQi gong combines meditation, physical movement, breathing exercises and relaxation to restore balance in your thinking.\nTai chi is a form of the Chinese martial arts, but movements and postures are slow. You need to also focus on deep breathing.\nTranscendental meditation involves silently repeating a personal mantra – a word, sound or phrase – to get your body into a state of deep relaxation. Here your mind can strive for inner peace.\nYoga is the practice of performing a series of postures and breathing exercises to create a more flexible body and a calm mind. Going from one pose to another requires concentration and balance. Therefore, the emphasis is on thinking only of the present moment.[40]",
                "Discover ways to practice it daily. You can practice meditation on your own at any point in the day. You don't need a formal class. The length of time you meditate is not as important as doing it regularly, and to the point of relaxation.\n\n\nBreathe deeply and slowly through your nose. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale. When your mind wanders, focus back on your breathing.\nScan your body and become aware of any sensations you feel. Focus your attention on different parts of your body. Combine this with breathing exercises to relax each part of your body.\nCreate your own mantra and repeat it throughout the day.\nWalk slowly, anywhere, and focus on the movement of your legs and feet. Repeat action words in your mind, such as “lifting” or “moving,\" as you place one foot in front of another.\nPray in spoken or written form using your own words or those written by others.\nRead poetry or books that are sacred to you, and then reflect on the meaning of what you read. You can also listen to music or spoken words that are inspiring or relaxing. Afterward, write down your reflections or discuss them with another, if you choose.\nFocus on a sacred object or being and think loving, compassionate and grateful thoughts. You can also close your eyes and visualize the object or being.[41]"

        "wikiHow to Make Tab Top Curtains": {
            "intro": "Tab top curtains have evenly spaced fabric tabs attached to the top, and these tabs are how the curtain attaches to the rod. As far as DIY projects are concerned, making tab top curtains is quite simple, and a basic set of curtains only requires the fabric and a sewing machine (or a needle and thread if you don’t have a machine). There are many materials you can use and a great number of patterns and designs to choose from, so you can make your curtains according to your taste and the décor of your home. There are some basic measurements and calculations you have to do before you can cut the fabric, but overall making your own tab top curtains is pretty straightforward!",
            "steps": [
                "Decide how many curtains you need. For a small window, you may only need one curtain to cover the whole thing. However, if you're covering a larger window, you may want two curtains that part in the middle. For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels.\n\n\nWhen you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 ÷ 3 = 10).",
                "Choose a fabric. You have a lot of choice when it comes to choosing fabrics for curtains, but you should take into account what kind of effect you want to achieve. For instance:[1]\n\nTo add a bit of privacy without blocking out too much light, choose a lighter weight material that has some transparency, such as voile or linen.\nTo block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask.\nFor an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don’t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza.",
                "Measure and calculate the width of the fabric. Measure the width of the window you're covering from the outer edge of the frame on one side to the outer edge of the frame on the other side. Multiply that by two or 2.5, depending on how full you want the closed curtains to look. Then add another four inches (101 mm) for the side hem.[2]\n\nIf you are making multiple panels, add four inches (101 mm) to each panel for the side hem.",
                "Measure the gap between the curtain rod and the window frame. Measure from the top of the curtain rod to the very top of the window frame. This is important because you want to ensure your curtains completely cover the top of the window. Therefore, when hung over the curtain rod, the finished tabs must be shorter than this gap.[3]",
                "Measure and calculate the length of the fabric. First, measure the distance from the top of the curtain rod to the spot where you want the finished curtain to end.[4] Add nine inches (228 mm) to that measurement to account for the hems,[5] and then subtract four inches (101 mm) to account for the tabs.[6] In general, curtains will hang to one of four locations:[7]\n\nRight to the floor, which is for formal or classy rooms.\nTo the floor plus an extra one to six inches (depending on taste), for a stylish and romantic effect.\nTo the top of the bottom window sill, which is ideal for kitchens and bathrooms.\nTo the bottom of the window trim, which is also great for practical areas like kitchens.",
                "Determine how many tabs you'll need. You need one tab at each end of the curtain, and then in between you should have a tab every five to eight inches.[8] To figure out how many tabs you need, divide the finished width of your curtain by the spacing measurement of your tabs, then add one.\n\n\nFor instance, if you have a finished curtain of 30 inches, and you want tabs spaced at every five inches, you need seven tabs for that curtain (30 ÷ 5 + 1 = 7).",
                "Calculate the length of your tab facing. When you sew the tabs on your curtains, you'll be left with a raw edge that you'll cover with a piece of facing. To make this, cut out a piece of fabric that’s four inches (101 mm) wide and the length of your curtains plus two inches (51 mm).[9]",
                "Measure and cut your fabric. Once you have all your measurements and calculations, you can cut your fabric to those dimensions and begin sewing. Don’t forget to cut out the curtains, the tabs, and the tab facing.\n\nFor a basic tab, cut out rectangles of fabric that are five inches by nine inches (127 mm by 228 mm). This will leave you with tabs that are two inches by eight inches (203 mm), and folded tabs that are four inches (101 mm) long.[10]",
                "Sew the tabs. Fold each tab in half lengthwise so that the right sides (the good sides of the fabric) face each other. Pin the sides in place, and use the sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the lengthwise edges of the fabric. Use a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and don’t forget to backstitch at the beginning and end of every new seam.[11]\n\nPress the seam open with a hot iron, then turn the tab right-side out. Position the seam in the center and press the whole tab flat.",
                "Hem the side seams. On each side of the curtain, fold the edge over (wrong sides together) one inch (2.5 cm) and press it in place. Fold this over another inch and press it again. Sew the hem at a three-quarter-inch (1.9 cm) seam allowance, and press it when you're finished.[12]",
                "Attach the tabs to the curtain. Measure out the desired spacing for your tabs, marking where the center of each tab will go with a fabric marker or chalk. Fold the tabs in half (with the seam on the inside) and place them upside down on the curtain, lining up the raw edges of each tab with the raw edge of the top of the curtain. Pin the tabs in place.\n\nSew each tab to the top of the curtain using a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance.",
                "Prepare the facing. Fold the side (widthwise) edges of the facing over one inch (2.5 cm) and press them in place. Then fold up the bottom (lengthwise) edge one-half inch (1.27 cm) and press them.",
                "Attach the facing to the top of the curtain. Lay the facing right-side down over the curtain top and the tabs, lining up the raw edges. Pin the facing in place and sew along the top at a half-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance.\n\nOpen up the fabric at the seam and press the tabs and the facing upward. Then fold the facing piece down behind the curtain and press it again. Pin it in place, and top stitch around all the edges.[13]",
                "Hang the curtains to check the hem. At this point, it’s a good idea to hang the curtains in case you need to adjust the length of the hem at all. Take the curtains down when you have finished checking.[14]",
                "Sew the hem. Fold the hem up four inches and press it in place. Fold that up another four inches and press that too. Position the edge of the presser foot along the top edge of the fold and top stitch the hem.",
                "Hang the curtains. Once you're happy with the finished product, you can get your curtains up and decorating your window!"

        "wikiHow to Protect Laminate Flooring": {
            "intro": "Laminate flooring can be susceptible to scratches, dents, scuff marks, and other types of damage. Flooring is especially susceptible in areas with heavy foot traffic, or when you move furniture, such as chairs, across the flooring on a regular basis. In some cases, humid weather or the toenails of your pets can also damage laminate flooring. You can protect your laminate flooring with items like rugs and pads, with proper cleaning, and with other modifications.",
            "steps": [
                "Attach protector pads to the bottom of furniture. Furniture tends to move slightly across flooring with daily use. Pads will help prevent the bottom of your furniture or other sharp parts from scraping or scratching against your laminate flooring. You can purchase pads made out of several different types of materials, like felt, plastic, carpet, and cane. You can purchase protector pads from most home improvement and flooring stores.[1]\n\nPurchase protector pads, or discs, with adhesive on one side that you can stick to the bottom of your furniture.\nPeriodically examine the felt protector pads you attached. The pads may need to be replaced when the felt becomes compressed due to regular wear of the furniture.",
                "Put carpets or rugs on your laminate flooring. “Lanes” can often form in areas of laminate flooring that are often used. Rugs or carpets can be placed in areas with heavy foot traffic to avoid this problem. You can place rugs under furniture to prevent scratches and scrapes from marring the laminate flooring, too. Rugs can also be placed in areas that are likely to come into contact with water, like under the kitchen sink.[2]\n\nPlace rubber or non-slip pads beneath your rugs in heavy foot traffic areas to prevent them from sliding around.",
                "Place entry welcome mats at doorways. Dirt, pebbles, and sand from shoes can easily scratch laminate flooring. Putting mats at your doorways can prevent this from happening. This will allow you, your family, or other visitors to wipe their feet before entering your home. You can also place mat at other areas in the home that are at risk of being scratched by debris .[3]\n\nYou can enforce a rule that bans people from wearing shoes inside your home, which may help eliminate any debris that is tracked onto the laminate flooring from shoes.",
                "Replace plastic casters with rubber wheels. Chairs are probably the most often moved pieces of furniture in the home, especially those at kitchen tables and desks. Take the plastic casters off of the chairs and replace them with rubber wheels. This will prevent scratching and damage to the floor.[4]\n\nMake sure to buy soft rubber wheels. You can buy this online from websites like castercity.com, and from many home improvement and office stores.[5]",
                "Lift furniture instead of dragging it. Do not drag or push furniture across the floor when you move it around. Instead, lift the furniture if possible. Lifting your furniture will prevent the scratches and scuff-marks that can be caused by dragging your furniture. If the furniture can’t be lifted, it is also an option to place slide it across the floor with something underneath it.[6]\n\nDo not do any lifting on your own if you feel that the furniture is too heavy. Ask a friend or family member for help.",
                "Slide heavy furniture across the floor. If you have difficulty moving large or heavy pieces of furniture, place plastic discs with padding on one side (also known as furniture sliders or moving discs) underneath your furniture. These discs will allow large and heavy furniture to glide across the laminate flooring without causing damage. Soft, thick towels or heavy blankets can also be placed underneath heavy or large furniture as an alternative to plastic discs.[7]\n\nAsk friends or family to help you with lifting furniture that is too large or heavy for you to move by yourself.",
                "Keep the humidity levels in your home between 35 and 65 percent. This will prevent your laminate flooring from warping due to the expansion or contraction of the laminate flooring materials. Use a humidistat to measure the humidity levels in your home. You may already have a humidistat built into your thermostat or humidifier, or you can purchase one from a retail store that specializes in home repair.[8]\n\nUse a humidifier during dry conditions to prevent your laminate flooring from shrinking, and use an air conditioner or dehumidifier in wet conditions to prevent your flooring from expanding.",
                "Keep the nails of your pets trimmed. Long nails on your pet can cause extra damage to the floor. Make sure to keep your pet’s nails trimmed, but do not cut them so low that it injures the animal. Take your pet to a groomer, or trim your pet's nails using nail clippers designed for use on pets.[9]\n\n\nYou should also check the pet’s paws when they come from outside to inside and remove any dirt and/or gravel.",
                "Avoid wet mopping. Wet mopping will cause extra water to seep into the floor, which will damage it over time. Mopping with water should also be avoided because soap and detergent based cleaners used with wet mopping damages laminate. Instead, purchase a spray on cleaner specially made for laminate floors and wipe the floors with a cloth, or use a dry mop.[10]\n\nManufacturers of laminate flooring will often put out their own brands of cleaning products. It is best to use what is specifically made for your type of flooring.\nGeneric brands are sold at supermarkets and flooring stores. Generic brands are typically okay to use, though you should test it on a small spot of your floor first.",
                "Clean spills from the laminate flooring as soon as they occur. This will prevent liquids from entering any cracks or joints in your flooring, which can eventually weaken your laminate flooring or cause it to warp. Use a soft cloth or mop to clean up spills instead of an abrasive sponge or other material that can scratch your flooring. Clean it up with the cloth alone, or with a cleaning product recommended by the manufacturer of your flooring if possible.[11]\n\nIf you are required to use a cleaning product other than water to clean up spills and can’t find a product made by your manufacturer, use a commercial window cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia contains properties that may strip away the protective sealant from the laminate flooring.",
                "Don’t use a vacuum with rotary brush heads. Do not use a vacuum with a rotary brush or beater bar head on laminate floors. These types of heads can damage the flooring. Instead, use a felt or brush type vacuum. Before vacuuming, check to make sure the wheels are clean and haven’t collected any dirt or grit.[12]\n\nVacuum and sweep daily to minimize the amount of dirt and grit on the floors.",
                "Make repairs quickly. You can repair minor damage on your own by purchasing a repair kit made specifically for laminate floors. Kits will typically be made up of silicon filler and wax sticks. More extensive damage may require a replacement of tiles or planks. It is best to seek a professional for extensive damage that will require replacement.[13]\n\nCompanies like Precision, Liberon, and Picobello offer laminate repair kits.[14]\n\nYou can buy repair kits at home improvement stores and online from websites such as Amazon."

        "wikiHow to Grow Algae": {
            "intro": "Algae are aquatic plants that grow using the nutrients found in their water and energy from the sun. Many different species of algae are grown, and they have many uses in our lives. Different species of algae can be grown to be everything from a food source to a source of biodiesel for trucks. One of the benefits to growing algae is that the process is easy and straightforward.[1]",
            "steps": [
                "Select a container. You should choose a container that is clear and transparent. This will allow sunlight to reach the algae. Glass and clear plastic containers are good choices.\n\n\nIf you are growing algae for a science fair project, you could use something the size of a plastic water bottle, or something larger like a small aquarium.",
                "Fill the container with water. Your growth medium will be composed primarily of sterilized water. Put the water in your clear container.[2]\n\nIf you are growing microalgae, you should use sterilized saltwater.\nIf you want to grow spirulina, use clean freshwater. You can use water from any source, such as tap or spring water, as long as it has been filtered with activated carbon or a ceramic filter.[3]\n\nIf you are worried about bacteria, boiling the water before using it will reduce contaminants.[4]",
                "Add nutrients to the water. In nature, algae cohabitate with and other aquatic life. These creatures keep the underwater ecosystem balanced and provide plenty of nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and silicates to the algae. Your bottle of water will be lacking those nutrients, and micronutrients like trace metals and vitamins, unless you add them. You can buy a nutrient solution over the counter, or take some water from a fish tank or pond to supply nutrients.[5]\n\nUsing water from a pond or fish tank could introduce other contaminants into the growth medium.\nYou can also mix nutrient solutions. The Walne medium is a nutrient mixture that is suitable for most algae.\nMeasuring the effect of different nutrient solutions could be one way to study algae in a science fair project.",
                "Find a place with plenty of sunlight. Before you add the algae, you want to know that you have a proper environment picked out. Look for a windowsill or somewhere outside in the sun that you can safely place your algae container. This will allow the sun to provide the energy needed for the algae to reproduce and thrive in your growth medium. If you have difficulty finding such a location, you can use grow lamps instead.[6]\n\nResearch your algae to determine what type of grow light is best for growing. Normal grow lights designed for plants are not very effective for certain types of algae. You may need to find a light that gives off primarily red and orange light.[7]\n\nDifferent types of algae will require different amounts of light, and getting algae too hot (above 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit) can be lethal to your algae.[8]",
                "Select a type of algae. The most up to date estimate suggests that over 70,000 different species of algae exist, and potentially many more species yet to be classified.[9] We use these different types of algae for a host of reasons. Many species of algae are used to produce biofuels to power electrical components. Other types of algae, such as spirulina, are used as a food source. Sometimes, algae is grown in a classroom setting as a science experiment. Your intended use will decide what kind of algae you should grow.[10]\n\nFor example, spirulina would be a good choice if you want to grow algae to supplement your diet.\nSpirogyra plants are sometimes used in science fair projects.",
                "Collect an algae sample. For a basic experiment, you can just use any sample of algae, grow it, and observe it. If you are looking at algal behavior in general, you can just collect an algae sample from the any pond, lake, or other natural source. That said, many different types of algae are found in nature. If you are investigating a particular type, you might want to be more careful about where you get a sample. In this case, you should order your specific algae sample or algae starter from an algaculture supply company, or online.\n\n\nFor example, many people are interested in growing a type of algae called spirulina. Because spirulina is often eaten, you should get your sample from a reputable company.\nIf you are growing algae for a classroom experiment, collecting any sample from a local pond or lake is usually sufficient.",
                "Add the algae to your growth medium. Once you have selected an algae to grow, simply put the sample into your growth medium. Make sure that the appropriate amount of light is still available. Allow the algae time to grow.[11]\n\nOften, a few weeks may pass before you can see the algae in the container. This is because many species of algae (referred to as microalgae) cannot be seen by the naked eye individually. They must reproduce and generate a high algal population to be visible to the human eye.\nIf you are growing a macroalgae species, such as kelp, you will be able to see it.",
                "Observe any color changes in the growth medium. As your algae grows, it will become more and more compact inside the container. The denser your algae population gets, the more opaque the solution will become. Most algae cultures will be green, but you can get different types of algae that are different colors.[12]\n\nFor example, the strain of algae known as rhodophyta has a red color.\nKeep a log of all changes that your algae undergoes.",
                "Add nutrients when appropriate. For a short term experiment, you will likely only need to add nutrients at the beginning. If you are growing algae on a long term basis, you will need to add nutrients with each new batch of algae. You also might need to add nutrients as the algae population grows. If you are unsure of when to add nutrients or how much to add, consult an algaculture specialist.[13]\n\nIf your algae population becomes too dense, you may have to separate some of it into a new container. Otherwise, the container will be okay as long as you are growing the algae.",
                "Look closer with a microscope. If you wish to learn more about your algae culture, look at it under magnification. Putting a drop of your algae culture on a microscope will likely reveal much more than looking with the naked eye. In addition to your algae, you may even find protozoans or other life forms in your culture.[14]\n\nThis will likely be required if you are growing algae as part of a science experiment for class or work."

        "How to Motivate Yourself": {
            "intro": "Motivation is a combination of a whole bunch of things, usually including some type of fear or intense desire. After all, the motivation battle is nothing but your head telling you \"I think I can,\" \"I think I still can,\" and \"I'm doing it!\" Because of that, we're going to home on three things: developing confidence, staying focused, and maintaining direction. And we're off!",
            "steps": [
                "Stop thinking in terms of fear. We're all guilty of thinking in the negative instead of the affirmative. We're busy not wanting things. That's fine and normal, but there is no action associated with not wanting something. You can't decide to do something because you don't want another. That's not how it works. That'll just keep you on the couch, doing nothing.\n\n\nFear is harmful for two reasons: A) It keeps you unmotivated. A negative goal isn't something you can go to action on. But what's more, there's B) It's draining and exhausting. Living in fear sucks. It keeps you in a state of perpetual worry instead of action. When you're drained and exhausted and worried, you are not going to be motivated. There's no two ways around it.",
                "Define your goal and your plan to achieve it. Now that we have you thinking in the positive, you gotta know what you're getting positive about. Instead of, \"I don't want to be homeless, poor, and live my life in a state of abject poverty,\" you're thinking, \"I want to be financially secure.\" Awesome. Now -- what's your plan to achieve that?\n\n\nWell, for that specific example, you'd create some type of income plan. It would involve making a budget, possibly going back to school, or expanding your business. You have concrete steps toward your goal. But for whatever you're facing -- be it weight loss, doing well in school, or following through with a dream -- you need to figure out what it is you want and just how you plan on doing that. If you really want it, it won't be all that hard to figure out.",
                "Keep it to just one. If you have a ton of things on your to-do list, sometimes it becomes daunting and you end up putting the list away and \"tackling it later.\" But if you have one thing on that list of yours, that's it. That's doable. It's doable and you can focus on it -- spreading yourself thin over a dozen won't do you or your goals justice.\n\n\nYou can't focus yourself if you're not focused on a specific goal. Break it down into small pieces as much as possible. If your goal is to shave 5 years off your appearance, attack it bit by bit. Start off with a new workout routine and get that down. Then, move to a new makeup regimen. Then, tackle your wardrobe. If you don't parse it out, your brain will raise it's arms (if brains had arms) up in surrender and you'll be left with no idea where to go or what to do.",
                "Make it fun. Straight up, doing something you flat out despise won't be something you keep up with. The second you can drop it like a bad habit, you will. For that reason, whatever you're doing -- be it saving up money for that new car or losing 15 pounds -- you gotta make it enjoyable. The more enjoyable it is, the more you'll do it. The more you'll do it, the better you'll get at it. The better you get at it, the quicker the end result will come.\n\n\nWhere there's a will, there's a way. Do you hate running? No problem. Take a kickboxing class -- the weight will fall off that way, too. Horrible at writing papers? Change to a topic that drives you. Can't save money to save your life? Switch environments. Your world is malleable -- what you make of it can change your motivation entirely.",
                "Read about it. On the outside, this kind of sounds silly. How could reading about something that you think about all the time really get you motivated? But it does. Hearing other people's success stories (especially when they make it sound super simple), gets your brain thinking, \"Hey! There's no reason I can't do that, too!\" You all of a sudden become logical. So stop Facebook stalking your high school peers and get to doing something useful.\n\n\nYou may think reading stories of people who have succeeded in losing 100 pounds may make you feel overweight and unaccomplished (for example), but if anything, you should feel driven, empowered, and armed with resources. You can learn from these people! And if their success doesn't resonate with you, at least it can bring out your competitive edge.",
                "Set rewards. Let's be honest: results just don't come soon enough. It takes years to make money from a new business, it takes months to reach weight loss goals, and it takes a virtual lifetime to be happy with yourself. That's just about the opposite of instant gratification. To overcome this unfortunate fact of life, give yourself rewards. Life sure isn't going to do it for you, so you might as well will.\n\n\nDon't just use rewards for the big end goal (though by all means do that!). Set up checkpoints for yourself and give rewards at those smaller successes, too. Lost 5 pounds? Great! That warrants a massage. Aced your last three tests? Super! A night out it is! Finished the first half of your book? Wonderful -- now it's time to go shopping.",
                "Keep the glass half full, not half empty. When we think about something we want, a necessary part of that is realizing we don't have it. That can turn into a whirlwind of negativity, starting us down the path of self-pity, lethargy, and ending in a box of w(h)ine. Don't go there! Think about what you do have, what you're grateful for. Only then can you make what you have better. Kick out your negativity.\n\n\nMake of list of 10 things you have and are thankful for. Go through it every day (and then come up with another one when you think of more). Focusing on what you have done, made, and are will instill in you a sense of confidence. When your attitude is, \"Heck yeah, I can do this!\" (looking at your past accomplishments will prove to you you can!) it makes the goal a lot easier to reach.",
                "Find out just what you need to do. Let's say, for example, that you want to become an actor. That's great! ...But where do you get started? Not knowing the first thing about how to do something can be very intimidating and stop you dead in your tracks. Dream automatically crushed. But when you know the path you need to take, it's a lot easier to hop on.\n\n\nTap into your resources. With technology, you have the veritable world at your fingertips. That's code for \"you have no excuses.\" Ask friends, acquaintances, people that look like they've done it on the street -- doesn't matter. Do your research online and figure out the best, most efficient way to get done what you need done. You'll end up feeling like an expert and the knowledge will ease your mind. This will usher out the worry and negative self-talk and bring in the confidence and go-getting attitude.",

You could say, \"Tomorrow I'm going to breathe all day!\" and you'd be able to find someone who would bet you $10 you won't do it. It's best just to avoid these people. They're miserable and don't deserve your attention.\n\n\nOkay, these people can be helpful in very, very, very small amounts. If you do find yourself next to that negative Nancy and you can't escape her, let her fuel your fire. Let her burn you up inside until you have no choice but to do the exact thing she thinks you're not capable of. Her defiance of your ability can lead to just the right amount of adrenaline and determination you need to get the job done. Maybe one day you'll be able to thank her! Gosh, wouldn't you both just love that.",
                "Start small. There's no way having a goal of \"becoming world famous\" or \"losing 75 pounds by winter\" or even \"mastering the clarinet\" are ever going to happen easily. Alright, so maybe those are a bit extreme, but you get the point. Having a goal that just isn't going to happen will turn you off and keep you from being successful.\n\n\nInstead of becoming world famous, losing a ton of weight, or mastering the clarinet, opt for having a successful YouTube channel, losing 10 pounds this month, or playing a classical piece on the clarinet. YouTube have at tonnes of beautiful motivational channels like Project Elon and Basquiat Picasso and many more. All these things are working toward these super-massive goals, but they're doable. Doable is something you can stick to.\nStart small in the mornings. If you have a list of tasks, you may find it beneficial to start with the smallest one. This gets the ball rolling and eases you in to the harder parts of the day. Getting going really is half the battle.",
                "Use visualization. For a few minutes each day, sit down and visualize obtaining your goal. Visualize having it. Being it, doing it, achieving it, whatever. What does it feel like? After the few minutes are up, how do you feel?\n\n\nMake sure to use all your senses. What do you taste, smell, see, feel, and hear? What is life truly like? What adjectives can you use to describe this new life of yours? Work in the details to make it as clear as possible. Where are you? What are you doing? What are you wearing? How do you look? Who is with you?",
                "Stay excited. Things always lose their novelty as soon as we get used to them. Walk by the Sistine Chapel enough times and you'll stop noticing it's there. If you've been working at this goal for a while, you risk just getting bored. NO! That mustn't be allowed. You gotta switch it up and keep stimulating your senses.\n\n\nExperiment with new means of reaching your goals. If it's weight loss, pick up a new healthy habit. If it's making money, try a new business strategy or budgeting system. Keep yourself on your toes.\nSurround yourself with images. Constantly reminding yourself what's out there can be a good way to stay in the game. Change your desktop to a series of motivational images. Write yourself little notes in unexpected places. Remind yourself, \"Oh yeah, I'm doing this -- and I'm getting there!\" That's surely something to be excited about.",
                "Refine your plan. You have your goal all set out and you have how you're going to achieve it...but as you go on this path to awesome stellar-ness, you've probably found that a few of the things you thought originally would get you there aren't working -- or at the very least, they're too time-consuming to warrant being worth it. It's time to analyze your results and do a little tweaking.\n\n\nMake a list of activities that you've been doing to reach your goal. Now, which ones are yielding the highest returns? Which ones have good intentions but don't really cut it? Once you've established what's best and what's not, focus the majority of your attention on these high-profit activities, tweaking them to make them even better. Instead of one daunting task, you now have several manageable ones.",
                "Put yourself in the public eye. It's Monday morning and you've decided to give up coffee (Ha! Good one.). You decided this at 7:30 and by 9:00 you're at the office chugging it like it's in your job description. No one knows about your failures but you and you'll forget about that with the caffeine high. What you should have done? Tell all your coworkers.\n\n\nAnnouncing to the world that, \"Hey! I'm doing this!\" gives you automatic pressure to stick with it. Hopefully, you won't be surrounded by a cluster of enablers and they'll make it harder for you to fail, too. If your coworkers would've known you were giving up coffee, they would've hidden your mug in the boss' bathroom.\nThere's always the Internet, too. You probably interact with more people more often on it than you do in real life, huh? Sad, but most of us nowadays do. So post it on your Facebook, get it in your blog, and tweet the bajeezus out of whatever it is you're trying to do. Maybe you'll inspire someone else while you're at it!",
                "Don't make mountains out of molehills. You'll find this exact step in about a gallon wikiHow articles (and from all your friends and family members, too): Don't let the setbacks set you down for good. They are inevitable and they will happen. Even the most successful people have them -- in fact, they probably have more of them. Edison didn't fail, he just found 10,000 ways that didn't work, remember?\n\n\nIt's all too easy to have a setback and launch yourself into a pity party for 1 that keeps you from getting back on your horse. Well, you can't do that. When you have a setback, acknowledge that it's a set back. Allow yourself to sulk for 15 minutes and stop. Tomorrow is a new day. Today's setback has nothing to do with the future of tomorrow.",
                "Get like-minded friends for support. There are very few things in this world that you truly do alone. And ten bucks says you know a couple of people that could join you on your journey -- or at least cheerlead from the sidelines. If you have people that understand your plight, you'll feel much less weight on your shoulders.\n\n\nIt's important to ask for help when you need it. It's not a sign of weakness or naivete, it's a sign of being human. Having a solid support group you can lean on is not only resourceful, but it's just good sense. They'll keep you up when you feel like falling and present you with resources, ideas, and motivation that you wouldn't otherwise have. So seek out friends, an online community, a local club or organization, and get to forming a motivational network.",
                "Chart your progress. Humans naturally need things to be in concrete terms. You know how many people hate abstract art? It's just hard to understand. So when you're on this path to greatness, get things as tangible as possible. Keep track of your progress so you can sit down and see how great you're doing. Now that's motivating!\n\n\nKeep a journal dedicated to this task. Record your duties every day (and whether or not they get completed) and your check-ins to see if you've reached mini-goals. Bring it along with you wherever you go!"

                "Don't waste time sleeping in. A few days here and there are a good way to relish the freedom of summer but don't let it become a habit that eats into your entire break. Map out a range of activities that motivate you to get up and make the most of each day, whether it's reading, painting, art and craft, catching up on missed TV shows, visiting friends or whatever.\n\n\nDo something intellectually challenging, like learning a new language or teaching yourself a field you know you're never going to study at school.\nLearn a new sport. Either learn it by reading about it and practicing or find a club, group of players or a coach to help you discover a new sporting talent.",
                "Spend time with your friends. Visit friends and do fun things together, like roaming, chatting, visiting places such as the beach, museum. etc.\n\n\nHave sleepovers and backyard camping together.\nWrite a book, blog or website together.\nPlan and even run a small business together, to earn some money. A lemonade stand, car boot sale or craft items online are all achievable and fun options for raising a bit of cash together.",
                "Take some afternoon sleep. A nap here and there will keep your mind fresh and keeps you out of the sun at the hottest time of day. You might even be able to find enough energy to party all night!",
                "Listen to upbeat music, play games and just relax around your home. Focus on chillaxing when you're not having fun doing things.",
                "Hang out with your friends at favorite locales. For example, a favorite coffee shop, the local public swimming pool, a mall or have a picnic in the park.",
                "Visit the local water park. Have fun while you're keeping your cool. Take your friends with you. Be really kind and take your younger siblings too.",
                "Meet new friends. Go to places where it's safe to meet people of your own age, such as during sports, at a coffee shop or at special activities, such as computer games conventions. Say hi to new people and see if you can make new friends. Take your existing friends with you and all of you can make new friends together!\n\n\nThere are many places where you can meet new people, such as book signings, concerts, or even public events (for example, funfairs, festivals, etc.).",
                "Travel with your your family. Travel is an ideal way to pass some of the summer holidays. You can travel locally, for just a day trip, or farther afield, perhaps for a few days, a week or even a few weeks. Depending on your family's budget, consider camping, staying in motels or visiting a resort.\n\n\nPack plenty of snacks and water for travel. You'll need to drink more during the hotter weather.",
                "Consider traveling somewhere with friends. If you're old enough to go away with friends and a responsible older sibling to take care of you all, this can be a fun way to enjoy time with your friends away from home. Have at least one responsible person 16 or up per every two to three of you going. It's recommended that you visit somewhere close so that you can come home quickly if needed. Or, go and visit a family farm, lakeside retreat or cottage somewhere; it can belong to any one of your friend's families.",
                "Wear appropriate clothes. Summer clothing should be loose, comfortable, cool and carefree. Don't constrict yourself with tight and uncomfortable gear; this is the time for being as comfortable as possible. Cotton and wick-away garments are good for keeping your cool.\n\n\nWear a hat and sunscreen when you're out in the searing sun.",

            "intro": "Chemistry, like other math-heavy fields in the sciences, is a subject which requires hard work and effort to master. Chemistry entails equations, formulas, and diagrams; some of these may have to be memorized, while others require a complex understanding of chemical structures and math equations. To excel in chemistry, you’ll need to practice good study habits and pay attention during the lecture, lab, and while doing homework. Chemistry demands a lot of patience, enthusiasm and most importantly, a good relationship with the subject.",
            "steps": [
                "Grasp the category of chemistry you’re studying. The study of chemistry is generally divided into five broad categories, each with its own sub-disciplines and unique methods of study.[1] If you understand what broad field of chemistry you’re studying and what that means, you’ll be grounded and ready to learn particularities within the field. The five categories are:\n\n\nInorganic chemistry: the study of structures and compounds of substances made from all elements, except carbon.\nOrganic chemistry: the study of the compound of carbon.\nPhysical (or theoretical) chemistry: the application of mathematical methods to chemical problems.\nAnalytical chemistry: quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes chemical compounds.\nBiochemistry (or physiological chemistry): the study of chemical reactions within living cells and the chemical structures of living material.",
                "Read the assigned chemistry material before going to class. This will increase your familiarity with the material, and class itself will clarify questions that came up when you read the material, rather than raising questions. Reading material—such as book chapters and reading that will be covered in class— will familiarize you with the topic ahead of time.[2]\n\nThis technique is known as a “Flipped” or “Reversed” classroom, and has proven useful in multiple fields.",
                "Listen to your chemistry teacher in class. This should help make learning easier, since the instructor is there to clarify and explain information. Don’t take this time for granted, but actively focus on apprehending every point your teacher makes.\n\n\nAttend class regularly. As mundane as this can feel, regular attendance will ensure that you don’t miss the explanation of new topics. It’s easier to keep up with the class lessons than to catch up.",
                "Ask questions. Don’t hesitate to bring up your concerns in class if you are confused about any points, equations, or topics. No question is too small to ask; if you’re confused about a point in the lecture, it’s likely that other students are too.[3]\n\nDiscuss with your teacher or with your classmates if you have any problems with the chemistry topic.\nIf you’re struggling to understand a concept, ask your instructor for study guides or worksheets.",
                "Take plenty of notes. You can think of this as writing a “summary” of class: what did the teacher lecture about; what new topics or equations were introduced; what relevant questions were asked and how where they answered?[4]\n\nThis is especially important in the chemistry classroom. New concepts and equations will be built on those that you’ve covered earlier in the semester (or quarter), so it’s important that you understand ideas of chemistry. Having these written in your notes will help you remember.\nPinning down the important points that your instructor has presented in a class period will help you to understand key topics and ideas.",
                "Review your notes from class. You can also review notes while working on your homework after a chemistry lecture. It’s best if you review your notes shortly after the class; if you wait until the weekend, you may have forgotten some of the material already.[5]\n\nTake advantage of your school’s study-hall period to review notes from chemistry. [6]\n\nYou may find it easier to retain concepts when reading them from your own notes rather than from a textbook, since you will have already written the concepts in terms you understand.",
                "Re-read the text. Before you jump into solving homework problems, re-read the textbook chapters that were covered in class. This will solidify your understanding of the material, and save you time when you go to solve problems.[7]\n\nWhen working problems, avoid referring to the answer key unless you’re utterly confused. Work problems on your own as much as possible.\nStudy chemistry every day so that you retain as much of the information as possible. You will learn more and be more productive if you study chemistry for two hours each day, rather than 10 hours on Saturday.[8]",
                "Work to comprehend the homework problems. Comprehension will take time, but it’s more important than taking shortcuts to get the right answer. Give special care to the math problems, chemical formulas, and chemical equations.[9]\n\nMany students consider the chemical formulas and math equations to be the most challenging aspects of a chemistry course, so these are where you should focus your time. If you need to, brush up on: logarithms and simple algebra, fractions, percentages, and exponential numbers.[10]",
                "Have the latest version of the modern periodic table. Usually teachers will provide a copy for you but if you don't ask for it or obtain it. It's crucial. It will help you a lot, as you will get many important resources in it. The periodic table is a complex way of presenting a great deal of helpful chemical information. Learn how to read it, and keep it with your chemistry text and notebook.[11]\n\nIf you don’t have a copy of the periodic table, it’s available for free at many online chemistry websites.",
                "Work through every problem step-by-step. Many students skip certain chemistry problems and math equations, as the equations can be time consuming. However, they are also one of the most important parts of succeeding at chemistry.[12] Learn from the mistakes you’ve made in previous problems, and don’t move on to the next until you can solve each problem correctly.\n\n\nPractice drawing any diagrams in your lectures, then label them. Although it may feel repetitive at first, this can help you understand the structure of chemicals. This may also help you memorize information that will come up on a test.",
                "Study the material that will be on the test. At the end of every month (or every section of your chemistry course) you should study the topics taught during that time. If it helps, you can study together with your friends, and together discuss how to answer the questions.\n\n\nBe attentive to your studying. Work in an environment with as few distractions as possible. Shut off the TV, put away food and snacks, and work in quiet, distraction-free space.",
                "Make sure you understand the basics. To do well on any test or exam, you’ll need to have mastered the basics of chemistry, so you can solve more complex problems when they’re presented.[13] Before a test, make sure you have a solid understanding of significant numbers, the periodic table of elements, and chemical names and symbols.\n\n\nSolve sample tests or chemistry questions. This will make you more comfortable with tackling genuine test questions, and will also increase your chemistry confidence. Ask your instructor for sample tests, or search online for “sample chemistry test questions,” and specify your grade level.",
                "Write and memorize chemistry symbols and terminology. Like many of the sciences, certain aspects of academic chemistry must be memorized, especially before taking an exam. Write down terminology definitions, chemical symbols, and the names and properties of the 30 or 40 most common elements.[14]\n\nFlashcards are a helpful way to commit these symbols and terms to memory. Review these flashcards multiple times throughout a week, and a few times a day when a test is upcoming.[15]"

        "How to Make a Lotus Pond": {
            "intro": "Lotus makes a striking pond plant that will do well in US zones 5 to 9 without needing too much attention from the gardener. Keep in mind that lotus will need a fairly big pond, as the plants tend to grow quite large. You can either plant the lotus directly into the bottom of the pond, or into a container which you then place into the pond.",
            "steps": [
                "Plan to dig a large pond in a sunny part of your garden. Lotus do best in a large bog-type pond in a sunny area of the garden.\n\n\nExpect the lotus plants to grow pretty big and wide: leaves are up to 2 feet (0.6 m) across unless you try growing a dwarf lotus. They’ll also grow fairly tall.\nIf you are growing a regular variety, your pond will need to be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) across and at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep to provide the lotus plant with enough space\nIt’s best to wait until the winter is over before digging your pond so the ground is easier to work.",
                "Choose a material to line your pond with. Decide whether you are using a rigid plastic pond liner or a flexible material liner that you can cut to fit. Dig out the space for your pond and line with whatever you are using.\n\n\nIf using pond lining fabric, make sure there’s 12 inches (30.5 cm) of material running over the edges of your pond hole.\nYou then need to bury the excess liner at the margins of your pond under some dirt, stones, gravel or flagstones. This both hides the material and weighs it down.",
                "Add a mix of compost and manure to the bottom of the pond. You now want to add a mix of compost/topsoil and well-rotted manure to a depth of 9 inches (22.9 cm). Cover this with one or two inches of sand and/or gravel or lava rock.\n\n\nLining the edges of the pond with large river rocks will also look nice – just be careful not to stretch or tear the pond liner.",
                "Fill the pond with rainwater. If you only have tap water, leave it to stand for a few days to reduce the chemical level (especially important if you plan to add fish).\n\n\nAvoid gushing water into the pond as this will unsettle the layers of sand, gravel and dirt and make the water muddy.\nYou’ll need to wait until the temperature of the water is above 70 °F (21 °C) before you can think about planting your lotus into the bottom.",
                "Plant the lotus rhizomes once the water is at the correct temperature. When you are ready to plant, place a lotus rhizome onto the layer of sand at the bottom of the pond and weigh it down with a handful of gravel.\n\n\nAlternatively, in a larger-sized pond you can plant the rhizome into a big planter to keep the lotus contained in that area.",
                "Care for the lotus plant as it grows. Lotus are hungry plants that need fertilizing during the summer months. You can get special water fertilizing tablets online or in some garden stores.\n\n\nStart fertilizing at half strength in June then through the rest of the summer apply full strength fertilizer. In the fall, around October, the plant will go dormant. Once the leaves brown and wither away or fall off, you can clean the pond.\nLotus are frost-hardy, but in cooler areas consider moving container-planted lotus to deeper water. This is because the deeper water is less likely to freeze.",
                "Prevent the pond water from becoming stagnant. Mosquitoes may use stagnant water to breed in. You might like to use chemical controls (available on Amazon) or consider installing a fountain to keep the water moving, thus making it less attractive for breeding insects.",
                "Plant the lotus in a container to prevent it from spreading. You don’t need to plant the lotus rhizomes directly into the bottom of the pond, you can also plant them in a container, which you can then put in the pond.\n\n\nPlanting lotus in a container is a good idea in a fish pond, as it helps the contain the lotus' spread.\nA half barrel or big planter will also do fine for this.",
                "Choose an appropriate container. It’s important to use a round container so the corners don’t choke up as the lotus spreads into them. Don’t choose containers that have drainage holes: the water will come from the top not the bottom.\n\n\nAlso avoid using regular basket-type mesh planters that are commonly used to contain aquatic plants. The fragile lotus growing points will get snared up in any gap or corner and will be damaged.\nBlack absorbs heat well and A black plastic, round planter at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep (without drainage holes) is best.for lotus. The color is important, as black helps to absorb heat.",
                "Ensure that there are at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water above the surface of the container. Plant the lotus rhizomes into your container and place the container into the pond so the top of the soil in the container is 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) below the surface of the water.",
                "Ensure that the water is shallow enough for the lotus. Lotus need fairly shallow water so if you have a deeper fish pond you will either need to have a shallow end for lotus or plant them in a container that is raised on blocks under the water.",
                "Protect the lotus rhizomes from being eaten by the fish. Larger fish will eat lotus – Koi carp in particular. Therefore, you need to make sure that the planting bed is weighed down with sand and lava rocks or gravel to prevent them accessing the lotus tubers.",
                "Prevent the lotus from choking up your fish pond. Fish need clean, fresh, oxygenated water, food (usually on the surface), hiding places and enough space to move and grow.\n\n\nUnfortunately, lotus will easily choke a pond, therefore the pond will probably require a filter or fountain to keep the water fresh if you have fish – ask for advice at your local aquatics supplies store.\nLotus will prefer to be away from any fast moving water caused by a fountain or filter, so keep them in a separate part of the pond.",
                "Make sure the fish have enough space. Fish need enough space for their size – don’t believe the old wives’ tale that fish only grow to fit the available space. It isn’t true!\n\n\nThe fish won’t appreciate living in a small space with a fountain pounding overhead and lotus choking up all the space.\nYou’ll need to confine your lotus to one area of the pond and let the fish have the rest of the space."

        "wikiHow to Greet in Islam": {
            "intro": "In our era of globalization, we often come into contact with people different from us. This is particularly true in international business settings. Want to greet a Muslim respectfully? A few simple rules will help you do that.",
            "steps": [
                "Use the Salam greeting when meeting a Muslim. Greet a Muslim as they would greet one another.\n\n\nUse the phrase \"As-Salam-u-Alaikum\" (\"Peace be unto you\").[1]\n\nThis is pronounced “as-saa-laam-muu-ah-lay-kum.”\nYou might also choose to use the longer greeting of \"As-Salam-u-Alaikum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh\" (\"Peace be unto you and so may the mercy of Allah and his blessings”).\nThe pronunciation is “us-saa-laam-muu-alie-kum waa-rah-ma-tull-laa-hee wa-bara-kaa-tu-hu.”",
                "Do not expect the Salam greeting from a Muslim. Traditionally, the Salam greeting is reserved for those of the Muslim faith, so if you are not Muslim, you might not receive this greeting.[2]\n\nSome current Islamic scholars believe that, in the interest of global peace and understanding, it is permitted to initiate the Salam greeting with non-Muslims.[3]\n\nIf you do receive the Salam greeting, respond with \"wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah.\"\nThe pronunciation is \"waa-alie-kum-us-salam waa-rah-ma-tull-la\"\nThe meaning is \"May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.\"[4]\n\nThe longer response is \"waa-alai-kum-us-salam-wa-rahma-tall-ahi-wa-ba-ra-ka-tu\".",
                "Expect a Muslim to return the Salam greeting. If greeted with the Salam greeting, a Muslim will respond to a non-Muslim with the return greeting (\"wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah\").\n\n\nIt is obligatory for a Muslim to return the Salam greeting, regardless of the religion of the other person. To refuse this is against their religion.[5]\n\nAccording to the Qu'ran (Muslim holy text), the Salam greeting has been mandatory since the creation of Adam and is commanded by Allah.[6]",
                "Shake hands with male Muslims if you are male. It is common for Muslim men to shake hands.\n\n\nThere is generally no prohibition against men shaking hands with other men.\nThe exception is some Shia Muslims prohibit shaking hands with any non-Muslims.[7]\n\nDo not be offended if a Muslim declines to shake your hand. It isn’t a personal affront but a reflection of their religious beliefs.",
                "Do not shake hands with female Muslims if you are male. While there is debate on the appropriateness of female Muslims shaking hands with men, you should not do so unless she initiates the contact.\n\n\nMany Muslim women do not shake hands with men due to religious prohibitions against a woman being touched by a man outside of her family.[8]\n\nSome Muslim women, especially those working in corporate environments, might shake hands with men.[9]\n\nSome Muslim women wear gloves in order to get around the prohibition against touching a male who is not a relative.[10]",
                "Do not shake hands with male Muslims if you are female. Regardless of your religious beliefs, you should not reach for a male Muslim’s hand unless he initiates the contact.\n\n\nPious Muslim men do not touch women outside of their family (wives, daughters, mothers, etc.)[11]\n\nRefraining from touching a woman she is not related to is considered a gesture of respect and modesty.[12]",
                "Greet your fellow Muslim by wishing them peace. One should always greet a fellow Muslim.\n\n\n\"As-Salam-u-Alaikum\" is the most common greeting among Muslims.[13]\n\nThis is the minimum required when greeting a Muslim.\nIt is permissible to use the minimum greeting when time is short, such as when passing each other on the street.\nAdd “wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh” to complete the greeting.",
                "Remember that Allah commands that Muslims greet one another. Be mindful of the rules governing who initiates the greeting.[14]\n\nThe one who comes greets the Muslims that are present.\nThe one who is riding greets the one who is walking.\nThe one who is walking greets the one who is sitting.\nThe smaller group greets the bigger group.\nThe young greet the elders.\nSay the Salam greeting when arriving and leaving a gathering.[15]",
                "Return the greeting. Always acknowledge the greeting by giving a response.\n\n\nRespond with \"wa Alaikum Assalam wa Rahmatullah.\"[16]\n\nIt is permissible to respond only with the first part (\"wa Alaikum Assalam\")."

            "intro": "Porcelain dolls can last a lifetime if you take proper care of them. It is possible to restore your porcelain doll or maintain its good quality by giving it a little attention and care. By handling your doll carefully, cleaning it well, and fixing it when it breaks, you can keep your doll in good condition.",
            "steps": [
                "Always use gloves. Porcelain dolls are extremely fragile and should be handled with great care. A porcelain doll that is a child’s toy does not need to be handled with gloves. However, when a doll is a collectible or a decoration you should always wear white cotton gloves when you handle it. The oils on your skin can stain the doll’s porcelain and clothing, as well as attract dust. [1]",
                "Lay your doll out on a towel to protect it. When cleaning or dressing your doll lay it out on a towel, not directly on a table. This will protect your doll from getting any dirt or smudges on it. The towel also helps prevent breakage by adding another layer of protection for your fragile doll. [2]",
                "Store the doll safely. If your doll is a collectible or you want it be extra safe, store it in its original box or a ventilated container. You can purchase doll display cases online that work well for this. However, if you smoke, store your doll in an airtight container to prevent stains. The doll should always be out of direct sunlight and be in room temperature, not extreme temperatures.[3]\n\nKeep your doll somewhere not too close to a window to avoid high temperatures and harsh light from outside from damaging your doll.",
                "Detangle your doll’s hair. Carefully detangle your doll’s hair with a hair detangling pick. Keep your doll’s hairline dry, otherwise the glue might come loose and the wig might fall off. Synthetic and straight hair can be carefully brushed with a wire brush. Curly hair should not be brushed because the curls could get ruined. [4]",
                "Dust your doll. Regularly dust your porcelain dolls with a feather duster or a large, soft paint brush. This will help keep your doll clean and might mean you never have to give it a deep cleaning. [5] If there is stubborn dust you can put your doll in a nylon sock and carefully vacuum the doll over the stocking or use an air compressor on the lowest setting. If you don’t use the stocking your doll’s hair can get frizzy, tangled, and ruined. If you don’t have a stocking you can cover your doll’s hair with your hands. [6]",
                "Clean the porcelain. You can carefully clean your porcelain doll with a dry cloth or chemical sponge. You can use a very tiny amount of water if needed, but don’t use too much. Rub the cloth or sponge on the doll. Make sure to wipe, not to scrub, otherwise the paint (especially the makeup on the face), might come off. [7]\n\nYou can clean crevices and hard to reach places (such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) with a Q-tip or toothbrush. Make sure to be very gentle, especially around the eyelashes. [8]",
                "Remove any stains on the porcelain. If your doll has stains on it, you can try to carefully remove them. Start with a little bit of gentle detergent diluted in water and wipe the stain. If that does not get the stain off, you can try a little bit of baking soda and water. Always test on a hidden part of the doll first because using soap or baking soda can cause the paint to possibly come off. [9]",
                "Wash your doll’s hair. If your doll’s hair is really dirty you can carefully remove the glue on the wig with your fingers and water. Use water and glass cleaner to clean synthetic hair and gentle detergent to clean human hair. Once the wig is completely dry you can reattach it with white glue. [10]",
                "Fix cloudy eyes. You can fix your dolls eyes if they are foggy and crystalized. Put a very small drop of sewing machine oil on your dolls eyes. Rub the oil in then lay your doll down on its stomach. You should leave it there for about an hour. Make sure to check on it once or twice to make sure the oil has not spread onto the porcelain. It is very important to only use a small amount and that it does not touch other parts of the doll besides the eye. The sewing machine oil might cause cracking if you are not careful. [11]",
                "Repair the doll’s clothes. Fix any holes in the clothes by hand sewing them. If you notice dirt or stains on your doll’s clothes you can take them off and wash them. Try to remove any accessories off of the clothes that you can before washing them. Hand wash the clothes in cold water and let hair dry. [12]",
                "Take your doll to a repair shop. If your doll has any cracks or does not look like you can repair it yourself, take your doll to a doll repair store. There are many doll repair stores that will fix your dolls. You can search for “doll hospitals” or “doll repair shops” in your area to find one that can repair your doll."

Still, it is a good idea to think about your reasons for wanting a small dog before you make your decision. Are you looking for a dog that will sit on your lap and keep you company at night? Or are you looking for a guard dog that will bark to alert you if there are potential intruders nearby? Take some time to identify the reasons why you think a small dog is the best choice for you and your lifestyle.[1]",
                "Think about what you want in a canine companion. In addition to considering your reasons for wanting a small dog, you should also think about the type of personality you want your small dog to have. Small dog personalities vary greatly by breed, so it is important to identify the traits that you want your dog to have before you start considering breeds.[2]\n\nConsider your activity level. Some small dogs are very energetic and require a lots of exercise and attention, while other dogs are quite lazy and will be happy to lounge around with you most of the time. Be realistic about how often you will be able to walk your dog and play with your dog.\nConsider the other members of your household. Do you have children? Other pets? Frequent guests? Some breeds of small dogs are better with children, other animals, and new people than other small dogs. Think about who shares you home with you and what they need in a small dog.\nConsider your ability to groom your dog. Some small dogs will require very little grooming, while others will require regular grooming in the form of baths, brushing, and haircuts. Think about whether you are willing and able to groom your dog yourself or if you have the money to pay a professional groomer to do it.",
                "Research small dog breeds. Once you have considered the personality that you want your small dog to have, start researching small dog breeds to find one that is compatible with what you want. There are many small dog breeds and they all have different personalities, temperaments, and traits because of their breeding history.\n\n\nAny small dog breed with “terrier” attached to the name has been breed to hunt or work, so they can be feisty and do best as an only pet. This is why your research is so valuable, because certain types of terrier are not so good with small children. Terriers as a whole have a strong instinct to chase cats and may not be the best choice if you have other pets.[3]\n\nTalk to a veterinarian about to get a recommendation on a small dog breed that would be compatible with your lifestyle.",
                "Be aware of potential health issues. Some small breed dogs are more prone to health problems than others. For example, dachshunds are more prone to intervertebral disc disease, pugs are more prone to respiratory issues, and miniature poodles are more prone to pancreatitis.[4] Keep common health problems in mind as you consider breeds. Since owning a pet is a lifelong commitment, you should be sure that you are willing and able to deal with any health problems that your pet may encounter over the course of its life.\n\n\nConsider whether you will be able to handle the veterinary bills if your pet is afflicted by a disease or other condition that is common to its breed. If not, you should consider a breed or a mix that is less likely to encounter major health problems.",
                "Consider adoption before looking into breeders. Many people surrender their dogs to local animal shelters simply because they cannot afford to keep them, not because they are bad dogs. Before you look into purchasing a dog from a breeder, check your local animal shelter to see what types of small dogs they have available. If you choose to adopt, you can take pride in the fact that you are providing a loving home to a deserving little dog and helping your local animal shelter in the process.\n\n\nAdoption is cheaper than buying from a breeder, since some breeders may charge upwards of a $1000 for one of their dogs. Adoption costs are kept low to encourage people to adopt. The cost of adopting a dog is usually between $50-$200.[5]\n\nAnother advantage of adopting from a shelter is that the dog will already be up to date on his or her shots, spayed or neutered, and possibly even house trained.[6]\n\nYou can even learn about the dog’s personality from the shelter employees or the people who are currently fostering the dog.[7]\n\nAdopting a dog from your local shelter may even save its life, since shelters are so overcrowded and many shelter have to euthanize perfectly good animals to conserve space.[8]",
                "Visit your local shelter. If you have decided to look at small dogs at your local shelter, find out when their visiting hours are and then go for a visit. When you go, ask to walk through the shelter and meet some of the available dogs. Some dog shelters have pictures of dogs available for adoption on their websites, which may help you to identify the dogs that appeal to you before you go for a visit.[9]",
                "Pay attention to body language. As you walk through the shelter, pay attention to how the dogs that you are interested in react to you. Do they seem playful, shy, aggressive, or fearful? Watch for positive body language such as wagging tails, pressing against the cage to sniff you, and relaxed open mouths. If a dog seems aggressive (barking, growling, etc.), you should probably steer clear of that dog.[10]",
                "Spend some quiet time with your top choice. Once you have identified a dog that seems like it will make a good companion, ask to spend some time with the dog. You should allow the dog to come and investigate you. Allow him to sniff you and approach you in his own time. Pet the dog and see how he responds to your attention.[11]",
                "Ask shelter employees and volunteers about the dog’s demeanor and behavior. Once you have had a chance to spend time with a dog, you should ask some questions about the dog to decide if he is right for you. The shelter employees and volunteers have spent lots of time with the dogs in the shelter, so they should be able to answer any questions that you have about the dog’s energy level, personality, and so on. Make sure to tell them what you are looking for in a canine companion as well.[12]",
                "Visit again before making your final decision. If possible, it is a good idea to pay another visit before you take your dog home with you. If you have a partner, children, or another dog who could not come with you on this first visit, make sure that you bring them along for the second visit. It is important to make sure that your new dog gets along well with everyone that is living in your home.[13]",
                "Research breeders. If you decide that you want to purchase a dog from a local breeder, do your homework before you select one. Ask around to find a reputable breeder in your area. Talk to friends, a local veterinarian, local pet shops, and doggy day care centers to find out who the most reputable breeders are in your area. You should also pay a visit to the breeder to see where the dogs are kept and how they are treated before you consider one of their dogs.[14] Reputable breeders will do certain things to make sure that their dogs are healthy and happy, which affects the health and temperament of the dog when you take it home.",
                "Schedule a visit to a breeder’s home. Reputable breeders will be happy to have you come to their home, meet their dogs, and show you around. If you contact a breeder and they seem unwilling to have you over to see their dogs and where they are kept, that is a red flag. You may want to avoid this breeder because he or she may not be taking good care of the dogs, which can mean that the dog will have health and/or behavioral problems.[15]",
                "Consider the living conditions of the breeder’s dogs. When you go to visit a breeder, he or she should show you where the dogs are kept. If not, make sure that you ask to see where they eat, sleep, play, etc. As a general rule, small dog breeders should keep their dogs in their home rather than in an outdoor run. Consider some of the following questions as well:[16]\n\nAre the dogs’ living spaces clean and well-maintained?\nDo the dogs have ample space to run and play or are they confined to small cages?\nDo the living conditions seem overcrowded? (too many dogs for the space they are provided)",
                "Observe the behavior of the dogs. The way that a breeder’s dogs react to you and to the breeder may also be a sign that this person is or is not a reputable breeder. Pay special attention to how the dogs react to you when you approach them or when the breeder approaches them. The dogs should not do things that indicate that they are fearful, such as cowering or hiding. The dogs should seem healthy, energetic, and playful.[17]",
                "Pay attention to the breeder’s behavior and knowledge. The breeder should seem like someone who loves dogs and also knows a lot about them. If the breeder seems to lack knowledge or seems uninterested in the well-being of dogs that she has now or has sold to other people, this may be a red flag that the breeder does not have her dogs’ best interests in mind. A reputable breeder should:[18]\n\nbe knowledgeable about the dogs he or she breeds. The breeder should also encourage multiple visits by you and your family members\nshow you documentation on the dogs used to breed her puppies\nprovide references from other families who have purchased dogs from her stock\nbe involved with local breeding clubs specific to the types of dogs she breeds\nprovide information on training and care\nnot always have puppies available, but be willing to put you on a waiting list for one of her puppies in the future",
                "Find out about the breeder’s requirements. Reputable breeders will not just sell their dogs to anyone with money. They will have certain requirements for the people that want to purchase one of their dogs. Consider the questions that the breeder asks you to determine if he or she is reputable. If the breeder is reputable, you should be able to answer yes to all of the following questions:[19]\n\nDoes the breeder require you to explain why you want a dog?\nDoes the breeder ask you to explain who will provide the dog’s needs such as walking, feeding, and training?\nDoes the breeder ask you to sign a contract saying you will spay or neuter the dog unless you plan to breed it?\nIf you rent, does the breeder ask you to provide proof that dogs are allowed in your apartment?\nDoes the breeder ask you to provide references?\nDoes the breeder provide you with a health contract and give you plenty of time to look it over before signing?\nDoes the breeder ask you to sign a contract saying that you will return the dog to him or her if you are no longer able to care for the dog?"

        "wikiHow to Collect Social Security": {
            "intro": "The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) allows eligible individuals to collect Social Security retirement benefits at any point between 62 and 70 years of age. There are pros and cons to early or late collection, but the process remains the same. Social Security retirement benefits are based on income earned throughout people's careers rather than financial need at the time of filing an application. Social Security disability benefits provide income for individuals no longer able to work because of a medical condition.",
            "steps": [
                "Determine the eligibility requirements. You need to understand the basic eligibility requirements before you begin the process of applying for Social Security retirement benefits. You must be at least 61 years and 9 months old to apply for retirement benefits, you must not be currently receiving benefits on your Social Security record, and you can't have already applied for Social Security retirement benefits.\n\n\nApply for retirement benefits approximately four months before you want to start receiving them. For instance, if you want to receive benefits starting in January then you should start the process at least by October.\nIf you want to apply for benefits that will start more than four months in the future, your claim will not be able to be processed.[1]",
                "Check your anticipated Social Security retirement benefits online. It is highly recommended that you evaluate the level of benefits that you are likely to receive when you apply for Social Security before you begin the process. You can check your anticipated Social Security retirement benefits online at any time by going to the SSA website at: http://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.html.\n\n\nThese online calculators can give you a clear picture of your financial future and help inform your decision about when to collect Social Security and how to secure your future.\nThe \"Retirement Estimator\" will provide you with a personal estimate of how much your benefits will be, depending on when you retire.[2]",
                "Consider at what age to apply. The main decision you need to make with regards to your retirement benefits is when to apply. As you are eligible to apply anytime between 62 and 70 years old, you need to weigh the pros and cons for your particular situation. Generally, whenever you choose to retire, the benefits you receive will be about the same over your lifetime.\n\n\nIf you retire earlier, the monthly amounts will necessarily be a little smaller in order to cover the longer period in which you are collecting them.\nAs such, if you collect later, the monthly amounts will be greater, but the duration of the payments will be shorter.[3]\n\nFor example, if your full retirement age is 66 and you were to receive $1000 a month at that age, this would change significantly if you were to retire earlier or later.\nIn this example, retiring at the age of 62 would reduce your monthly benefit to around $750. If you retired later, at 70 years of age, your monthly benefit would rise to $1320.[4]\n\nUse the calculator to help inform your choice and don't rush into a decision.\nContact the SSA before you decide to retire to talk through your options.[5]",
                "Apply for Medicare at 65. If you decide to delay collecting your Social Security because you are still working, don't forget to apply for Medicare. Regardless of when you decide to retire, you should make your Medicare application three months before you will turn 65. If you don't enroll when you're first eligible you may be required to make a late enrollment payment.[6]",
                "Apply online. There are a few different ways in which you can make your claim for Social Security retirement benefits. The most straightforward of these is to apply online through the SSA website: http://www.ssa.gov/retire/apply.html. Completing this application should take less than 15 minutes and will provide the basic information required in order to begin processing your claim. This includes questions about you, your family, and your work.[7]\n\nWith this option you can begin whenever you like, and you don't need to make an appointment or wait in a line.\nYou don't have to complete the entire form all in one go. You can save your progress part of the way through.[8]\n\nOnce you have submitted the application it will be reviewed by the SSA.\nAfter the review the SSA will contact you if they need any further information or documentation from you.\nOnce they have everything they need, your claim will be processed and you will receive a letter in the mail about the outcome.[9]",
                "Gather all the necessary paperwork. If you apply online, there will be a list of documents that are required on the bottom of the application form, together with information about where you need to send them. If you are applying in person, you will need to gather together the documentation which you will be required to submit with your claim. The key pieces of documentation you may be asked to provide are:\n\n\nYour birth certificate or another proof of birth.\nProof of US citizenship, or, if you were born outside of the US, proof of lawful alien status.\nIf you had military service before 1968, you may need a copy of your U.S. military service papers. Such as DD-214 - Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.\nA copy of your W-2 forms, and/or self-employment tax return for last year.[10]",
                "Apply in person or over the phone. If you prefer to talk to someone in person when you submit your claim, you can do this at your local SSA office. You will need to phone in advance to make an appointment in order to do this. To find your local office enter your zip code into the SSA online search tool at: https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp. Here you will also find the relevant telephone numbers and opening hours of your local office.\n\n\nYou can also apply over the phone by calling the central SSA office at 1-800-772-1213.\nThe hard of hearing should call 1-800-325-0778.\nThe opening hours for the phone lines are Monday-Friday, 7am-7pm.[11]",
                "Know where to go if you live abroad. If you do not live in the US, you can still make a claim for your Social Security benefits. To submit your claim, you should contact your nearest US Embassy, Consulate, or Social Security Office. The staff there will advise you on how to proceed with your claim.[12]\n\nYou can apply for Social Security retirements benefits online through the SSA's Office of International Operations.[13]",
                "Determine whether you can apply. To be eligible to apply to the SSA for disability benefits you need to meet certain criteria. You must be 18 years old, or older, as well as not currently receiving any benefits on your social security record. You have to be unable to work due to a medical condition that is expected to last at least a year, or to result in death.\n\n\nYou cannot apply again if you have been denied disability benefits within the past 60 days.\nIf this is the case, you can request a review of this decision and the medical determination through the Internet Appeal.[14]",
                "Collect the personal information you need to apply. The information you need to collect for the application process can be broken down into three main areas: information about you; information about your medical condition; information about your work. The information about yourself you will need includes your date and place of birth, and Social Security number.\n\n\nIf applicable, you will also need this information about your current and any former spouse.\nYou also need to know the dates and places of marriage, divorce, or death.\nYou will also need to submit your bank account information, including your bank's Routing Transit Number, so you can receive payments electronically.",
                "Compile information on your medical condition. The information you will need on your medical condition and history includes detailed information about your illnesses, injuries, or conditions. This will include names, addresses, phone numbers, patient ID numbers and complete dates of treatment for all the doctors, hospitals, and clinics you have been treated by.\n\n\nYou must disclose the names of any medicines you are taking and who prescribed them.\nYou must also submit the names and dates of relevant medical tests and who ordered them.\nYou will be asked to supply the name, address, and contact number of someone who knows about your condition and can assist with your application.[15]",
                "Collect information about your work. Finally you will be required to collect detailed information about your work which will be submitted with your claim. The information you need includes the amount of money you earned last year and this year, and the name and address of your employer(s) for the those years. You must also submit your Social Security Statement, as well as the start and end dates of any military service before 1968.\n\n\nYou must draw up a list of the jobs you worked in the 15 years before you became medically unable to work. The list should only go up to five jobs, and should include the dates of your employment.\nYou are required to submit full information on any workers' compensation or similar benefits you have received in the past or plan to apply for.[16]",
                "Compile the necessary documentation. There are certain documents that you may be required to provide when you apply for disability benefits, so it's a good idea to gather all of these together before you start the application. You may be asked to produce a birth certificate and proof of US citizenship, or lawful alien status. You might also be required to submit military discharge papers if you had military service before 1968. You will need W-2 forms and/or self-employment tax returns for the last year. Further documentation you might need includes:\n\n\nMedical evidence already in your possession, such as test results, medical records, and doctor's reports.\nAny proof of temporary or permanent workers' compensation benefits received, such as pay stubs, award letters, or settlement agreements.\nNote that photocopies of W-2 forms, self-assessment tax returns, and medical documents are generally accepted, but for everything else it is likely that you will need to provide the original document.[17]",
                "Apply for disability benefits online. Before you apply complete the Adult Disability Checklist you can download from here: https://www.socialsecurity.gov/hlp/radr/10/ovw001-checklist.pdf to ensure that you have all the necessary information and documentation. Once you are satisfied, you can apply online by visiting https://www.socialsecurity.gov/disabilityonline. Applying online enables you to complete the application when it is convenient for you.[18]\n\nIf you prefer to apply over the phone, call 1-800-772-1213 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m, Monday through Friday. The deaf or hard of hearing should call TTY 1-800-325-0778.\nYou can apply in person at your local office, but will need to call ahead and make an appointment first.\nIf you live abroad, contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate.[19]",
                "Get a monthly payment. With both retirement and disability benefits, you will be receive a monthly payment directly into your bank account. The benefits are paid in the month after they are due. For example, your August benefits will go into your bank account in September. For retirement benefits, the exact date you receive payment will depend on your date of birth. If you were born between the 1st and 10th of a month, you will get the benefit on the second Wednesday of the month.\n\n\nIf you were born between the 11th and 20th, you will receive the payment on the third Wednesday.\nIf you were born between the 21st and 31st, your payment will be processed on the fourth Wednesday of the month.\nIf you are receiving retirement benefits based on someone else's earning record, the payment date will be calculated according to this person's date of birth.\nFor example, if you are earning benefits based on your spouse's earnings record, the date will be determined from your spouse's date of birth.[20]",
                "Get paid by electronic transfer. During the application process, you will have provided the required bank details in order for you to receive electronic payments. This is an easy and efficient way to pay out benefits, and it means that the money goes directly into your account without you needing handle any checks or cash. Most commonly you will be paid through direct deposit.\n\n\nAn alternative electronic payment method is the Direct Express card program. With this method you sign up to receive a specific card, which your benefits payments will be paid directly onto.\nYou can sign up for this program by calling the toll-free Treasury Electronic Payment Solution Contact Center at 1-800-333-1795. You can also sign up online at http://www.GoDirect.org.\nYou can also get the benefit paid to an Electronic Transfer Account. This is a low-cost federally-insured account that you can use for electronic payments.\nBanks, savings and loans, and credit unions all offer this account. Find a local provider by visiting the website at http://www.eta-find.gov.[21]",
                "Be aware of taxes. It is possible that you will have to pay taxes on your social security retirement benefits. Around 40% of people currently receiving social security benefits pay tax on this income. If you file a federal tax return as an \"individual\", and your income is more than $25,000, you will have to pay tax on your benefits.\n\n\nIf you file a joint return, you will have to pay tax on your benefits if you and your spouse have a joint income of more than $32,000.\nIf you are married, but file separate returns, it is most likely that you will have to pay tax on your benefits.[22]."

        "How to Make Body Sugaring Paste": {
            "intro": "Even though it’s an ancient form of hair removal, body sugaring has only recently become popular in the modern hair removal world. It looks and works a bit like waxing, but is created from much more natural, household ingredients.[1] If you have a few simple ingredients and a stove, you can create and use body sugaring paste in the comfort of your own home.",
            "steps": [
                "Grab a saucepan. If this is your first time making a body sugaring paste, don’t use your nicest saucepan. This process can be a bit tricky, and it’s not uncommon to burn the paste, which is a nightmare to get off the pan.[2] For safe measure, use a pan that you could stand to lose.\n\n\nAs you heat your mixture it will boil and bubble up, so make sure your saucepan is big enough that it doesn’t overflow.",
                "Pour in two cups of white cane sugar. This is the simple white sugar that you probably have around the house, or can find at any grocery store. It’s important to use white sugar for this recipe. Color changes are the main indicator used to determine if your paste is finished, so white sugar should be the base of your paste.[3]\n\nIf you want to make a smaller recipe, simply halve all of the ingredients. However, body sugaring paste can easily be put into a container and saved, so don’t worry if you create way more than you need for one session.",
                "Add 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup water. You can squeeze the juice from fresh lemons or buy lemon juice from the store, as long as you get a full fourth of a cup. Pour it into the cane sugar, and then add a quarter cup of water. Using a spatula or large spoon, mix the three ingredients together until thoroughly blended.[4]",
                "Put your stovetop on low. It is important that your mixture gets to a boil, but try to raise the temperature slowly and carefully so that the paste doesn’t burn. Don’t step away from the stove, especially if this is your first time making body sugaring paste. It can be tricky to get it hot enough without it burning, so you need to be vigilant.[5] It will be obvious if it starts burning, because it will turn a very dark, almost black color.",
                "Stir the mixture continuously until it's boiling. Don’t turn the heat on and leave your pot unattended. Keep stirring it over and over again, making sure that it never sticks to the pot.[6] As your mixture reaches a boil, it will begin to thin out. When you see it start to bubble it’s almost there, but make sure you allow it to get to a full-fledged boil.[7]\n\nIf you own a candy thermometer, use it here. Your mixture should reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the \"hardball\" candy stage.[8]",
                "Put a few droplets of the mixture on something white. You can use a plate, a napkin, a piece of paper, or anything. This will allow you to examine the color. Your finished product should be a golden color. When your mixture has reached a boil and is that color, turn your heat off. Make sure you’re still stirring.",
                "Use a microwave if that's all you have. Instead of the ingredients outlined previously, you will be using one cup of sugar, 1/4 a cup of honey, and juice from half of a lemon (about two tablespoons). Combine these ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and stir until everything is blended. Then, heat your mixture in the microwave for two minutes.[9]\n\nDon't go anywhere as it heats. You need to stir your mixture every 20 to 30 seconds.\nAfter two minutes are up, let it cool off a bit to use or store.",
                "Allow the mixture to cool off. This is especially important if you are going to use some of it right now for hair removal. You want it to be warm, but not hot, or else you can seriously burn yourself.[10] You can learn how to use your finished body sugaring paste here. Even if you aren’t going to use it immediately, let it cool off before you transfer it into a container.",
                "Pour your paste into a microwaveable-safe container. It’s important that the container can be heated, because you will want to give your paste a quick reheat before using it in the future. Store your body sugaring paste at room temperature. This will keep it from thickening, and make reheating an easier process.[11]\n\nIf you don’t have a microwave to use, you can always run your container under hot water to heat the paste.",
                "Reheat your body paste before you use it. If it thickens up a bit, add a few drops of water before placing it in the microwave. Heat your paste so that it’s warm, not hot. Again, it is easy to burn yourself with this so take extra precautions. When you reheat the paste, it will thicken a bit.[12]"

        "How to Treat Hot Spots in Dogs": {
            "intro": "A hot spot, or what veterinarians term \"acute moist dermatitis,\" is a painful and inflamed area of the skin that is often accompanied by discharge and a bad odor. Hot spots occur via allergic reactions to bacterial skin infections often caused by a lesion or wound. Skin breaks, lesions, and wounds can have a variety of causes, including flea bites, scratches, scrapes or nicks, anal gland problems, and underlying allergies. Dogs often itch and scratch skin breaks and wounds to such an extent that wet scabs form on the fur.[1] Hot spots can be painful for dogs and can become very large quite quickly. It is important to seek prompt and adequate treatment if you notice a hot spot on your dog.[2]",
            "steps": [
                "Watch your dog. Notice if your dog scratches or licks a particular spot constantly. This is usually a sign that he is suffering from some sort of skin irritation.",
                "Part and inspect your dog's fur. Examine more closely the problem area you have identified. Hot spots can be difficult to see with the naked eye because they tend to spread under the cover of the dog's fur. Usually by the time you notice them, hot spots are well established and growing rapidly. [3]",
                "Identify that you are dealing with a hot spot. Hot spots are red, moist, hot and irritated rashes. Other identifiers of hot spots include discharge and an unpleasant odor.[4]\n\nHot spots are most commonly found on a dog's head, hip or chest area.\nDogs with long hair and thick coats are most commonly affected.\nDogs who are not groomed regularly and have matted coats are also prone to developing hot spots, as are dogs who swim or are frequently in the rain.[5]\n\nDogs with hip dysplasia or anal sac disease are also more likely to suffer from hot spots because they tend to lick the skin on their hind end.[6]",
                "Check areas surrounding the hot spot. If you do identify a hot spot, take some time to carefully check the rest of the dog’s skin. Part the fur in the area surrounding the hot spot and examine for any other moist or reddened areas. All spots need to be treated immediately and, if possible, you should try to ascertain the underlying cause of the hot spot (flea bite, scratch, allergy, etc.).[7]",
                "Contact your vet. If this is your dog's first hot spot, seeing a vet is crucial. Your vet can give you an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.[8]",
                "Trim or clip the hair from the surface of the hot spot. Exposing the hot spot to air will dry out the moisture and help speed up the healing process. Be careful not to pull the hair, irritate the skin or cut your dog's skin.[9]\n\nDisinfect your scissors or clippers before clipping. In cases where there is a lot of discharge emerging from the hot spot, you will need to clean your clippers frequently while removing hair. Otherwise, the clippers will become plugged with debris. Remember to clean and disinfect the instrument after use.[10]\n\nHave your dog sit or lie down for this process. Get a second person if you need help keeping the dog still.\nTo avoid accidentally cutting your dog's skin, don't cut too close to the skin itself and instead leave a quarter inch of stubble.[11]\n\nIf the affected area is too large, shave it.[12]",
                "Clean the wound. Use an antimicrobial shampoo that you can purchase at a vet's office or a pharmacy for humans.[13]\n\nA good product will contain chlorhexidine as an ingredient.[14]\n\nYou can also clean the area with a mild, water-based astringent or antiseptic spray.[15]\n\nConsult your veterinarian before use of any product on a hot spot.[16]",
                "Leave the antimicrobial shampoo on the dog for 10 minutes. This will allow the medication in the shampoo to settle into the affected area and begin working. Rinse thoroughly after 10 minutes and dry the affected area completely.[17]\n\nIf using an alternative solution, read and follow the accompanying instructions on how to apply.",
                "Apply an antibiotic ointment or spray. Your vet will usually prescribe a topical medication, such as a Gentamicin or Betamethasone spray. Your vet may also recommend oral antibiotics, depending on the situation.[18]\n\nYou can apply an antibiotic treatment on the wound up to three times per day.[19]",
                "Keep the area dry. The air will help the wound heal more effectively, whereas more moisture will facilitate the wound's growth.\n\n\nKeep in mind that hot spots can't be covered with a bandage because this traps moisture in and thereby worsens the wound.[20]",
                "Inspect the wound twice daily. If there is a buildup of discharge, repeat the shampoo process (shampoo, rinse, dry) to keep the wound clean.[21]",
                "Check the dog’s entire body for any new or developing hot spots. This check should be done daily, particularly if it is hot or humid out.",
                "Stop the itch with an antibiotic. The best way to relieve itching is with an antibiotic prescribed by your vet. Your vet may prescribe a cream antibiotic that is applied directly to the skin in order to quickly and directly relieve the itching.\n\n\nHydrocortisone spray can help reduce the irritation, but should not be used long term.\nAntihistamines such as Benadryl may also provide some relief. The appropriate dosage is 1 tablet per 50 pounds.\nAvoid putting creams intended for humans onto your dog's skin, as this can make matters worse. Creams keep moisture in the area, and the spot needs to dry completely before it can heal.",
                "Use an Elizabethan collar if your dog keeps licking or biting the lesions. The cone-shaped collar will restrain your dog's reach, making him unable to further irritate the wound.[22]\n\nAn Elizabethan collar should not be used as the sole means of treatment for hot spots. Collars don't treat the hot spots but prevent your dog from making the lesions more severe. Untreated lesions will only grow and become more serious, in addition to being painful for your dog.[23]\n\nYou can wrap a sock around one of the dog's rear feet and tape it into place if the hot spot can be scratched by a rear foot.",
                "Trim your dog's toe nails. This keeps your dog from having a ready way to scratch the area and spread the infected discharge.[24]"

        "How to Accrue Vacation Time": {
            "intro": "Time off from one's career is, ironically, something many people work very hard for. Today, vacation time is more valuable than ever — the U.S. is one of the only developed countries in the world that does not mandate for paid vacation time, and nearly a quarter of U.S. workers now go without any paid time off.[1] The one thing you can't get any more of in this life is your time on earth, so if you're unhappy with the amount of vacation time you're currently accruing, use aggressive strategies to get more.",
            "steps": [
                "Work more. For most jobs that offer paid vacation, simply showing up to work helps you accrue vacation days. Though the specific rules will vary from business to business, usually, every day, week, or pay period worked will add a specific number of hours or days toward your total vacation time. For instance, in the U.S., it's common for an entry-level full-time employee to earn about two weeks (10 work days) of paid vacation per year.[2]Assuming about 250 days of work per year (5 days per week × 52 weeks per year - 10 days for holidays), this means that each day worked earns about 1/25 (4%) of a paid vacation day.\n\n\nAs noted, however, vacation arrangements can vary greatly between jobs. For instance, some employers may grant all vacation days at the beginning of the year and allow the employee to use them as she pleases. Other jobs — especially part-time and \"temp\" jobs — may not allow for any paid vacation at all.\nNote also that many employers choose to grant their employees \"sick days\" and/or \"personal days\" in addition to normal paid vacation time. These usually accrue at different rates than ordinary vacation days and are intended to be used for illnesses, moving, and other situations when the obligations of the employee's personal life interfere with his work commitment. However, it's common practice for employees to sometimes use these days for vacation time.",
                "If you're a new hire, finish your probationary period. Sometimes, employers require that a new employee works a certain length of time before he becomes eligible for benefits, including vacation time and other paid time off. If this is the case for your job, you'll need to finish your probationary period before you begin to earn paid vacation time — there isn't really a way around this.\n\n\nLike an employee's benefits, the length of a new hire's probationary period can vary from company to company. For instance, some companies have probationary periods of three months, while others have probationary periods twice as long.[3]\n\nIt's also important to note that employers may place an employee on \"probationary\" status for disciplinary reasons. If this is the case for you, you'll need to work with your employer to fix the problems that caused your probation to start accruing vacation time once again.",
                "Stay with your company in the long haul. Usually, long-term employees are rewarded for their loyalty with additional vacation time. Working for the same company over many years can have other benefits, as well, including raises, recognition, and additional work flexibility. If you're a relatively new hire but you're happy with your current job, consider aiming for a few years of good work to start earning additional vacation time.\n\n\nWhile vacation policies differ greatly between employers, on average, new hires in the U.S. earn about 14 days of paid vacation per year, while employees who have been working for more than 15 years earn about twice as much at 27 days per year.[4]",
                "If you're allowed, buy more vacation time. Even with paid vacation time, it can be tricky to schedule a lengthy, refreshing break from work — sometimes, two weeks per year just doesn't cut it. For situations where employees need to take breaks longer than the amount of vacation time they have saved up, some employers allow their workers to buy additional time from other employees or the company itself. In these cases, the vacation time is almost always valued at the full value of the equivalent time worked — for instance, if you make $20 per hour, a full eight-hour day off of work would cost 8 × 20 = $160.\n\n\nNote that, in these situations, the cost of the time off isn't usually paid as a lump sum. Instead, the cost is deducted in small amounts over a long period of time from the employee's regular paychecks.[5]",
                "Switch to full-time work if you are a temporary or part-time hire. Independent contractors, seasonal workers, and most other part-time or temporary (\"temp\") employees do not usually accrue vacation time, no matter how much they work. The logic behind this is that part-time workers have much greater flexibility in their hours than full-time workers, so they don't \"need\" as much vacation time.[6] However, in reality, it's easy for a temp worker with one or more jobs to end up working long hours without accruing any sorts of benefits (including vacation time). If you're in this situation, try making the switch to full-time employment either by reworking your commitment at your current job or by finding new work.\n\n\nIf you're a temp worker and you're on good terms with your boss, you may want to cautiously try asking for enough work to qualify as full-time and start earning benefits. Note, however, that the prospects for temp workers can be slim in this regard — many temps have a difficult time making the transition to full-time work.[7]",
                "Make the most of other \"time off\" to save vacation time. As noted above, vacation days are often not the only type of paid leave offered by employers. Companies often offer a certain number of \"sick days\" and \"personal days\" per year for things like illnesses, moving days, and so on. While these often don't accumulate as rapidly as paid vacation days (for instance, some employers offer one sick day per month worked), you may want to use these to take breaks when possible to preserve your vacation time.[8]\n\nKeep in mind that employers are also legally obligated to give you time off for certain types of important duties that are beyond your control. For instance, if you get a jury duty summons, most states have laws in place that require your employer to give you time off without requiring you to use your vacation days.[9] Similar protections are in place for members of the armed forces or reserves who have periodic military duties. However, these laws do not always require your employer to pay you for the time off.\nIn addition, many employers offer several days of paid bereavement leave when a close family member dies. However, this is often not mandated by law.[10]",
                "Don't let your vacation time reach its \"cap\". Most workplaces have a \"cap\" on the amount of vacation time that can be accrued. This means that once you have a certain level of vacation time saved up (like, for instance, three weeks), you won't continue to earn more vacation time, no matter how much you work. You want every hour that you work to go towards more vacation time, so if you're about to \"cap out\" on vacation time, seriously consider taking time off.\n\n\nVacation caps vary between employers — in many states, the law is worded to allow employers to offer as high or as low of a cap as is \"reasonable.\"[11] However, many state and private agencies set minimum recommended amounts. For instance, in California, the CEA (California Employers Association) recommends a \"cap\" of at least 1.5 times the annual amount of vacation accrued per year.",
                "Be ready to negotiate. Like wages, health insurance, 401(k) accounts, and other benefits, an employee's vacation time is subject to negotiation — especially in the U.S., where there is no national mandate for paid vacation time. If you can't get the level of vacation time you want without specifically asking for it, ask for it. If your employer is willing to talk, you may be able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of you.\n\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the strength of your bargaining position can vary greatly depending on your standing with your boss, the quality of your work, your current hours, the desirability of your skills, and more. In general, employees who are on good terms with their boss, who have a record of good work, and who have high-demand skills are more likely to fare well in negotiations.\nIf you've decided to negotiate with your employer (or potential employer), see the section below for helpful advice on getting the level of vacation that you want.",
                "If all else fails, look for a different job. If you're unable to get the amount of vacation time you need at your current job by using any of the strategies above, you may want to consider looking for other work. If you have a proven record of good work, highly sought-after skills, or both, there's a chance you may be able to secure a greater amount of paid vacation at a new job than at a current one.\n\n\nKeep in mind, however, that when you leave a job you forfeit all of the paid vacation you've saved up for that job. About half of the fifty states have laws that require an employee to be paid for his unused time off when he quits or is fired.[12] If you don't live in one of these states, strongly consider taking your vacation before you quit.",
                "Know the norms for vacation time in your field of work. One of the most important things an employee can take to the negotiating table is thorough knowledge of her field of work. Employers have an interest in keeping their wages and benefits competitive with their competitors — if they don't, they'll lose skilled employees to companies that are more generous. Before asking for more vacation time, do some research to find out the average amount of paid vacation time awarded to employees with jobs similar to yours in other countries. If you can prove that you're receiving less vacation time than is normal in your field, it will strengthen your bargaining position.\n\n\nOne great source of this information is the U.S. Department of Labor (specifically, its Bureau of Labor Statistics), which, among many other things, regularly publishes data on the sorts of benefits offered to employees in a variety of fields.[13]",
                "Aim high. When asking for vacation, it's a smart idea to ask for a little more than you actually want. This gives you plenty of room to negotiate — you may get what you ask for, but if your employer \"pushes back\", you're more likely to get the amount of vacation you actually wanted than if you had started with your original number. As long as your request isn't completely outlandish, it's unlikely that you'll damage your relationship with your boss by simply asking for the extra time.",
                "Bring examples of positive work to the negotiating table. For any sort of workplace negotiation, it's usually in your best interest to frame yourself as someone with a steady, dependable record of good work. Before you negotiate, take some time to review the work you've done recently and find a few examples of times when you've gone beyond your normal duties and done especially good work. If your employer is reluctant to give you the vacation time you want, you can bring these up to demonstrate your hard work and loyalty and claim that a little extra vacation will help you keep up your high-quality output.\n\n\nStatistically, taking occasional vacation leave is good for most workers' productivity. Research has found that, if every worker in the U.S. were to take just one more day of vacation each year, the U.S. economy would create an estimated $73 billion in revenue from the additional productivity.[14]",
                "Mention the negative effects of not taking enough vacation time. Just as important as the work you've already done for you (if not more so) is the work you'll do in the future. Telling your employer that you need the time off to keep the quality of your work high (with the implication that not taking a vacation will leave you unable to do your job properly in the future) can help your boss understand the importance of giving you a break.\n\n\nAgain, science supports the idea that vacation time can help make you a better worker overall. Research has shown that vacation time is one of the most important ways to prevent \"burnout\" — a state of intense fatigue and dissatisfaction that leads to dramatically reduced productivity.",
                "Ask for big breaks far ahead of time. Would it be a good idea to tell your boss that you plan on taking a two-week vacation the day before you plan to leave? Unless you have an unusually generous manager, the odds are that it is not. For the same reason, you'll want to ask for major increases in your vacation benefits well in advance of when you'll actually need it. This gives you two benefits — not only does it make you appear more kind and thoughtful in the eyes of your employer, but also gives you a better bargaining position. Since you don't need the extra vacation time right away, it will be harder for your employer to force you to settle for the bare minimum.",
                "Be willing to give up a small amount of pay or other benefits. Every negotiation with your manager is a give-and-take. To get what you want, you may have to give something back to your employer. For instance, if you want the freedom to work from home on certain days as a sort of \"semi-vacation,\" you may be asked to take a minor cut in your salary. It's up to you to work out an arrangement that's satisfactory for you and your employer.\n\n\nAs a very general rule, you'll never want to take a reduction in pay in exchange for vacation time that's equal to or greater than the amount of money you could have made from working during your vacation. Agreeing to this is against your financial interests — in effect, it's reducing your wages for no net benefit to you.",
                "Boost your chances with a job offer from a competitor. Perhaps the absolute best way to get what you want from your current employer is to prove that you can get it somewhere else. If you can get a job offer from another employer that includes the amount of vacation time you want, you win regardless of the outcome of your negotiations. There are one of two possibilities: your employer will either agree to give you the amount of vacation time you want, or you'll be able to leave for the other job (and get the amount of vacation time you want). Either way, you come out ahead, so don't be afraid to leverage this aggressive strategy if you can.\n\n\nThe problem with this strategy, unfortunately, is that it requires you to put in extra effort outside of work to get the job offer in the first place. This can be difficult, especially if you're already working long hours. Don't get discouraged — many business experts agree that being employed makes you more attractive to potential employers.[15] See our resume-writing and interview-prep articles for more information!\nIt goes without saying, but you definitely don't want to do your job-searching work on the company dime. If your employer finds out you're looking for other work, you run a major risk of being let go."

            "intro": "Hamsters are great pets. They’re not only cute and fun, but they’re small enough to keep in a habitat in your bedroom. Like other animals, though, they need certain things to make sure they are healthy and happy. To care for a hamster, you should provide them with the basics, clean their cage regularly, communicate with your parents, and create a schedule to remind you when you need to do certain things.",
            "steps": [
                "Get a large enough cage. Perhaps the most important item you’ll need is a small cage or terrarium. This way, your little friend will have a safe place to play. Your terrarium should be greater than 15 inches long by 12 inches wide and 15 inches high (38 by 30 by 38 cm).[1]\n\nIf you have a lot of toys or places for your hamster to climb and explore, though, you may need a bigger cage.",
                "Provide your hamster with bedding. Line the bottom of the cage with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of bedding made of cellulose and plant-based fibers. This is important, as it will give your hamster a cozy and soft place to play, sleep, and walk through. However, avoid products that have dyes or chemicals, as they could irritate your hamster’s respiratory system. Stay away from:\n\n\nWood shavings\nCat litter\nCorn cobs\nNewspapers\nAnything with an unnatural scent or smell[2]",
                "Give your hamster some toys. Just like children, hamsters need toys to play with. Without toys, they’ll be bored and generally unhappy. To avoid this, give your hamster several different types of toys. Some include:\n\n\nA hamster wheel\nChew toys, like unpainted and untreated pieces of wood.\nWalnut shells\nHard dog biscuits[3]",
                "Feed your hamster good food. Have your parents purchase a bag of hamster food mix. These mixes include seeds, grains, vegetables, fruits, and more. Diverse food is important, as it will give your hamster all the vitamins they need to be healthy.[4]\n\nIn addition to normal food, you should give your hamster treats occasionally. While you can purchase hamster treats at the store, your little friend will really enjoy bite-sized pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables.",
                "Provide your hamster with water. Put out multiple sources of water. One good source is a shallow dish of water. Another good source is a drip bottle you can hang on the side of the cage. This way, your hamster will always have plenty of fresh and clean water.[5]\n\nChange your hamster’s water every couple of days. In addition, make sure to clean their water bowl with warm water and soap every week.",
                "Monitor the temperature in the habitat. While hamsters don’t need anything special to keep them comfortable, you should make sure that the temperature in their cage stays within certain limits. In most circumstances, the temperature in the habitat should be between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius).[6]",
                "Keep your hamster out of direct sunlight. Never put your hamster’s cage in direct sunlight. If you do, the temperature could climb very high, very fast. This could harm or even kill them. Instead, locate your hamster’s cage in a cool, shaded location with some indirect sunlight.[7]",
                "Put together a schedule and chart. Create a chart of your hamster-related duties. You can either download or create your own chart. This way, you’ll have a constant reminder of everything you need to do and when you need to do it. Once you have your chart and you’ve filled it out, post it in a place you’ll see it all the time.[8]\n\nConsider putting aside fifteen minutes before school to feed your hamster, fifteen minutes after school to feed and check on your hamster’s water, and an hour on the weekends to clean the cage.",
                "Relocate your hamster. Before you clean your hamster’s cage, you’ll have to trap it and then remove it from the cage. Do this by picking your hamster up and placing it in a temporary cage (with a top that closes). Its best to ask your parents or a sibling to help, as you might need a spare pair of hands. This is important, as your hamster could easily get out of your hands and run off.[9]",
                "Remove the old bedding. You should clean your hamster’s cage every week. When you do this, throw out whatever bedding material you used to line the bottom of the cage. This is important, as it can accumulate dirt and bacteria. If you leave it in too long, your hamster could get sick.[10]",
                "Wash the habitat. After you remove the old bedding, you need to wash down the cage. Mix light dish detergent with warm water in a small bucket. Take a clean cloth and wipe down the inside surface of the habitat. Make sure to get the corners and other hard to reach places – you don’t want bacteria to accumulate there.\n\n\nWash any toys or other objects that are in the habitat.\nAllow the habitat to dry before putting anything back in. If you want, you can take a towel and dry it down by hand.[11]",
                "Restock the bedding and replace toys and other objects. After you've washed the habitat and allowed it to dry, you need to restock the habitat with bedding. Again, make sure to line the floor of the cage with 1 to 2 (2.5 to 5 cm) inches of your chosen bedding product.",
                "Wash your hands. Before touching your hamster, thoroughly wash your hands with antibacterial soap. This is important, as you don’t want to introduce bacteria or other contaminants into your hamster’s cage. In addition, you need to make sure you wash off any chemicals that could potentially poison your hamster.",
                "Be quiet and gentle when you pick your hamster up. Be silent or very quiet when approaching your hamster or it may get scared. When you go to pick your hamster up, gently cup your hands around it. Then, slowly raise the hamster out of its cage and onto a safe surface.",
                "Secure the door on the hamster’s cage. When you are done handling your hamster, place it carefully in its cage and close the door. This is important, as your hamster could easily escape if you leave the cage door or top unsecured.",
                "Tell your parents if you think your hamster looks sick. If you notice that your hamster seems sick, behaves weird, or has had any noticeable change over a short amount of time, you should tell your parents immediately. Some things to look out for include:\n\n\nWeight loss\nLoss of hair\nDiarrhea\nLack of energy\nWatery eyes\nProblems breathing[12]",
                "Ask your parents before you take your hamster out of the cage. Especially when you first get your hamster, you should let your parents know before you take it out of the cage. This is important, as your hamster could jump out of your hands, run under the door, and get lost in your house.\n\n\nGo to your parents and ask politely, “I’d like to take the hamster out of its cage. Is this okay?”",
                "Let your parents know if you get low on supplies. Since you’re the primary caretaker of your hamster, your parents likely won’t know if you’re running low on food, bedding, and other supplies. As a result, you’ll need to let them know when you are getting low. Make sure to give them several days’ notice so they have plenty of time to go with you to the pet store to get more supplies."

                "Do not go overboard buying hydroponics supplies that they may need in the future but will not need in the beginning stages of hydroponic gardening. To begin your hydroponic gardening project you will only need a few things to get you off to a great start. Many of the items you need for hydroponics can already be found around your house so you can save money before you go full tilt into this hobby or found all together in a hydroponic garden.",
                "Create a dedicated area for their gardening. Most newbie gardeners can either purchase an easy to install grow room or build a greenhouse outside of their home. Small grow rooms for the beginning hydroponic gardener are usually slightly larger than a closet and can be completely installed in under an hour. The cost ranges from several hundred dollars to over $500, depending on the add-ons that you think you will need.",
                "Get the right hydroponic supplies. A small greenhouse can cost considerably more because you will need to either include a cement floor and drainage system or lay other types of flooring such as gravel before you build the greenhouse itself. Many small greenhouses cost anywhere from $500 to over several thousand dollars, depending on the add-ons you choose.\n\n\nThe basic items you need after you decide on either a grow room or greenhouse include a temperature control unit, exhaust fan, heating mats, light fixtures for your blue and red spectrum lights, an aeration system (an aquarium system works well for small gardens), pearlite, marble and Styrofoam work well as a beginning medium and rockwool, oasis or Rapid Rooters. Typical beginning tables for your plants include plastic tubs, a child’s swimming pool or fish tank. A gardener can also buy any of the items they need for their grow room from stores specializing in hydroponic supplies.",
                "Choose the seed you want to grow. Make sure that it can be grown where you live (don't choose a citrus plant if you're living in Alaska, for instance) and that it isn't a plant that is grown underground.",

What you do next depends on the type of plant.\n\n\nIf the seed has a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through.\nIf the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves.",
                "Watch the seedling(s) carefully so that they grow straight. This is a very fragile time in their life, so be extremely gentle.",
                "Move your plant into its permanent container when the seedling is stronger and bigger.",
                "Fill the container with water. You can choose between having one plant per container, or doing a larger container with many plants. If you choose the second option, make sure that all the plants have good support.",
                "Place your grown seedling into the water, so that only the roots are submerged. If you are growing a plant that gets much taller, you should probably tape a support to the side of the container.",
                "Change the water every few days, especially if it seems to get murky or translucent. Also, plants need nutrients to grow, so buy a pack of liquid fertilizer to add to the water every week. Follow the package instructions, and don't overfeed the plants.",
                "If you chose a plant that bears fruit, watch for flower buds growing near the leaves. They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable.\n\n\nIf the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates.",
                "Make sure that the flowers don't weigh the stem down, if you chose a flowering plant. Normally, plants can anchor themselves into the dirt for extra support. Check your plant's stem daily for any cracks or bending points.",
                "Harvest the fruit/vegetables like any other plant. Enjoy your hydroponic garden!"

        "How to Replace a Refrigerator Door Seal": {
            "intro": "A faulty or leaking refrigerator door wastes energy. Leaks can also increase your energy bill and stress your refrigerator, shortening its life. You also risk spoiling your food. Changing the door seal (often called a gasket) may be necessary, but it's not that difficult of a process.",
            "steps": [
                "Understanding what a gasket or door seal is. Every refrigerator has one. This is a gasket (or seal) that is made out of molded rubber.\n\nThe goal of the gasket is to keep cold in and to keep heat out of the refrigerator. Essentially, it seals the colder air in, and prevents air outside the refrigerator from entering it.\nThe reason this matters is because a bad or worn seal will allow cold air to leave the refrigerator, and warm air to enter it. This means that temperatures in the refrigerator could increase, and spoil food inside of it. It will also cost you more money in energy because of the cool air escaping.",
                "Determine whether you need to replace the door seal at all. If there are gaps between the gasket on the door and the refrigerator gasket, it’s not sealing correctly.[1]\n\nOne way to tell that you need a new gasket is if your refrigerator seems to be running more frequently, or you just think it seems like it’s losing cold air. You could also inspect the door gasket for condensation or blackish looking mold. If you see either of those things, you probably need a new gasket because the cold air is making warm air condense. If you see cracks or thinning of the gasket, it’s probably time for a new one.\nYou could also test the gasket with a dollar bill. Put the dollar bill between the refrigerator door and refrigerator, and close the door on it. Then, try to pull it out slowly. If you feel it drag slightly, your gasket doesn’t need replacing. If it slips out quickly or has moisture on it or mold, get a new gasket.\nYou will need to do one of two things: repair the gaps in the gasket or replace it altogether. Replacing a faulty seal will save you money by not wasting energy. It’s not very expensive to buy a new gasket. It just costs about $50 to $75, and it should only take about 30 minutes to replace. You will save energy, so it will pay for itself fast.[2]",
                "Consider repairing the gasket if it’s possible. Close the refrigerator door and look at the gaps. Inspect them. How big are they and where are they?\n\n\nUse petroleum jelly on the gasket to fix small gaps. Simply pull the gasket away from the channel to expose a couple of inches (.05 meter) in the door corner. Cut small strips of weather stripping. Pack the corner with it by placing it along the channel of the door gasket.\nPush the gasket back in the channel. Repeat the process, and pack other corners if you think that’s needed.\nClose the refrigerator door again and look for gaps again. If this didn’t work, and you still see gaps, you will need to replace the seal.",
                "Research the right gasket to buy. This will depend on the type of refrigerator you have, and what its model and identification information says.\n\n\nCheck the owner’s manual. If you can’t find your owner’s manual, go online and research what it says.\nGo to a hardware store or manufacturer service center, and tell them the refrigerator information. Store personnel should be able to help you find the right gasket. Check the door seal size. Measure your door.\nYou could also research the gasket on the website of the manufacturer. Be aware that if the door liner beneath the seal is cracked, you will need a new liner as well as seal (gasket).",
                "Prepare the new gasket while you’re removing the old one. It’s a good idea to put the new gasket in warm water for a few moments before installing it. Before you remove the old one, shut off the power to the refrigerator.[3]\n\nThis process will make it easier for you to install the new gasket. You also might find it easier to level the refrigerator if it seems off balance. Some people even remove the refrigerator door to install the gasket, but this is not mandatory.[4]\n\nYou won’t need a lot of equipment, but you will need what is called a hex head screwdriver. You can find these at most hardware stores. If you are confused what it is, just ask a salesperson and tell him or her the purpose. You should turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise.[5]",
                "Remove the gasket from the refrigerator door. Grab the bottom of it on the inside, and pull the gasket back. You want to be able to see the metal gasket retainer.[6]",
                "Loosen, but do not remove, the screws that hold the metal retainer around the entire door. You should use the hex head nut screwdriver to do this. Lift the edges of the seal to find the screws underneath that are holding in the plastic liner and door seal. Often, the screws hold in a plastic liner, which in turn clamps the door seal to the door.",
                "Pull the gasket out of the door to remove it once you have loosened the retainer screws. Once all of the screws are loose, the door seal should easily slide out from behind the plastic liner. Don't be too forceful when doing this step, since some plastic liners can be quite brittle and crumble if you are too rough. [7]",
                "Take the new gasket, and install it. Position one of its corners on the top of the refrigerator door. Push the lip of the new gasket over the metal retainer, and slide it behind the metal retainer and around the entire perimeter of the refrigerator door. The best method is to start in the top corners, and work your way around the door.",
                "Use the hex head driver to screw the metal retainer in. You don’t want to tighten the gasket retainer screws all the way. You want them to be snug.",
                "Apply powder. Use a bit of baby powder or talcum powder to prevent sticking.",
                "Rub some powder around the hinge side corners of the door seal and where the seal slides. This will help to prevent the door seal from twisting as it meets the metal of the fridge.",
                "If this still doesn't prevent twisting, then wedge a screwdriver under the seal as you close the door, and leave it shut for an hour.",
                "Close the refrigerator door, and open it several times to inspect the gasket. You are looking for any warped areas of the gasket. Repeat this process several times.",
                "Rub petroleum jelly along the hinged side of the door if you see some gaps. Once the gasket looks like it is properly fitted, tighten the screws more. Alternatively, you can heat the door seal up with a hair dryer to fix the gaps. This softens the door seal and allows you to stretch it."

            "intro": "Whether you want to raise money for a charity that deals with a cause close to your heart, or you want to help the family down the street, knowing how to effectively raise money can make all the difference. If you're interested in helping a non-profit organization with their cause, there may be some red tape that you'll need to cut through, but then you'll be able to focus your efforts on running the most successful fundraiser you can.",
            "steps": [
                "Review your state's regulations. Most states have specific rules and regulations regarding fundraising. Different forms must be filed from state to state and there may be taxes you need to pay depending on your cause or location. Before you begin planning a fundraiser, review your state's fundraising guidelines on your government website. If you have any questions, reach out to a local non-profit and ask for advice and insight.",
                "Get to know your audience. Knowing your audience is key to running a successful fundraiser. Try to get a sense of what types of donors flock to what types of fundraisers. This will give you a better sense of what kind of fundraiser to run.\n\n\nReview attendance records and donation records for the cause you're supporting. Look at demographics. Is the crowd older, younger, liberal, conservative? You can get a sense of what kind of fundraiser would be most successful based on this data.[1]\n\nIf you're working with an older crowd, you might want to fall back on more traditional fundraisers. Things like bake sales and charity auctions might work best. A younger crowd might be more drawn to something light and fun like a karaoke contest. Younger people also tend to be more tech savvy, so online crowd-funding campaigns may be more appealing.[2]",
                "Research the best charities, if applicable. Some charities are more effective than others, and you want to make sure that your money will be spent as well as possible. Consider charity rating websites, and testimonials from the community.\n\n\nSome charities are considered unhelpful by the community they claim to support. For example, many breast cancer awareness campaigns spend more money on hypersexualized awareness ads than on helping survivors,[3][4] and Autism Speaks exploits and dehumanizes autistic people.[5][6] Do your research, and look for charities that aren't torn with controversy.",
                "Gather like minded people. If you want to run a fundraiser, it's a tough job to do alone. Get a team together of like-minded individuals who believe in the same cause. Work together to put on a successful fundraiser.\n\n\nIn most areas, there are groups dedicated to a variety of causes. See if you can find a relevant group in your area, attend a meeting, and see if anyone is interested in helping with a fundraiser.\nChurches are also big on fundraisers. If you attend church, try seeking out help there.\nYou can advertise on websites like Facebook and Craig's List that you're looking for volunteers to help with a fundraiser.",
                "Stick to the classics. If you're catering to a more traditional audience, consider sticking to the classics. Fundraisers like bake sales and gift wrapping have existed for a long time for a reason. They work.\n\n\n\nHave a bake or craft sale. Bake sales and craft sales allow the community to participate by contribute homemade goods. If planned around a holiday, attendance is generally higher as people are looking for Christmas presents.[7]\n\n\nHost a party. This is great if you're trying to raise funds locally, or want to target your friends but not pressure them into a donation. Host a party with clear message and inform guests about the opportunity for donating. Give a short presentation on the cause during the gathering if possible.\n\nHold a car wash. Another classic fundraiser, the car wash is still an effective fundraiser, especially in the summer months.\n\nSet up a dinner fundraiser. If you're running a fundraiser for a larger organization, you can try a fundraising dinner. You'll need to find a venue and prepare the menu, but you'll be able to charge per plate, which can lead to a lot of donations.\n\nHold a raffle. If you can come up with some good prizes, you may be able to hold a raffle. Be sure to check the local regulations on holding raffles, as they may be considered gambling and require a permit.\nConsider gift wrapping if you're fundraising around Christmas. You can charge patrons a small fee to have their items custom gift wrapped for a cause.[8]",
                "Network with others. If you're interested in a bigger fundraiser, consider networking with local businesses. This can be a fun way to entice people to participate.\n\n\n\nCheck with local businesses to see if any are willing to donate prizes. This can often be accomplished by agreeing to advertise the store that donated when discussing the prizes. You can also see if a local business would be willing to host a fundraiser and put a portion of their profits towards your cause.\n\nHold an auction. Auctions can be an effective way to raise a lot of money, especially if you can get local businesses to contribute desirable prizes. A silent auction is a great way to supplement another event, as guests can take a look during a lull in the activity.\n\nSet up a booth at an event. Fairs, carnivals, sporting events, and other public gatherings can be great places to set up a booth to raise awareness for your cause and solicit donations. It will require gathering materials, but you can reuse the booth whenever you need to fundraise at another event.[9]",
                "Start a crowdfunding campaign. In recent years, crowdfunding has taken off as a potential way to run a personal fundraiser. There are a variety of websites online that allow you to create a fundraising campaign for virtually any personal cause. Anyone that visits the page can donate any amount they'd like. Many crowdfunding sites allow you to set up different tiers of donations, with the expectation that higher tiers will be rewarded in some way.\n\n\nA successful crowdfunding campaign requires a very catchy or compelling statement and description in order to stand out from the thousands of active campaigns. You'll have to advertise on social media heavily.\nDue to the newer nature of crowdfunding campaigns, it might be best to crowdfund if you're targeting a younger demographic.",
                "Host a competition. People get excited at the opportunity to compete. Consider having some kind of contest, with entry fees or entrance fees going towards your cause.\n\n\nTry a cooking or baking contest. Allow people to compete for best dish and show off their cooking and baking skills. Events like this can be a lot of fun and tend to draw in a crowd.[10]\n\nTry some kind of sporting event. Marathon charities tend to be very popular events. Try having a hockey or basketball tournament and donations can be made in the form of tickets purchased. You can also consider selling concession items at the game and putting that money towards your cause.[11]\n\nConsider a karaoke contest. Karaoke is a lot of fun and tends to draw in a big crowd. Talk to a local bar that offers karaoke and see if they'd be willing to host.[12]",
                "Contact the organization you're fundraising for. If you're fundraising for a specific organization, contact that organization beforehand. Many organizations have specific regulations that must be followed in regards to fundraising. They may also have specific ways funds are transferred to their organization. Contact the HR department of the organization you want to work with and make sure your in accordance with their policy.",
                "Advertise. Once you've settled on a campaign, you'll need to advertise. Make sure you do so appropriately and effectively.\n\n\nThe way you advertise depends on your audience. Older demographics tend to prefer traditional forms of advertisement, like flyers and radio ads. Younger demographics are most likely to make plans via social media.[13]\n\nSend out invitations if you're doing something like a dinner. A classy invitation can entice people to want to come to your event. If invitations stretch your budget, consider evites.[14]",
                "Consider setting up a bank account for the fundraiser. Many local banks will work with you to set up a fund that your donors can contribute to. This is especially useful if you are trying to collect funds for a family in the area or for a renovation project. Stop by your local bank and ask them about creating a bank account for your event.",
                "Figure out the logistics. One of the hardest parts of fundraising is the planning stage. Make sure you figure out all the logistics of planning the event.\n\n\nAssign different tasks to different people. It can help to separate duties into categories and build teams from there. One group can responsible for managing money, another responsible for booking venues, and so on.\nDouble check all your information. Make sure you're following all regulations regarding fundraisers before engaging in the event. You do not want to host a successful event only to be slapped with a fine later on.",
                "Build a strong social media presence. A strong social media presence is key for successful fundraising. Get on Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and other social media outlets.\n\n\nAsk a social media savvy friend to help if you're not familiar with these outlets yourself. A strong Facebook fan page, as well as a Twitter presence, can be a great means to spread the word of an event to many people at once.\nReach out to the right people. Blindly inviting your entire Facebook friend's list is a big no-no. You're likely to annoy people who do not live in the area or who are not interested in the cause. Stick to inviting people who you know have similar views and live near enough to attend.",
                "Itemize expenses. People are more likely to donate if they know where their money is going. Know exactly where your money will be going and be upfront with people about this. If people know that, say, $5 buys one vaccination for a child in need in a third world country they'll be motivated to give.[15]",
                "Keep records. As you'll likely have to go through some auditing process for tax purposes, keep thorough records. Keep records of who donated, how much they donated, and what the money went towards.",
                "Believe in your cause. The key to getting people to donate is genuinely believing in your cause yourself. Know as much as you can about your cause so you sincerely believe it's worth it.\n\n\nIf you know a lot about your cause, you're likely to feel more passionate about it. When you send out an e-mail or letter asking for donations, you'll sound more convicted. This can motivate people to donate.[16]\n\nPeople enjoy contributing to worthy causes. It makes them feel positive about themselves and involved in their community. The stronger you believe in your cause, the more others will want to help you out.[17]",
                "Make donating as easy as possible. The easier it is for passersby to donate to your cause, the more money you'll be likely to raise. Make it easy for potential donors to make a contribution. If you have a website set up to collect donations, ensure that it is easy to navigate. If you've set up an account at the local bank, make sure the instructions for making a deposit are clear.\n\n\nLow minimums for donations are more likely to make people feel like they can afford it.",
                "Thank each of your donors. Each person that donates should receive a message from you or your organization, thanking them for their contribution and outlining what the money will be used for. Make the donor feel good about the money that they contributed. Thanking your donor also makes it easier to get in contact again when you run another fundraiser.\n\n\nFor large organizations, its expected that a thank-you message be sent out within 48 hours of the donation.\nFor personal fundraisers, you should be working to thank people as soon as they make their donation, and again after the fundraiser is complete."

        "How to Be Romantic with Your Boyfriend": {
            "intro": "Romance is not overrated. In fact, romance is a key ingredient to any successful relationship. This doesn't mean that taking a moonlit stroll or having a candle lit dinner with your boyfriend is the only way to keep your relationship going; it does mean that you have to figure out what romance means to both of you as a couple and to work hard to give each other love and affection. If you want to know how to be romantic with your boyfriend, just follow these steps.",
            "steps": [
                "Write \"I love you\" in hidden places. Your boyfriend would expect you to write \"I love you\" at the end of a letter or a text message, but he won't expect to see it written in the steam after his shower, in the hot sauce on his morning omelet, or on a blank page of his notebook that he sees when he's about to take notes for class. Finding a creative and unique place to write \"I love you\" will make him think even more fondly of you when you're not there, and will make him feel more romantic because you've made a special effort to let him know that you care.\n\n\nJust doing this once or twice a month can really show your boyfriend that you care. You don't have to overdo it.",
                "Make him a mixed CD. This can be a CD that reminds him of \"your songs\" or one that really takes his musical tastes into account and is a mix of things you actually think he likes. Don't recommend your favorite bands if you know they aren't his thing; but if you really know what he would like, then make him a mixed CD and pop it into his car's CD player when he's not looking. When he turns on the car, he'll get a pleasant surprise.\n\n\nMake sure you know what music he listens to, what music he already owns, and what he likes before you go and do this.",
                "Make a scrapbook. Put together a scrapbook of all of your most meaningful memories. Put together photos of you together, tickets from your favorite concert, a menu from the restaurant where you first said \"I love you,\" or notes that you wrote each other throughout the course of your relationship. This can make a great anniversary or birthday gift, or you can give him the book just because.\n\n\nThis book will make him see how far you've come in your relationship, and will make him appreciate you even more.",
                "Celebrate Valentine's Day early (or late). Who says Valentine's Day is only for February 14th? If you're both busy that day, or if you just want to be romantic on a random Wednesday, then you should plan an celebrating Valentine's Day on whatever day works for you two; you can use this time to shower each other with love and affection, dress up, and eat something delicious.\n\n\nThis fake Valentine's Day will be extra fun because you both will feel like you're in on a joke.",
                "Act like a little kid. Little kids have an infinitive amount of wonder at the state of the world, along with a healthy dose of hope and optimism. So, take a day to just act like a kid with your boyfriend, and see how much your love for each other and the world grows when you do the silly things you loved to do as a kid. You two can go to a carnival, make balloon animals, finger paint, mud wrestle, or just do anything fun and silly that makes you feel more romantic and more alive. Here are some other things you can do:\n\n\nBlow soap bubbles\nBake cookies\nMake macaroni and cheese\nWatch fireworks\nEat cotton candy at a baseball game\nGo to a water park\nMake S'mores",
                "Take a pottery class together. Taking a pottery class with your boyfriend will be just as romantic as that one scene in Ghost -- except it'll be even better because you'll both be alive. You'll be getting your hands dirty, learning something new, and creating something that you can bring home and put on your coffee table, however lopsided and misshaped it may be.\n\n\nNot only will you have fun doing this, but you'll be developing even more affection for one another.",
                "Make a book of all of the emails you've written to each other. If you've spent a lot of time apart and have sent long emails to each other, or if you're just the kind of people who love sending each other emails, you should print out all of your sweet, funny, and romantic emails and put them in a book for your boyfriend. He'll read over all of your love notes and will remember all of the great times you've had and all of the memories you've shared.\n\n\nAn affectionate email can be just as romantic as a love note. Just punch holes in the emails and bind them together with thick colorful string and hand 'em over.",
                "Give him thoughtful gifts. Don't just give your boyfriend a six pack of his favorite beer and take him out to Pizza Hut. Put in an effort to figuring out what he really likes and cares about, and what gift would actually mean something to him, and what would surprise him and make him see that you've put an effort into the gift. When it comes to gifts, one size does not fit all, so try to get your boyfriend something personalized, special, and something he wouldn't think to get on his own. Remember that the best gifts are often given \"just because,\" not for a birthday or another special occasion. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n\nDoes he love hiking or camping? Get him the latest camping or hiking gear, something he's been wanting for a while.\nDoes he love fine ales or wines? Get him a subscription to a beer or wine of the month club.\nIs he a video game junkie? Get him a new game that's all the rage, or update his gaming equipment.\nIs he a concert fanatic? Find out when his favorite band is coming to town before he does and get him some tickets.",
                "Write him thoughtful notes. Not every not-in-person communication has to come through a computer or a phone. If you're going to be apart for a day or two, or even for a few hours, write him a sweet note telling him how much he means to you or how much you'll miss him while you're apart. Just telling him to have a nice day and to let him know that you're thinking of him can make all the difference.\n\n\nYou can write your note on a post-it and put it on his mirror, put the note it in his lunch bag, school bag, or work bag, or leave the note on his windshield. Part of the romance will come from the surprise.",
                "Go on meaningful dates. Though you and your boyfriend can probably have fun no matter where you go, you should make an effort to plan some dates that are special and feel really romantic. This depends on what you and your boyfriend like and the kinds of things that make you happy together. If you suggest a date that would be perfect for your boyfriend, then he'll be impressed by how much thought and effort you're putting into the relationship. Here are some ideas:\n\n\nDoes your boyfriend love baseball? Take a trip to the batting cages together.\nIs it snowing just a little bit? You're never too old to go ice skating.\nIf you both want to hang out but don't feel like going anywhere, cook your favorite meal together.\nSpend a day out on the beach or near a lake. Being near or in a body of water will make you feel more romantic.\nThink of the thing your boyfriend has always talked about doing. Make it happen.",
                "Do him favors that count. You may not think that doing your boyfriend's laundry on the week when he has a big exam coming up is very romantic, but he'll appreciate the gesture. Romance isn't all about the grand gestures, but about the little things that show your boyfriend that you really care about him and want to make him happy. Ideally, of course, you should both be doing each other favors; you should not turn in to his errand girl to win him over.\n\n\nIf he's having a really busy day, make him lunch or pick it up for him.\nStep out in the morning to bring him back some coffee and muffins if you know he doesn't have anything to eat for breakfast.\nIf you're going to the store anyway, pick him up the few items he needs so you can save him the trip.\nIf he tends to be forgetful and has a big deadline coming up, remind him when it is to show him that you're paying attention.",
                "Take the time to understand his interests. This doesn't mean you have to tag along with him and his buddies to watch Monday night football. But it does mean that you should make an effort to see why he cares about football or whatever other interests mean nothing to you. See what's behind his love for soccer, fishing, historical non-fiction, comics, or whatever else makes him tick.\n\n\nAsk him questions about these things, and see if you can come along as he explores his interests if they intrigue you. Now that's romantic.",
                "Give your boyfriend affectionate touches. Sure, most guys aren't known for their love of PDA or hand-holding, but you should still make an effort to give your boyfriend reassuring, loving touches from time to time so he knows that you care about him. Squeeze his hand at the movies; run your hand through his hair when you're waking up; give him a playful shove when you're teasing each other. You shouldn't be all over him all the time or he may get weary; just pick the right moments to touch him, at least a few times a day.\n\n\nMaking that physical connection whenever it feels right is very romantic.",
                "Give him meaningful compliments. Don't just say, \"You're so hot\" or \"I really like you.\" Let him know what it is that makes him feel so special to you. Tell him he has a great smile, that you love his sense of humor, that you admire his work ethic, or that you think he's so good at knowing exactly how you're feeling. Make a point of finding something new you like about him every so often and let him know how you really feel.\n\n\nCompliments are best delivered in person, but you can also always tell him how you feel in a love note, email, or phone call.",
                "Show him affection when you're apart. If you're spending some time apart, whether it's a week or an entire summer, you should let him know you still care. This doesn't mean that you should call him twenty times a day to see what he's doing or to make sure he's not talking to other girls; it does mean that you should check in to let him know that you care and that you're thinking about him, at least once a day.\n\n\nYou don't have to talk on the phone every single day, if you're both busy and feel like you're just doing it to check an item off your list. But you should check in at least once a day when you're apart, whether it's by calling, texting, or emailing him.\nText him to let him know you're thinking of him.\nIf you both have video phones or Skype, make a video date or two each week, so you can still see each other and remember how much you love being together.",
                "Give him an unexpected six-second kiss at least once a day. Even if you're both tired, busy, or just not feeling affectionate, you should kiss each other at least once a day. Make the effort to give him just one six-second long kiss each day, and you'll be upping the romance factor in your relationship, and strengthening your bond as a couple. Don't just give him a routine peck on the lips or cheek before you have to leave, but pick an unexpected time to kiss him.\n\n\nKissing is the most basic way to let your boyfriend know how much you care.",
                "Tell him why he's an amazing boyfriend. Don't forget to let him know exactly how much he means to you. Often, words are the best way to show affection. You can tell him in a monthly letter, or tell him casually over dinner. Make a list of at least five things that make him an amazing boyfriend, and let him know exactly what these things are, so he really sees how much he means to you.\n\n\nYou can be even more spontaneous than that. If he does something that strikes you as amazing, just tell him what it is.",
                "Give him a massage. Giving your boyfriend a massage will not only kick up the sexiness factor in your relationship, but it will also be a great way of showing him affection and letting him see that you really care. If he comes back home after a long day or work or school, make him sit down and give him a good shoulder massage. You can move to his neck, his biceps, and his lower back. Help him relax and get all of those pesky knots out of his back, and he'll be feeling your lovin' for a long time.\n\n\nFor a longer and more intimate massage, have him lie on his stomach for you.",
                "Never stop the courtship. Even if you and your boyfriend have been together for years, you shouldn't look at the relationship as a perfect union that should stay exactly the same until the end of time. You should both be working to impress each other, to keep chasing each other, and to remind each other why your relationship is so great. Don't just fall into the same old dull routine because it's \"pretty good\" and has been working thus far; take your relationship to the next level by always trying new things and keeping it interesting.\n\n\nDon't stop telling each other how much you mean to each other.\nKeep up your weekly \"date nights,\" and make sure you leave the house for most of them.\nMake sure you try something new together at least once a month, whether it's a new restaurant or a new sport.\nBe spontaneous. Go on a random weekend trip you planned the night before; sign up for a salsa class at the last minute.",
                "Tend to your looks. If you want to hold on to your boyfriend, then you can't let yourself go. Both of you should make sure you shower regularly, get your hair in good shape, and dress nicely when you're hanging out together. You can wear sweatpants on Sundays, maybe, or on another designated \"vegging out\" day, but on the whole, you should dress up when you're together like you could appear in public, even if you're not leaving the house.\n\n\nCaring for your appearance will keep you from getting complacent in your relationship and will make you and your boyfriend feel more romantic.\nYou can even make a point of dressing up extra nicely for your date nights, even if you're not going anywhere that fancy.",
                "Keep your bedroom in a sexy state. Whether you and your boyfriend are sleeping together or just hooking up, make sure you get together in a place that makes you feel romantic, not a dirty car or cluttered basement. If you can hook up in your bedroom, make sure that it's neat, clean, and that it feels like it's made just for you two to kiss each other; don't hook up near textbooks or the piles of folders you brought home from work. When you're getting intimate in the bedroom, intimacy should be the only thing on your minds.\n\n\nIf you and your boyfriend live together, this is especially important. If the room is only used for sleep and sex, you will both feel more romantic.",
                "Maintain your independence. If you want to keep your relationship feeling fresh, then you and your boyfriend have to spend some time apart. If you're always together, then you won't have as much to talk about, and you won't be able to miss each other or appreciate each other when you're apart. No matter how close you are, it's important to pursue your own interests and to hang out with your friends and families apart from each other from time to time.\n\n\nJust going out with your girlfriends without your boyfriend every week or two will give you a new appreciation of how much you love him.\nDon't be clingy or needy. Let your boyfriend go out and do his own thing now and again and he'll love you -- and feel romantic -- even more.",
                "Do activities that raise your adrenalin together. If you and your boyfriend do something romantic together that gets your blood pumping and makes you feel good, you will be guaranteed to feel more sexy and romantic. This can take the form of any kind of exercise such as long walks, hiking, biking, running, yoga, ballroom dancing, or just going to the gym together.\n\n\nA couple that works out together stays together. And stays in shape.\nRaising your adrenalin will also put you in a better mood, and will make you more fond of the person you're with."

        "wikiHow to Eat Papaya Seeds": {
            "intro": "Papaya seeds have recently caught attention as a potential health food, and while much of the evidence supporting the notion is unverified, the seeds are nontoxic and might be worth trying just in case. You can eat papaya seeds by treating them as a supplement and eating them whole, or you could grind the seeds up and use them when you would usually use pepper since the two tastes are fairly similar.",
            "steps": [
                "Choose a small papaya. Smaller papayas tend to have seeds with a milder taste, while the seeds of a large papaya tend to be more bitter.\n\n\nAs you grow accustomed to the taste of papaya seeds, you can begin getting larger fruits instead of searching out small ones all the time. Starting with small papayas can help you get used to the flavor, though.",
                "Chew directly on a few seeds.[1] Papaya seeds can be eaten whole, but for the first week or so, only chew on one or two papaya seeds a day. If you eat too many at once, you could end up overwhelming your tastebuds and digestive system.\n\n\nThe bitter, pepper-like taste of papaya seeds can be overwhelming at first, and if you rush yourself too quickly and eat too many at once, you might become discouraged from eating any more.\nAdditionally, while papaya seeds are safe to eat, consuming anything in large quantities when your stomach is not accustomed to it can cause digestive upset. Starting slowly is the best way to avoid or minimize this upset.",
                "Work your way up to a larger amount. Over the second week, gradually work up to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml), then to 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml), and finally to a full 1 tsp (5 ml) daily.\n\n\nMake things even easier on your digestive system by taking the papaya seeds with a meal heavy in protein. Doing so will make it easier to get the maximum amount of benefits from the proteolytic enzymes in the seeds, thereby improving your digestive health.",
                "Try eating the seeds with honey. If the stronger, bitter taste of papaya seed proves too strong for you, you could try taking whole papaya seeds with 1 tsp (5 ml) of honey to lessen the effect.\n\n\nWhen taking papaya seeds with honey, you should still chew the seeds a few times before swallowing them.\nAdditionally, the combination of honey and papaya seeds is thought to be an effective treatment against parasites, so taking your papaya seeds with honey has possible health benefits, as well.",
                "Crush the seeds. Use a mortar and pestle to crush up to 1 tsp (5 ml) of papaya seeds at a time, grinding them into a fine or coarse powder.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could add the clean, dry seeds directly to your pepper grinder instead of using a mortar and pestle, if desired.\nFor best results, opt for freshly crushed papaya seeds instead of seeds that were crushed some time ago.",
                "Use crushed papaya seed whenever you would use crushed peppercorn. Crushed papaya seeds work well as a substitute for black pepper and can be used in equal proportions.\n\n\nNote that the taste of papaya seeds is not exactly like pepper. Some have compared it to a blend between pepper and mustard, but when used in small quantities, the difference is not usually enough to negatively affect the food you use it on as a pepper substitute.",
                "Try seasoning meat with papaya seeds. One great way to use peppery papaya seeds is to season steak, chicken, or pork with the crushed seeds before you cook the meat.\n\n\nFor instance, you could crush 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of papaya seeds and use them to season a single serving size steak. Rub the crushed seeds on the steak and let it sit for an hour before pan-frying in a little olive oil.\nThe papain in papaya seeds acts as a meat tenderizer. The flavor itself adds flavor to the meat, and it can also help you digest the steak after it gets into your stomach.",
                "Make a papaya seed salad dressing. Another popular way to use papaya seeds is to mix them into a vinaigrette dressing, similar to the manner in which you might prepare a pepper vinaigrette.\n\n\nFor one version of papaya seed dressing, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) papaya seeds, 1/4 cup (60 ml) papaya fruit, 1/4 cup (60 ml) red onion, 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh cilantro, 1 clove garlic, 5 tsp (25 ml) ginger, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) apple cider vinegar, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) sea salt, and a pinch of chili pepper flakes if desired.\nBlend all of the ingredients, minus the oil, in a blender until they form a liquid.\nSlowly pour the olive oil into the blender or food processor as it runs to blend it in thoroughly.\nThis recipe produces 1 cup (250 ml) of papaya seed dressing. You can store it sealed and chilled for up to one week.",
                "Note the health benefits of papaya seed. Now that you know how to eat papaya seeds, you might still be wondering why you should.\n\n\nFor starters, papaya seeds contain high levels of oleic and palmitic acids. Both are believed to help protect your body against cancer.[2]\n\nIn traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine, papaya seeds are used to detoxify and strengthen the liver.\nThe flavonoids in papaya seeds are believed to help prevent germs from causing infections and are also thought to protect the kidneys.\nIn one study done with Nigerian children, 76.7 percent of the children got rid of intestinal parasites after consuming papaya seeds daily for one week.[3]",
                "Scoop the seeds out of a fresh papaya. The simplest, most effective way to get papaya seeds would be to buy or harvest fresh papaya and to scoop the seeds out of the fruit with a metal spoon.\n\n\nAfter digging the seeds out with a spoon, spread them out on one half of a clean tea or dish towel. Fold the towel over to sandwich them in the middle and rub the seeds quickly to remove any remaining, attached pieces of fruit.\nPlace the seeds in a colander and rinse them under running water. Spread them out flat near a windowsill to dry in the sunlight for a few days.\nYou could also dry the seeds using a dehydrator. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to avoid drying the seeds out too quickly or not thoroughly enough. When using a dehydrator, however, the total amount of necessary drying time is usually cut from days to hours.",
                "Store an excess in the freezer. If you do not plan on eating or using all your papaya seeds within the first few days, you should place them in a freezer-safe, airtight container and store the seeds in a freezer.\n\n\nIf you eat papaya seeds on a fairly consistent basis, you can store them in the refrigerator instead of relying on the freezer. If you do not think that you can go through your papaya seeds within a week or so, though, it is best to freeze some.\nWhen kept frozen, papaya seeds can retain their nutritional value for 6 to 12 months.\nDefrost the seeds in the refrigerator overnight before use. Alternatively, you could soak frozen seeds in hot water for a few minutes until they soften.",
                "Avoid adding them to smoothies or similarly sweet foods. Even though you could technically use papaya seeds in a smoothie, many people agree that the bitter, pepper-like taste tends to be a fairly unappetizing addition.[4]\n\nAdditionally, in low quality blenders, papaya seeds may not be thoroughly ground. A mortar and pestle, food processor, or pepper grinder are your best options if you want to pulverize papaya seeds."

They are derived from the pinecone, and when eaten, offer as many health benefits as nuts and other seeds, including vitamins A, C and D. Pine nuts are rich in monounsaturated fat. Because of their natural oils, they make a great addition to sauces like pesto, and can be roasted or pan-toasted for a healthy snack. These seeds can be cooked in the shell or already shelled, either in your oven or microwave. Use these tips to learn how to roast pine nuts.",

                "Place the baking sheet on the top rack of the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Check the nuts after this time and continue baking if their outer shells have not turned a light golden brown. Check frequently so as not to overcook.",
                "Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and leave the nuts to cool on the baking sheet for approximately 20 minutes.",
                "Shell your pine nuts. Spread the cooled pine nuts onto a dish towel. Cover the nuts with another dish towel. Roll over the nuts with a rolling pin while pressing down. The shells will break away, exposing the nut meat.",

        "wikiHow to Lose 10 Pounds Fast": {
            "intro": "It's a fairly common goal to want to drop a few pounds quickly. You might be going to a high school reunion, wedding or a beach vacation and want to lose some weight in just a few days or weeks. Losing five to ten pounds may help you feel a little better and be more confident in yourself. A quick drop in weight is fairly simple with a few changes to diet and exercise and can be achieved in about two weeks safely. However, its ideal to keep your weight loss off permanently. So although very fast weight loss may be tempting, you want to make sure you find a weight loss plan that's safe and sustainable long-term.",
            "steps": [
                "Aim to reduce your calories by 500 to 750 calories per day. Start your weight loss plan by cutting out calories from your diet. You can lose anywhere from 1–3 pounds per week by cutting out 500–750 calories each day.[1] With this plan, you should be able to lose about 10 pounds in two weeks.\n\n\nIt's not advisable to cut out more than 750 calories daily or eat fewer than 1200 calories daily. It's too difficult to consume enough essential nutrients with a diet that is overly restricted.[2]\n\nRestricting calories any more will not speed up weight loss. Remember that weight loss needs to happen gradually and healthfully.\nYou can find a relatively accurate calorie counter online which can guide you on how many calories you currently consume and how many you can cut from your diet.",
                "Focus on lean protein, fruits, and vegetables. Making your plate half protein and half fruits and vegetables is a good plan for quick weight loss. These foods are low in calories and high in essential nutrients. In addition, they will keep you feeling satisfied longer compared to carbohydrate based foods.[3]\n\nMake sure to include a source of lean protein at each meal. One serving of lean protein is about 3–4 ounces or about the size of a check book.\nLean protein options include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, pork, seafood, tofu and legumes.\nAlso include either a fruit or vegetable at each meal. Aim for 1–2 servings of fruit daily (1/2 cup or 1 small fruit)[4] and 3–5 servings of vegetables daily (1 cup or 2 cups leafy greens).[5]\n\nSample meals include: baked salmon and broccoli, grilled chicken salad, shrimp and vegetable stir fry, and vegetable and cheese omelet.",
                "Limit carbohydrates. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates, especially when whole grain, are a part of a healthy diet. However, limiting these foods has been shown to help support quicker weight loss.[6]\n\nWhile carbohydrates can be included when there is more time allotted for weight loss, it is essential to cut carbohydrates when trying to lose weight fast.\nWhole grains are grains that are minimally processed and contain all the nutrient-dense parts of the grain (the germ, bran, and endosperm). These types of grains are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients.[7] If you choose have grains, try to choose 100% whole grains like: quinoa, oats, 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice.\nRefined carbohydrates are generally very processed and low in nutrients (like fiber).[8] Limit the following types of foods: bread, rice, pasta, bagels, crackers, pretzels, chips, muffins, tortillas, or quinoa.\nYou can choose to cut out these foods altogether or allow 1–2 servings daily. You may notice quicker weight loss with fewer servings of these carbohydrate rich foods.\nIf choosing to include grains, choose 100% whole grain options when you can. Whole grains are much higher in fiber and other nutrients compared to refined grains.[9]",
                "Include 1–2 high protein snacks. Protein is an essential nutrient that will help support quick weight loss and help reach your 10 pound goal in about two weeks. Depending on your calorie level, you should include 1–2 high protein snacks daily.[10]\n\nHigh protein snacks that will support weight loss include: one individual greek yogurt, one hard boiled egg, 2 oz beef jerky or protein bar, or shake.\nSnacks should be between 100–200 calories per snack. Higher calorie snacks may slow your weight loss.[11]",
                "Cut out liquid calories. Sodas, sugary coffee drinks, fruit juices, sports drinks, and alcoholic beverages usually contain a significant amount of calories. Drinking these daily will slow or inhibit your weight loss. Replace them with sugar-free, clear beverages.\n\n\nAim for 64 oz or about 2 L of clear, sugar-free beverages daily. This will help keep you hydrated throughout the day.[12]\n\nBeverages to sip all day long include: water, sugar-free flavored water, and decaf coffee or tea.",
                "Avoid fad diets. It's tempting to give in to trendy fad diets that promise great weight loss in very short amounts of time. However, many times these diets are unhealthy, unsafe, and not sustainable for long periods of time. In addition, you're more likely to gain your weight back.[13]\n\nAvoid diets that ban entire groups of foods or encourage you to eat very, very small portions or a diet that is less than 1200 calories daily.[14]\n\nAlso avoid diets that promote using liquids or \"cleanses\" as these can cause adverse health effects.\nAlso be wary of diets that encourage the use of supplements or diet pills to help induce quick weight loss. Again, these are most likely not safe and will not cause long-term weight loss.[15]",
                "Aim to do at least 75 minutes of intense cardio activity or 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every week. Cardio exercises will help you burn additional calories to support quicker weight loss.[16] More exercise may help you reach your 10 pound goal within a 2 week time period.\n\n\nVigorous intensity aerobic exercises are activities that raise your heart rate and breathing pace very high. You shouldn't be able to say more than a few words at one time. Moderate intensity cardio also increases your heart rate and breathing level, however you should be able to say short sentences with ease.[17]\n\nExamples of vigorous exercise might include: running, spin classes, high intensity interval training, or boxing.\nExamples of moderate intensity exercise might include: walking/jogging, dancing, or using the elliptical machine.\nIf you can, spend more time doing aerobic exercises each week. You can help speed up your weight loss with additional activity.\nTry HIIT training, which consists of intervals of high and low intensity, is a great way to lose weight quickly as it is very good at promoting fat loss.\nBe careful of high amounts or very high intensity workouts with a low-calorie diet. You need to eat enough to support your exercise. That's why it's important to never go below 1,200 calories daily — especially when you're working out.",
                "Learn to use free weights or weight machines. Strength training may not result in a quick 10 pound weight loss, but it may help tone your body. This may be desirable if you're trying to lose weight for a specific event like a wedding or class reunion.\n\n\nStrength training for 30 minutes three times per week will speed up weight loss as it speeds up your metabolism. However, this happens over longer periods of time.[18]\n\nLearn proper form with a physical therapist or personal trainer before you work out with weights on your own. Use a mirror as you begin to check your posture and avoid injury.\nDo bodyweight exercises. Also ask a personal trainer to teach you how to do planks, side planks, mountain climbers, push ups and pull ups. Flow yoga, barre, pilates, and TRX bands are great ways to learn body weight exercises.",
                "Plan 1–2 active rest days. It's important to allow your body to rest a few days a week. Constantly exercising without rest can put you at risk for overuse injuries.[19]\n\nActive rest days help you recover from previous exercise but also keep you moving (and burning calories). You are not participating in your regular moderate or high intensity exercise, but are not taking the entire day off of activity. Schedule in low-impact or relaxing exercises like yoga or walking.\nSchedule in about 1–2 active rest days each week. They should follow days of very high intensity exercise or strength training days.",
                "Weigh yourself. Record your starting weight. Plan to weigh yourself at least every couple days to keep track of your progress.\n\n\nStudies have shown that people who weigh themselves are more conscious about their weight and their eating habits. If you are opposed to weighing yourself daily, make sure you are weighing in every week to mark your progress.[20]\n\nContinue to weigh yourself after you meet your weight goal. This will help you notice any unwanted fluctuations — like a weight gain.",
                "Continue with regular exercise. Regular physical activity is not just for weight loss. In fact, exercise has shown to be more important for weight maintenance than weight loss.[21]\n\nContinue with a routine that you enjoy. You may not need to workout as much or at a high intensity, but it's important to continue with about 150 minutes of moderate activity each week.\nAlso continue with your strength training. This will help support your weight maintenance long-term.[22]",
                "Indulge occasionally. Although you may have met your weight loss goal, that doesn't mean you can ditch the healthy eating plan. To maintain that weight loss you have to continue with a healthy, well-balanced diet. That means indulging in favorite foods, but only doing so occasionally.\n\n\nAn indulgence can be anything — a sweet treat, a dinner out or two alcoholic beverages at a happy hour. These should only be occurring every so often — maybe 1–2 times a week. However, you should define what occasionally means for you.\nIf these types of treats are popping up more often, you're more likely to gain some of your weight back.\nWhen you do know that you'll be indulging, try to compensate in other areas of your diet or lifestyle. Perhaps you spend more time at the gym or do a harder workout or eat lighter throughout the day."

        "wikiHow to Stop Coughing in 5 Minutes": {
            "intro": "A persistent cough is painful and frustrating. It can be caused by everything from a dry throat to sinus drainage to asthma. The key to combating your cough quickly is selecting the right solution for your type of cough.",
            "steps": [
                "Reach for fluids. As with any illness, staying hydrated is your first line of defense against coughing. If your cough stems from a dry throat, a little hydration might be all you need. Even if your cough is caused by something else, drinking plenty of fluids is never a bad idea.[1]\n\nIf your throat is raw or irritated from coughing, be sure to avoid beverages that might irritate it further, such as acidic juices like orange juice.\nBe careful with dairy, too. While the notion that milk makes more mucus is a myth, milk — particularly whole milk — might coat your throat and make you feel as though you have more phlegm. On the other hand, if your cough is caused by irritation or dryness, cold dairy products might be soothing.[2][3]\n\nWhen in doubt, always choose water.",
                "Make the fluids warm. For certain coughs, such as ones caused by congestion or sinus drainage, warm liquids can be even more effective than cold or room temperature ones.\n\n\nWhether it’s the perennial favorite of herbal tea with honey or just hot water with lemon, “[a]ny warm liquid can help break up mucus in your airways,” according to the American Lung Association’s chief medical officer.[4]",
                "Try saltwater. Particularly in cases of cold- or flu-related coughs, salt water is your friend.\n\n\nEither gargling with salt water or using a saline-based nasal spray can help kill the viruses or bacteria causing the postnasal drip that’s making you cough along with giving some short-term relief by flushing mucus out of your throat.",
                "Consider steam — in some cases. Conventional wisdom often dictates that steam from a shower or a humidifier can help combat a cough; however, that’s only the case if your cough is due to dry air.\n\n\nIf you’re coughing because of congestion, asthma, dust mites, or mold, among other causes, moist air could actually make your cough worse.[5]",
                "Stay upright. Being horizontal can cause mucus to drain into your throat.\n\n\nWhen sleeping with a cough, for example, you should prop up your head with pillows to prevent sinus drainage from pooling in your throat, causing you to cough.[6]",
                "Keep the air clean. Stay away from dirty air, including cigarette smoke.[7] Particulates in the air could either be the source of your cough or worsen one that has other causes.\n\n\nStrong fragrances, such as perfumes, can cause some people to cough, even if they’re not irritating to others.[8]",
                "Keep the air still. Avoid wind, ceiling fans, heaters, and air conditioners, because moving air can make coughs worse.[9]\n\nMany cough sufferers believe that blowing air makes their cough worse, either by further drying their airways or by producing additional tickling sensations likely to trigger a cough.",
                "Try breathing exercises. While most breathing exercises are aimed at those with chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they can be used by anyone struggling with a cough.\n\n\nYou can try “controlled coughing” or “pursed lip breathing,” among other techniques. In pursed lip breathing, for example, you begin by taking a deep breath through your nose and counting to two. Then, while pursing your lips as if you’re about to whistle, you slowly exhale to the count of four.[10][11]",
                "Reach for the medicine. If your cough persists, consider trying anti-cough medicines.\n\n\nCough medicines usually combine two ingredients: an expectorant, which loosens mucus, and a suppressant, which blocks the cough reflex. Check the labels to pick the one that’s best for your cough.[12]\n\nYour doctor may be able to prescribe a cough syrup containing codeine, which can be a very effective cough suppressant. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions exactly as outlined by your doctor, as codeine has the potential to become habit-forming.",
                "Sooth your throat. Consider sucking on throat lozenges, eating frozen treats (such as popsicles), or gargling with salt water to sooth your throat if your cough has inflamed it.[13]\n\nMany cough medicines contain a mild anesthetic to decrease the cough reflex. Likewise, cold items, such as popsicles, are thought to work by temporarily numbing the throat.[14]",
                "Try menthol products. Whether in the form of lozenges, ointments, or vapors, menthol has been shown to alleviate coughing.[15][16]\n\nMenthol raises the \"cough threshold,\" which that in increases the severity of sensations necessary to trigger a cough.[17]",
                "Know when to see the doctor. If your cough is accompanied by shortness of breath, bloody mucus, severe pain, or a fever above 100.4°F (38°C) among other severe symptoms, consider seeing a doctor.[18]"

        "wikiHow to Become a Marketing Manager": {
            "intro": "The duties and responsibilities of a marketing manager will vary depending on the company size and industry. As a marketing manager, you will typically be responsible for planing, directing, and coordinating marketing policies, as well as developing and implementing pricing strategies for your company or outside clients.[1] You might be a one-person team or part of a large staff of marketing directors, managers and assistants. Learning how to pursue a career in marketing management can start you on a lucrative fulfilling life path.",
            "steps": [
                "Take relevant high school courses. If you think a career in marketing management might be right for you, it's best to take relevant courses as early as possible. This will help you determine if you have a lasting interest in marketing.\n\n\nTaking courses in economics, finance, statistics, and computer science (if your school offers these classes) will help prepare you for the necessary college degree path.[2]",
                "Apply to college programs. You will need a minimum of a bachelor's degree to become a marketing manager. Some colleges have an actual bachelor's degree in marketing management, while others offer related degree paths like marketing, business, business law, and communications.[3]\n\nLook for accredited colleges and universities with a school of business or business administration.\nDecide what's important to you in a school. Does a hands-on internship program offered through the school sound appealing? What about job placement?[4]\n\nMake a pros and cons list of which colleges and universities in your area offer the most well-ranked programs, and size up which aspects of each college are most important to you.[5]",
                "Join an interest club or attend seminars. Some schools (especially larger universities) host school-wide interest clubs. These can be an excellent way to make connections, learn more about your chosen field, and build your resume with additional experience.\n\n\nSome schools offer marketing clubs unique to that college or university.[6]\n\nMany larger colleges have local chapters of nationally-recognized organizations, such as the American Marketing Association.[7]\n\nCertain honor societies specialize in business, marketing, and management. For example, Sigma Iota Epsilon (SIE) is a national management honor society that could provide great networking opportunities.[8]\n\nAny career-focused clubs, interest groups/organizations, and honor societies that you join will look great on a resume. Even if you struggle to make time for extra-curricular activities, this is one activity you should absolutely make the time for.",
                "Get an internship. Some employers consider internships a requirement for any applicant hoping to become a marketing manager.[9] Many of these internships offer hands-on experience working at real companies and firms to learn how the business works and what a career in marketing management will look like for graduates.[10]\n\nSome colleges offer internships through the school, or through the business, marketing, or management departments.\nLook for internships that specifically deal with marketing, sales, or public relations experience.[11]\n\nIf your school does not have any relevant internships set up for students, you can find internships online by searching for marketing or management internships in your area.\nIf you know of a particular business you'd like to intern with, check their website for internship information or reach out to a human resources employee.",
                "Graduate with a bachelor degree. Once you've completed your coursework and gained some extra-curricular experience (including clubs or honor societies and a hands-on internship), you'll graduate with a bachelor's degree in your chosen field. You'll need to have high grades in all of your coursework if you plan on attending a master's program, so make sure you apply yourself completely during your collegiate studies.",
                "Consider attending graduate school. Some employers may require that you have a master's degree or professional degree. Others may simply require a well-rounded undergraduate education with a lot of hands-on experience. The best way to determine whether you'll need to advance to graduate school is by researching your dream companies and seeing what their requirements are.[12]\n\nIf your dream job requires an advanced degree, or if you believe that an advanced degree will open up additional career opportunities for you, you may want to consider applying to graduate school.[13]\n\nTalk to professors you worked well with in your undergraduate studies to see if grad school may be right for you.\nSearch online for accredited graduate school programs that focus on marketing, business administration, or business management.",
                "Choose a career path. There are many career paths that are available for someone with a marketing or marketing management degree. Which career path you choose will depend on your personal interests and talents, your ultimate career goals, and the specific educational and work experience you've gained. Some common career paths include[14]:\n\n\nbrand management\nsales\nmarket research/analysis\nadvertising\npharmaceutical marketing\nretail marketing\nhigh-tech marketing (management, marketing, and sales of tech products like computers, software, system services, and other aspects of the high-tech industry)\nmarketing consultant\nconsumer analysis\nbusiness-to-business marketing[15]",
                "Research potential employers. If you know what niche you'd like to work in, you may have already identified numerous potential employers. If you have not yet narrowed down your search, look at where the most jobs are available in your area.\n\n\nThe majority of marketing managers work in advertising, public relations, and other related industries.[16]\n\nMany marketing managers also work in information technology, retail trade, and wholesale trade.\nA number of marketing managers also work in managing companies and enterprises, especially those that deal with marketing in some capacity.",
                "Know what characteristics employers want. Before you apply for a job as a marketing manager, you should know what kinds of skills and characteristics employers typically look for. The exact requirements for each job will vary, depending on the company you apply to and the field you are seeking work in. Common skills/characteristics sought in a marketing manager include, but are not limited to:\n\n\ninitiative\nleadership and management abilities\nteamwork capabilities\nanalytical thinking\nstrategic abilities\ninnovative/creative thinking skills\ncommunication skills\nstrong organizational skills\ntime management[17]\n\na business-savvy mindset\nability to work under pressure and meet deadlines[18]",
                "Attend networking events. Networking events can be a great way to make connections with potential employers. Even if you leave a networking event without a job offer, you will still get a much better understanding of what employers are looking for in an employee, and you may make a connection that could lead to a potential job down the line.\n\n\nYou can find networking events through your alumni association, or through professional associations that focus on marketing management.\nMany professional conferences incorporate some kind of reception hour or networking event. This can be a great way to meet other people already working in your desired field and to learn what it takes to succeed.[19]",
                "Search online job listings. You can find employment listings by searching online for relevant professional associations. They often list job openings or post links to outside career opportunities. Don't be frustrated with having to look for entry-level positions - odds are you won't find many managerial positions if you're just out of college with minimal work experience.\n\n\nLook at job boards through professional association websites like the American Marketing Association (AMA).[20]\n\nTalk to alumni from your school and any network connections you've made about possible places to work.\nAsk your former professors how they got their start in marketing management.",
                "Put together your resume. Begin your resume by listing your education in reverse-chronological order, with most recent degree listed first, followed by professional experience (including internships). Then list any leadership experience, relevant skills, and membership in any relevant clubs/associations.[21]\n\nAs you list your skills and experience, you may want to highlight exceptional experience by using the kind of language employers look for in a marketing manager.[22]\n\nWhere relevant, use terms like \"coordinated,\" \"managed,\" and \"led,\" whether it's regarding teams, projects, or work loads.\nHighlight any relevant analytical skills/experience by mentioning things like \"analyzed pricing patterns,\" \"assessed market opportunities,\" or \"synthesized market reports\" (if relevant to your experience).\nMention anything you designed, developed, negotiated, or communicated in previous jobs/internships.\nDo not fabricate or exaggerate work experience. Most employers follow up with references and check on your credentials, and giving any kind of misleading or fabricated information may result in your dismissal.",
                "Give a strong interview. Before arriving for your interview, you should read up on the company's earnings calls, quarterly reports, mission statement, and any company blog posts.[23] As with any job interview, you should arrive early and dress professionally - a suit and tie for men, and a work-appropriate blouse, pants or skirt, and blazer for women.[24] Common questions asked during the interview include:\n\n\nCan you walk me through your resume?\nWhy are you interested in this company?\nHow would your peers describe you?\nWhat do you think are the most important characteristics for this position?[25]\n\nCan you tell me about a time you had to manage a crisis?\nHow do you manage your workload?[26]\n\nWhat's your greatest weakness?[27]\n\nWhy should we hire you/what can you do for the company?[28]",
                "Gain work experience. If you built a strong resume, made a good impression, and gave the right answers during the interview, there's a good chance that you'll receive a job offer from one of the places you applied to. If you don't get an interview, don't worry - you can learn from your mistakes to develop stronger interview skills and rewrite your resume to highlight the kind of information employers are looking for. Keep trying and you will eventually land your dream job.\n\n\nDon't get frustrated if you don't get a managerial position right out of college. You may have to take an entry-level position and work your way up to manager.\nThink of every job you work as another piece of experience to list on your resume that will help you get your dream job.",
                "Develop and implement pricing strategies. As you begin working in marketing management, you'll quickly need to make decisions on how to develop and implement pricing strategies for your clients. A big part of this involves learning what your potential customers are like, and what they're willing to spend. This may entail learning about your typical buyer's persona, conducting surveys/interviews with existing customers, and analyzing the data you've assembled. Ultimately you want to create a pricing strategy that can maximize your company's profits while still valuing your customers' loyalty.[29]\n\nConsider what prices your competition is charging for their goods/services.\nAnalyze market data to compare the highest market price, the lowest market price, and the average.\nLow rates will risk lowering the quality of your client's services to avoid losing money.\nRates that are too high may force your client to sell their products/services through a niche market or an exclusive retail outlet.\nA good middle ground might be to offer an average price for the goods/services being sold, while allowing individual representatives to offer discounts to customers if it means increasing sales during a slow period.[30]",
                "Create a strategic marketing plan. A strong marketing plan should motivate your employees, lead your company down a clear path to success, and detail the specifics of how to implement those marketing strategies.[31] A strong, coherent marketing plan should do each of the following:\n\n\nassess your company or client's current situation (in terms of finances, resources, opportunities, threats, strengths, and weaknesses)\nlay out your business mission/vision, your business objectives, your marketing objectives, and a description of your target market/customers\noutline your product message, pricing strategy, and desired communication channels/methods\ndetermine your restrictions (including budget/resource limitations)\noutline your benchmarks and measurement process (including factors that will determine success, performance indicators/criteria, and desired technology solutions)[32]",
                "Coordinate marketing policies. If you want your company/client to succeed, you will need to coordinate the marketing and sales departments. Having these two departments work together will help streamline the process from reaching out to customers to making a final sale. It will also help keep your customers satisfied with the product/service they're getting, the lifestyle that product/service conveys, and the price they pay for it.[33]\n\nHave your marketing team work together with your salesforce to ensure that timely, quality service and a streamlined process are carried out at all levels.\nMake sure your salesforce knows how their products are being marketed. By the same token, ensure that your marketing department understands the challenges that your salesforce faces.\nUnderstand the needs of your local market, and develop collaborative approaches between your departments to meet those needs and exceed expectations.[34]\n\nMake your employees aware of the responsibilities and deadlines that are faced by both the marketing and sales departments, and work together to find strategies beneficial to everyone.\nConsider coordinating policies in more practical ways. For example, you might have your salesforce work through various marketing and distribution channels, including telemarketing, mailed advertisements/offers, and catalogues."

            "intro": "There are many different scents of cologne and it can feel overwhelming which one to choose and how to apply it correctly. Whether you are trying to impress a date, be more put together, have a signature scent, or you just want to experiment with something new, cologne is easy and fun to use and can improve your confidence and overall impression on others.",
            "steps": [
                "Wear cologne with oriental or wood notes in the fall and winter. You can choose to wear cologne with the seasons by avoiding light and floral scents in the cold months and instead wearing earthy colognes like sandalwood, cedar, and vetiver to complement the weather.[1]",
                "Choose a cologne with floral and fresh notes in the spring and summer. As the weather gets warmer, wear cologne that enhances the season. Floral, fruity, green, water, and citrus scented colognes are great for the warmer months. [2]",
                "Select a cologne with musky and spicy scents for nighttime. Whether you are going to a dinner date, out to a party, or are getting dressed up for a work event, cologne is a great way to enhance your evening appearance. Choose colognes with musky, woody, oriental, spicy, and mossy notes for night.[3]",
                "Wear cologne with citrus and floral scents for daytime. You don’t want to wear an overpowering strong scent during the day. For everyday use at work or school you can choose to wear fragrances that are lighter and softer, such as citrus, floral, fresh, and sweet scents.[4]",
                "Test different colognes until you find your signature scent. Instead of changing your cologne with the seasons or for the time of day, consider having one fragrance that is your signature scent. Try a variety of different colognes until you find one that you feel represents you and that you want to wear on a daily basis. Consider asking others what they think of your signature scent when deciding.[5]",
                "Choose a cologne that is long lasting if you don’t want to re-apply throughout the day. Choose a cologne with a high oil content if you want the cologne to last for many hours. Select a cologne with a low oil content if you are worried about it being too strong and overpowering.[6]",
                "Go to department and makeup stores to search for cologne. You can find cologne for sale at many stores such as Sephora, Ulta, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and CVS. Going to a store in person is important so you can test the different options and find what works best for you. Buying cologne online is good if you already know what cologne you want, but otherwise it does not work because you can’t test it.[7]",
                "Smell coffee or tea in between testing each cologne to refresh your palate. If you do not do this the smell of the previous cologne will get in the way of and cloud your judgement of the new scent.[8]",
                "Spray the cologne on your wrist to test it. You can also spray it on each inner elbow if you want a stronger scent. Avoid testing the cologne on the paper cards at the store because you cannot get the full scent this way and you will not know how it smells on you.[9]",
                "Wait before purchasing anything to get a full sense of the smell. You should wait at least an hour before purchasing the cologne you like. The scent can change over time as it mixes with your skin. You can even ask for sample vials of your favorite scent if you want to test a few throughout the week before committing to a scent you really like. [10]",
                "Ask other people’s opinions. The opinions of other people (friends, family, significant others) can help you decide if you want to purchase a cologne. If multiple people tell you a certain scent is not a good choice, consider purchasing a different scent.\n\n\nIf someone recommends a cologne, don’t purchase it without testing it.[11]\n\nIf you want someone’s opinion on the spot, take someone you trust shopping with you.[12]",
                "Follow your own gut when deciding what to buy. Although the thoughts of other people can help you make a decision, it is also important to choose something that you like and to trust your own views. Don’t let someone else choose the cologne for you.[13]",
                "Buy a small bottle if you are new to using cologne. You might realize after you buy it that you don’t want to wear it very often or that your taste is different than you thought. Most cologne comes in bottles ranging from 1 oz (29 ml) to 3.4 oz (100 ml). If you know you love a cologne and will use it often, you can purchase a large bottle.[14]",
                "Search around for the best price of the cologne you want. Although you can purchase the cologne at the store you found it in, once you found the cologne you like you can search at other stores to see if you can find it for a lower price. You can also see if you can find the cologne available online. Discount websites often sell cologne that was an unused tester at a store and eBay often has unopened colognes that someone received as a gift or changed their minds about.[15]",
                "Apply the cologne to your wrists, chest, and elbows. Choose 2-3 of the warmest places on your body (chest, neck, lower jaw, wrist, forearm, inner elbow, and shoulder) to apply the cologne. If it is your first time wearing cologne, just apply one spray at first to one area then branch out after you get more comfortable and used to wearing cologne.[16]",
                "Apply the cologne after a shower. In order to maximize the effects of the fragrance, apply it after a long, warm shower. Your pores will open in the shower, making the scent stronger. Mixing cologne with body odor will make an unpleasant scent, so make sure you are clean before applying.\n\n\nChoose fragrance-free or light scented soap and deodorant. Mixing cologne with strong scented body soaps and deodorant covers up or alters the smell of the cologne.[17]",
                "Spray the perfume 3–6 inches (7.6–15 cm) away from you on dry skin. After spraying the cologne onto your skin, do not rub it in. It might seem like this will help put the scent into your pores, but it will actually break the molecular bond of the cologne. This can weaken the scent and strength of the fragrance.\n\n\nMake sure to apply non-spray cologne carefully without splashing. Take a finger and press it on the opening of the bottle, tip it over gently, and apply it to your skin.[18]",
                "Only apply the fragrance to your skin and not to your clothes or in the air. Spraying cologne onto your clothes does not allow it to mix with your natural oils, causing you to lose notes of scent. It might also stain the fabric of your clothes. If you spray the cologne in the air and walk through it, most of the cologne will end up falling to the floor and not onto you.[19]",
                "Be careful not to apply too much cologne. Using too much cologne is overwhelming and can make you repulsive.[20] The type of skin you have can make you more or less susceptible to fragrances clinging to your skin. People with oily skin should be extra careful when applying cologne, but men with dry skin can apply a little extra without it being too strong.[21]",
                "Store the cologne in a cool and dark room. Cologne should be stored properly in order to make sure you get the most out of your purchase. In order to make sure your bottle does not go bad, keep it away from heat, light, and oxygen. Optionally, you can even store your bottle of cologne in a refrigerator.[22]"

        "How to Know if You Have Ringworm": {
            "intro": "Ringworm is a skin infection that is caused by fungi called dermatophytes. These fungi are microscopic organisms that thrive on the dead tissues of the skin, hair and nails. It is called ringworm because of the characteristic rings of blisters and scaly skin that form once the infection spreads.[1] You can contract ringworm if you come into contact with a person or animal who has ringworm and if you share items like hats, brushes, combs, towels, and clothing with an infected person.[2] Ringworm is easily remedied if the symptoms are detected early. If you are looking for information on how to treat ringworm, click here.",
            "steps": [
                "Check for scaly skin on your scalp. Ringworm can cause small patches of scaly skin on the scalp to develop. These spots may be sore and itchy.[3]\n\nSometimes scaly skin can be an indication you have dandruff, not ringworm. If you start to notice this symptom, get your scalp examined by a dermatologist to determine if you have a ringworm infection.",
                "Note if you experience hair loss. Hair loss caused by ringworm starts in small patches that are generally the size of a coin. As the disease progresses, the hair loss spot will start to grow in size and may form a ring shape, hence the name “ringworm”.[4]\n\nYour hair may break off, leaving stubble that looks like small black dots. The bald patches may be scaly and swollen.",
                "Look for small, red sores on your scalp. As scalp ringworm progresses, small, pus-filled sores can begin to develop on the scalp, called a kerion. The skin may also begin to \"crust\" —it will look like very dry flaky skin that you can peel off. These are all signs that the infection has gotten worse and requires immediate medical care.[5]\n\nIf you have oozing and tender sores on your scalp, you should get them treated right away as they can cause permanent scarring and hair loss.\nIf you have a kerion, you may also develop a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Your body will try to fight the ringworm by raising the temperature of your body, leading to a fever. Your lymph nodes will also swell as they try to get the infection out of your blood.[6]",
                "Note any red blisters on your face, neck, or hands. Body ringworm can appear on your face, your neck, and your hands, often in the form of red blisters in a ring shape.[7]\n\nIf you have ringworm on your face and neck, you may have itchy, swollen skin that becomes dry and crusty; however, these symptoms may not appear in a ring shape. If you develop beard ringworm, you may notice chunks of hair are missing from your beard.\nHand ringworm can cause the skin of your palms and your fingers to appear thicker or raised. It may affect one hand or both hands, and your hands may appear normal on one side and thicker or raised on the other side.\nIn more severe cases, the red blisters on your body can spread, grow in size and merge. These blisters will be slightly raised when touched and very itchy. Pus filled sores may also start to develop around the rings.",
                "Check for groin ringworm. Groin ringworm, also known as Jock Itch, is a type of body ringworm that generally forms around the inner thighs and buttocks. Look for red or brown sores in these areas, though they may not appear in the shape of a ring. These sores may also be pus filled.[8]\n\nYou may also have large patches of red or itchy skin in your inner thigh and buttocks areas. However, ringworm will generally not affect the genital area.",
                "Look for red and flaky rashes between your toes. In the case of foot ringworm, also known as Athlete’s Foot, rashes will appear between your toes. You will also most likely experience an itching sensation that you can’t seem to get rid of. As the ringworm continues to progress, you may begin to feel a burning or stinging sensation on your feet and toes.[9]\n\nYou should also check the soles and sides of your feet for flakiness that resembles scales. If your ringworm has progressed this far, you should seek immediate medical care.\nYou can also get ringworm in your nails, also known as a fungal nail infection. Your nails may turn black, white, yellow, or green, they may turn brittle and fall off, or the skin around your nails may become sore.[10]",
                "Practice good gym and locker room hygiene. Like many fungal infections, ringworm thrives in moist environments. Limit your exposure to ringworm by wearing shower shoes in the locker room and washing your hands before and after every workout. You should also always wipe down gym equipment, including workout mats, before and after use to prevent the spread of an infection.[11]\n\nAs soon as you are done with your workout, you should change out of your gym clothes so you are not wearing sweaty clothing that can allow fungi to thrive and grow. You should also never share your towel when you workout and wash all clothing and towels after every use.\nIf you swim at a public pool, you should practice good locker room and pool hygiene. Always wear shoes in the showers and shower before and after you go into the water.\nMake sure you dry off completely after showering.",
                "Do not share hair brushes, combs, towels, clothing, or other personal care items. Prevent the spread of ringworm by not lending out any personal care items, especially if ringworm has been going around your classroom or your office. Keep your hair brushes, combs, sporting equipment, and towels clean so you do not encourage the growth of fungus like ringworm.[12]",
                "Get your pets checked for ringworm. If your pet has fur or hair, she may have bald spots in her fur or hair, as well as red blisters or scaly skin. Take your pet to the vet to check her for ringworm, as you can contract ringworm from an infected pet.[13]\n\nAvoid touching your pet if she has ringworm and wear gloves around her. You should also wash your hands before and after touching any animal in the event they are carrying a fungal infection."
