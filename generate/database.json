            "Build confidence. This will help with you understanding your natural beauty, in and out. Stand straight. Smile at yourself. Notice the positive things. It is all important. Embrace your flaws, but enhance your good features. Below are tips in order to help you.",
            "Take care of your skin and body. Keep up with your personal hygiene. Shower every day to leave you smelling fresh and feeling renewed. Wash your body with sweet smelling body wash, and wash your hair every other day as washing it daily can make your scalp dry and flaky. If your hair is naturally oily, consider a clarifying shampoo to prevent your hair from producing excess oil. Clean your hair by massaging your scalp with shampoo using your fingertips. Rinse and repeat twice. Then wash with conditioner for shine and to prevent tangling. Massage into your hair for 20 seconds and leave it in for 2 minutes. Rinse and repeat. Deodorant is highly recommended.\n\n\nWash your face regularly. This will unclog your pores and help get rid of acne. Use an oil-free face cleanser twice a day and in a week or two, your skin will be clearer and new. Remember to dampen your face with warm water before you wash your face; it opens your pores. Rinse with cold water after you wash your face to close them. Having clear skin makes you look as if you care about your skin.",
            "Fix your hair. One of the things we spend the most time on in the morning is our hair. So try to embrace the natural look, but you can always add accessories. You can still do some cute hairstyles that don't show your natural hair as much such as the sock bun. If your hair is wavy, you can still put it in a ponytail. Also, try to get haircuts more often than you usually do so your hair does not grow with split ends.\n\n\nBe mindful when using heated cosmetics. These can damage your hair by drying it out and ultimately cause split ends. It is recommended that you only use heated cosmetics for special occasions.",
            "Apply makeup. Try not to go overboard with makeup. Embrace the natural you; people don't like a girl who isn't cool with being herself. But, if you must have makeup, do a little mascara, eyeliner, lip gloss, and some foundation. Liquid foundation looks much better than powder because it makes your skin look more natural and blended.",
            "Exercise. Get your heart rate up for at least 60 minutes a day, and in a week you will notice the weight loss and toning of the body. Remember to only lose weight if your BMI is higher than average.",
            "Eat healthily. Eating fruits and vegetables give you the energy you need and make you look great. It improves your complexion too. Follow the suggested serving portions of the food pyramid and make sure you get the nutrients you need. If you're having trouble eating healthy, throw out most tempting foods and only have one night a week when you can eat some junk food. Remember to wash your hands before eating. in addition never forget to drink right amount of water. Water protects you from lots of problems and it can make your skin shine!",

    "wikiHow to Write a Family History": {
        "intro": "Writing a family history can be a very special project to undertake. Not only will you find answers to the mystery of your ancestors' lives, but you will also compile a document that your future family members can use for generations to come. But family histories can be very large projects to manage. Having a clear plan of your scope and research resources will help you create an accessible text for your entire family.",
        "steps": [
            "Define the scope of your history. Not all family histories have to be massive recordings of multiple generations. You could just create a story of your immediate family -- your parents and siblings or your spouse and children.[1]\n\nGet a rough idea of how far back in history you intend to search. This will help you decide what kinds of resources you need to explore.\nIn addition to deciding how many ancestors you want to include, you should also consider if there is a particular geographical location you want to stick to. If your ancestors immigrated, do you want to conduct research about their lives in another country or do you want to keep it centered in one specific location?",
            "Define a research question. Similar to deciding on your scope, a clear research question will help guide your research. Is there a particular ancestral figure you want to focus on?[2]\n\nFor instance, do you want to know why one branch of your family moved to another region of the country? Do you want to know the source of an old feud with another family? Asking something specific will help you narrow your scope and then branch out into other information.[3]\n\nDecide what you already know. How much information do your already have on your family? What gaps in knowledge exist? How do you intend to fill them?",
            "Locate and analyze important records. In the digital age, resources for finding information on your family can be easily accessed on the internet. Here are some types of records that can help you build a family history:[4]\n\nLand deeds and records (often available about the National Archives' web site for the U.S. as well as the records division of your local county courthouse)\nCensus information (available at the U.S. Census Bureau's web site)\nMilitary records (National Archives)\nShip passenger arrival records and land border entries (National Archives and The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc. web sites)\nEngagement/wedding announcements, birth announcements and obituaries (often in local newspapers or church bulletins)\nSchool yearbooks or old transcripts (usually available from the person's alma mater)\nLegal documents such as wills and testaments (also available at their corresponding courthouse)\nChurch registries (check with local churches if you know your family has a history there)\nOld letters, journals or diaries from ancestors (ask older relatives if they have these)\nFamily recipes and/or cookbooks",
            "Seek out visual resources. While records and written documents will give you important facts, visual sources will make your history more engaging to read. Look for old family photographs, maps of land, posters, postcards, and newspaper clippings to include. Nothing will make your history feel more alive than actual depictions of your ancestors.[5]\n\nLook for other physical items such as childhood toys, clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, and mementos/keepsakes kept by your older family members to include in your family history. These items will give you a sense of your relatives' tastes and interests beyond a basic genealogical record.",
            "Use a genealogy library. Genealogy libraries specialize in resources for finding your family history. They often include extensive microfilm collections where you can read a variety of helpful sources all in one space.[6]\n\nSome of the most well-known genealogy libraries in the U.S. include the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Midwest Genealogy Center, the Family History Center in Salt Lake City, the New England Historic Genealogical Research Center Library, and the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in Houston.[7]\n\nYou may find that taking the time to visit one of these libraries will actually save you time in the long run because of the wealth of resources they provide all in one place.\nYou should also check your local library system to see what kind of genealogical resources they provide.",
            "Embrace on-line resources. If you are limited in your ability to travel to libraries, then try to use on-line resources. Web sites such as Ancestry, AfriGeneas, Find A Grave, Archives.com, and Genealogy provides lots of great tips for starting your family history.[8]\n\nThey will often provide timelines and checklists so you can properly organize the information that you are gathering and save it in a digital space.\nOn-line resources will also be convenient for sharing materials and records with other family members if you don't plan to send a physical copy of your family history to many readers.[9]",
            "Conduct interviews. Sometimes the best historical sources are your current relatives. As you are gathering information, structure your interview around want you want to know. Do you want to hear about a particular time or period in this subject's life or do you want a general overview of their family history?[10]\n\nSchedule the interview for a time and place that is convenient for your subject. This may be in their own home or in a more public place.\nDocument the interview. You should plan to take notes during the discussion -- don't just assume that you will remember everything afterwards. If you don't want to take notes, try to record the interview with a recorder or video camera.[11]\n\nAsk important questions. These should include fact-finding questions (like the names of relatives/dates of important events), but you can also ask substantial questions about family traditions or customs, family trips, and how your subject related to their local communities.\nRespect sensitive subjects. Over the course of a person's life, they may experience something very painful or have a moment they do not want to revisit. Respect your interviewee when they say they don't want to discuss something -- don't push them or make them feel uncomfortable.[12]\n\nIf you do not know your interview subject well, consider asking if a close friend or relative of theirs will accompany you during the interview. This might make your subject more comfortable while they are talking to you if you are a stranger.[13]",
            "Decide on an organizational format. Some genealogical histories are simply lists of names, birth and death dates, marriages and offspring. While this is a good place to start, it probably won't give a very in-depth view of the personalities belonging to the people in your family.[14]\n\nFocus on narrating the story of your family rather than simply making lists on a family tree. Give details about your ancestors based on the research you have compiled. Did the family suffer financial ruin at one point? Did they have any disputes in court? Did anyone commit a major crime? These are the kind of substantial details that can make your history a compelling text to read.\nConsider if you want to divide sections of your history by time or by geography. For example, if one branch of your family is from one state, but another branch of the family still lives in a different country, consider dividing the family history into regional or geographical sections rather than by a historical timeline.",
            "Make your history accessible. If you are putting your history into a book format, you should have some tools that will make it easily accessible for your reader. The most helpful tools will be a Table of Contents (so your reader knows how the history is structured) and then an Index of Names at the back.\n\n\nThe Index will be especially helpful to a reader who wants to learn about one member of the family in particular.[15]",
            "Try a non-chronological organization. You don't have to follow each family member's life from the moment of their birth to their death. Opening a chapter with the sentence, \"Beauregard Fortiscue was born on October 9, 1875\" will often put the reader to sleep because they already sense the arc of this story.[16]\n\nInstead, open with a compelling anecdote about your subject. Have you found a long lost love letter from Beauregard to his wife? Do you have evidence that he was entangled in a bitter land dispute with a neighbor? These are more compelling stories to use as an introduction to his history and they will hook your reader early on.",
            "Document your sources. There are number of style guides you can use for correctly citing your sources, such as the Chicago Manual of Style or Modern Language Association style book. Pick one style guide and apply it to the sources in your project.[17]\n\nYou will generally need to cite a source whenever you directly quote from it or whenever you refer to it generally (as when you paraphrase or summarize a section from it).\nMost citations require the name of the author of the source, the date it was published, and the title of the work (such as The Journal of Beauregard Fortiscue, 1888-89).\nSources from records such as the census or other similar documents should also be cited. Consult the style guide for specific instructions on how to cite it properly.",
            "Join a writing group. The best way to improve your writing is to get feedback from other readers. Consider joining a local writing group (often hosted at local libraries or community centers).[18]\n\nIf you have some extra money, you can also consider taking a class in non-fiction writing at your local college to help improve your writing skills.\nWriting groups will also give you a set of deadlines to meet while you are drafting your project.",
            "Proofread for correct grammar and spelling. You can also hire a proofreader to help you with this if you want to spend more time focusing on the content of the story. Try looking for local freelance writers or even asking students in a graduate writing program if they want to take on a side project.[19]",
            "Publish your history. Self-publishing might be the best route for your family history; it is likely that your broadest audience is your own family (and future family members), so most major publishers will not take on your project. But there are lots of options for self-publishing today:[20]\n\nLook for local printers who use Xerox DocuTech if you only want to print a limited number of copies. These are often lower-cost options that also provide a quick turnaround.[21]\n\nConsider print-on-demand publishing. On web sites like Lulu, you can print one book at a time directly from a computer file (rates begin at $13 for 24 pages). This is a good option if you think you might only want a couple copies of your history.[22]\n\nYou can also turn your history into an e-book for free on web sites like Scribd.[23]",
            "Consider other digital formats. While you might assume that your family history should take the form of a book, there are many other formats to consider as well.\n\n\nThe website PlaceStories allows you to pick notable addresses on a digital map and then attach stories to them. You can consider using this site if you want to base your history geographically.[24]\n\nVlog your research. You can also make a series of videos in which you discuss your research and then upload them to sites such as YouTube or Vimeo if you want to orally tell the story of your family.[25]\n\nConsider using a digital newsletter that you can email to your friends and family. Each newsletter can feature a story about a different relative in your family history and it will present the information in easily digestible chunks as opposed to one long book. You can use services like MailChimp or ConstantContact to create these kinds of newsletters and mailing lists.",
            "Embrace the benefits for your family. In a survey conducted by Ancestry.com, more than 67% of users reported that learning about their family histories made them feel wiser; a majority of users also reported that it helped them feel closer to older relatives.[26]\n\nIf you have been looking for a way to get closer to relatives you don't know very well or whom you have lost touch with, then researching a family history can be a great way to do this.",
            "Reclaim history for yourself. If your family belongs to a marginalized or oppressed group, writing a family history can also help you dismantle racist or stereotypical narratives about your family's ethnic or religious background. Writing can become an act of empowerment for your family and broader community.[27]",
            "Reap the health benefits of writing. Writing can have significant benefits for your mental and physical health. Studies have shown that writing can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.[28] It has also been show to reduce symptoms in cancer patients.[29]\n\nNot surprisingly, the mental work of writing has also been shown to boost your memory.[30]"

    "wikiHow to Get Through Tough Times": {
        "intro": "Life changes can leave you reeling and feeling unsure of what to do next. Whether it’s coping with financial problems, dealing with death or trying to heal from a divorce, it’s not always easy to figure out what your next step should be. However, there are things that you can do to reduce your stress even when life takes those unexpected turns.",
        "steps": [
            "Acknowledge your emotions. You may want to ignore the painful feelings the situation brings up or pretend your feelings do not exist. Recognize that by pushing your feelings away, you create more negative emotions. It’s better to accept your feelings and work through them. Don’t try to rationalize the way you feel; the only way to work through your emotions is by feeling them.\n\n\nFor example, if you lose your job, it’s okay to admit you feel angry, upset, fearful, and vengeful.\nSet aside 15 minutes each day to feel your emotions. Don’t let your mind interfere, just sit and feel what you feel.[1]\n\nYou can journal your thoughts and feelings.\nDon’t be afraid to cry. Crying releases negative chemicals from the body, and also helps relieve stress, lift your mood, and help you deal with painful circumstances.[2]",
            "Modify your thinking. Try to view the situation as an opportunity to grow and improve.[3] For example, try reminding yourself of how strong and resilient you are during tough times. When you look at things from this perspective, it’s a lot more empowering.\n\n\nIf you didn’t get into the college you wanted to attend, your world isn’t over and you won’t lose your shot at having a career. Remember that you have options and that positive things will come of the situation.\nTry to keep your worries in perspective. Try asking yourself, “Is this worry really that bad in the grand scheme of things?” If you are worried about something in the future, ask yourself, “How likely is it that this will really happen?”\nIf you find that you are worrying incessantly, try choosing a “worry time.” At the beginning of each day, select a 15 minute time interval, in advance, when you can worry about your problems. If thoughts of any problems try to intrude outside of the designated “worry time,” then remind yourself that it’s not “worry time” yet.",
            "Face your reality gap. Often life gives you one option when you wanted an entirely different option. The greater distance between what you have and what you want, the greater pain you may experience.[4] Recognize that the reality you wanted did not come true, and you must now live in a different reality.\n\n\nInstead of resenting your situation, acknowledge that you must adapt to your situation. For instance, if you lack financial resources, don’t keep spending money like you did before. Acknowledge that your spending habits may need to change.",
            "Practice acceptance. Many things in life are out of your control, from the traffic on the highway to your boss being irritable at work. Instead of getting wound up and irritated at these situations, take a breath and practice accepting what is out of your control. While you cannot control the situation, you can control your reaction.\n\n\nYou can practice acceptance through meditation. Write a list of all the things that are out of your control. Then, close your eyes and slow your breathing until you are in a meditative state. Imagine handing your list over to a higher power and letting those things go.[5]",
            "Give gratitude. Even in the most dire of circumstances, having a grateful attitude can provide a much needed perspective that widens your experience beyond your current pain.[6] Even if you feel like you have lost many things, take a moment and acknowledge what you do have, especially the non-material things such as friendship, physical ability, or pleasant weather.\n\n\nSet aside time each day to reflect on what you are grateful for: you may be grateful for your dog, your children, a beautiful sunset, a pleasant walk, or a much-needed phone call with your sister. Take a few moments and express gratitude for these things.\nRemember the toughest points in your life, then remember that you are right here, having successfully worked through those situations and the dark times. You were able to endure that before, and you can endure this now.",
            "Be resilient. Resiliency is engaging the process of adapting to changes, whether they be temporary, life-long, or crisis situations. Look at the big picture and don’t see difficulties as never-ending. They will end, and you will get through it.[7]\n\nResiliency doesn’t develop when stress is removed from life, it develops when you’re exposed to stress and have adequate time and tools to recover.[8]\n\nFor example, you may break your leg and not be able to walk for quite some time. Resiliency means finding ways to adapt to your new situation-- like excelling at physical therapy to build up strength, and getting good with a wheelchair or crutches-- knowing that you as a person will prevail, even if your ability changes.\nReflect on past difficulties and what you gained from them. Some people report feeling more confident in their abilities or having a deeper appreciation of life.[9] Know that there is likely some lessons for you to learn through this experience.",
            "Practice spirituality. Many people find spirituality helpful when coping with difficult events.[10] Some positive spiritual coping methods include calling in support from a higher power, spiritual forgiveness, reframing the situation from a meaningful benevolent framework, and meditating on positive things.[11]",
            "Problem solve. While many problems require time and healing, some problems can be solved with a little effort and thoughtful consideration. Think about problems you are facing that may have a solution. This can include work, finances, family, friendships, romantic relationship, and educational stresses. Write down as many solutions as you can think of for each item that you listed. It doesn’t matter whether a particular solution seems realistic or not, just write them all down.[12] It’s amazing which solutions can actually be helpful, so you don’t want to disregard any of them in the initial brainstorming session.\n\n\nFor example, if you and your partner always talk about finances right before bed and end up going to bed angry, start moving your discussions to the morning and have enough time to adequately talk through all issues.\nOnce you know what the solutions are, be sure to create a specific actionable plan to move forward. This will probably require you to identify specific goals and the action steps that you will take to meet the goals.\nFor more information on goal attainment, check out How to Set Goals and Achieve Them.",
            "Ask for support. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or advice. If you are overwhelmed or if you don’t know what to do about something, there are many people who are willing to help. Whether you talk about your difficulties with family, friends, or a therapist, it can be cathartic to verbally express what’s going on to someone else.[13] Don’t try to do it all alone. Trying to live life without support only intensifies the struggle and makes life feel worse.\n\n\nDon’t let pride get in the way of you seeking help. No one knows everything and you can always reciprocate later.\nTalking about your problems can allow someone to give you unique perspective that you may not have considered.\nWhen you talk to someone else, let them know what you want. If you want feedback, ask for thoughts or feelings regarding your situation. If you just want someone to listen, make that clear. Sometimes well-intentioned people will give you feedback to try and solve your problem when all you want is to vent.",
            "Prioritize self-care. Despite your hardships, much of life may need to go on, including taking care of kids or putting in 40 hours at your job. While getting through this difficult time, make sure you are doing things to care for your body and your emotions.[14] It can be easy to stretch yourself thin meeting other peoples’ needs, but make time to meet your own needs, too. Be sure that you are eating healthy, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and intentionally creating joy in your life. Find things you enjoy doing and do them.\n\n\nTreat your body to a massage.\nFind time to journal and express your thoughts and emotions.\nFind 20 minutes each day to meditate or take a power nap.\nTake a walk or go for a hike if you don’t have the time or energy to go to the gym.\nLaughing decreases stress.[15] Watch funny wipeout videos or silly animal videos to keep you laughing.\nStaying positive also helps. Always search for the silver lining in everything.[16]",
            "Take a break. If you feel overwhelmed by your life situation, take a break. A break can come in many forms: it can be a vacation, a weekend getaway, or even a long walk. Taking a break can even be engaging in distraction, such as reading a book, watching a movie, or going to the gym.[17]\n\nFind out what distractions help you cope (not run away from your problems). Find activities you enjoy and go do them! This can also include going hiking, horseback riding, or writing in a journal.",
            "Engage in therapy. Sometimes it can be most helpful to talk to a mental health professional when dealing with difficult times. A therapist is someone who is there to support you and ask questions that help you gain a different perspective. A therapist can help you uncover the root of your problems, work through emotional struggles, and help you make positive changes in your life.[18]\n\nTherapy helps you explore yourself and your situation in a way that encourages growth.\nA therapist can be helpful in a number of situations. If you experience job stress, relationship problems, or difficulty coping, a therapist can help.",
            "Help others. When going through crisis, much of your attention gets placed onto yourself and your situation, which can eventually be draining. Set aside some time to volunteer and help others to put your focus on other people. You can increase your own happiness by helping others.[19]\n\nOffer to help out a friend with errands.\nVolunteer your time at an animal shelter and help orphaned animals.\nVolunteer once a week with children or older adults."

    "wikiHow to Be a Good Catholic": {
        "intro": "One of the easiest ways to be a good Catholic is simply to pray. Keep prayer short and simple; don't ask for things such as money, girls, health for yourself, but rather focus on others. Check out Solomon's prayer and God's response (I Kings iii.5-14).",
        "steps": [
            "Receive God's provision: The important thing is to know God's love! Realize Jesus gave his all, as He died to give us life! No matter what, as Catholics, we believe that through the Sacrament of Confession or Reconciliation, God forgives our worst sins. Do not despair but hope in God. If we look at the lives of the saints, many of them were as far away from God as you could ever imagine; but they were able to change their lives around, serve God, and enter joyfully into His Heavenly Kingdom.",
            "Respect Him in prayer and revere His presence! God is with us at all times, even when we think we are alone. Try to be aware of His presence which is all powerful, all knowing, and all loving. Love Him who first loved the world.",

Mass is the source and summit of our Faith as the Bread and Wine offered at Mass according to Church doctrine becomes the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Also frequently praying and partaking of the Sacraments brings us closer to God and makes us stronger in our Faith. There are numerous prayers that have been written throughout the Catholic Tradition. Some parishes sell Catholic prayer books to help you with your prayer. Pray the Rosary (at the bottom of the article), say the Our Father, the Jesus Prayer, or just have a conversation with God. Remember to ask for the intercession of Jesus Christ to the Father, and that of Holy Mary, the Mother of God and the saints in your prayer. We are not worshiping the saints and Mary but praying (communicating) with them to God.",

Hold true to the Traditions of the Faith as the Faith has been passed down from Jesus Christ to the Apostles to their disciplines through the numerous saints to this present day.

Continue for at least 3 to 4 hours, or until the child's urine becomes clear in color. Increase the amount gradually as vomiting subsides.[1]\n\nNote that room temperature fluids might be easiest to swallow, especially if your child is vomiting or nauseous.",
            "Continue usual feedings for infants. If your baby is still on breastmilk or formula, continue feeding it to him or her. You may need to give smaller amounts at more frequent intervals if your baby has a hard time keeping fluids down.[2]\n\nFor formula-fed babies suffering with diarrhea, switch to a lactose-free formula until symptoms improve. Lactose can be difficult to digest and may worsen the diarrhea, thereby worsening the dehydration, too.\nDo not dilute formula any further than the instructions or your doctor advise.\nYou may need to alternate both oral rehydration solution and breastmilk/formula. Consider giving your baby a sip of oral rehydration solution each time you offer him or her a bottle of breastmilk or formula.",
            "Avoid potentially harmful foods and drinks. Certain foods and drinks can make dehydration worse, so it's important to avoid giving them to your child until he or she improves.[3]\n\nPlain water can actually be dangerous when a child is dehydrated. The body loses salts and minerals during dehydration, and plain water can dilute this already low concentration of essential minerals even further.\nSimilarly, sports drinks replenish lost electrolytes, but only those lost through sweating. If your child is dehydrated due to diarrhea or vomiting, sports drinks will not be able to replenish the minerals he or she has lost.\nAvoid milk, caffeine, undiluted fruit juice, and gelatin. Caffeine worsens dehydration. Milk, fruit juice, and gelatin can worsen the vomiting or diarrhea causing your child's dehydration, thereby making the condition more severe.",
            "Prevent recurring episodes. Once you succeed in rehydrating the child, you should continue monitoring his or her condition closely. Careful treatment may prevent another episode of dehydration.\n\n\nIncrease the amount of fluids your child intakes while ill, especially if he or she suffers with diarrhea or vomiting. Breastmilk and formula are best for infants. Cold water, popsicles, diluted juice, and ice chips are best for older children.\nAvoid foods that may make vomiting and dehydration worse. These include fatty foods, foods high in sugar, lean meats, complex carbohydrates, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.\nFevers and sore throats can make it more difficult for children to intake fluids, so children suffering with these symptoms may also be given acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",
            "Assess the severity. Mild to moderate dehydration in adults can usually be cured at home without much risk of complication, but severe dehydration will require emergency medical care.[4]\n\nAdults with mild to moderate dehydration may experience increased thirst, a dry or sticky mouth, difficulty urinating, dark yellow urine, skin that feels dry or cool to the touch, headaches, and muscle cramps.\nAdults experiencing severe dehydration will likely have a lack of urination, amber-colored urine, shriveled skin, irritability, confusion, dizziness, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, listlessness, shock, delirium, or unconsciousness.",
            "Take in clear fluids. Plain water and drinks containing electrolytes are your best options. As a general rule, you should drink as much as you can without making any nausea or vomiting worse.\n\n\nMost adults need between 2 and 3 quarts (2 and 3 liters) of fluids per day.\nIf you're dehydrated due to nausea or a sore throat, try sucking on ice chips or popsicles made from juices and sports drinks.\nElectrolyte imbalance is not as grave a danger in adults as it is in children, but it's still something worth noting. Consider drinking oral rehydration solutions or sports drinks to help replenish some of the electrolytes your body loses when it becomes dehydrated. Oral rehydration solutions are best if you're dehydrated due to illness, but sports drinks work well if you're dehydrated due to overexertion.",
            "Cool down. Acute dehydration is often caused by exposure to excessive heat or accompanied by an elevated body temperature. In either circumstance, you should try to cool down to prevent the body from losing additional water content.[5]\n\nRemove excess clothing and loosen necessary clothing so that it doesn't smother the skin.\nSit in a cool area. Move into an air-conditioned building if possible. If this isn't possible, sit in the shade outdoors or sit near an electric fan indoors.\nCool the skin with water. Place a wet towel around the neck or on the forehead. Mist exposed skin with lukewarm water using a spray bottle.\nNote that the cooling process must happen gradually. Exposure to excessive cold can cause the blood vessels to body to shiver, thereby raising its internal temperature. For this reason, do not attempt to use ice packs or ice water to cool the skin.",
            "Control any associated gastrointestinal symptoms. When dehydration is caused by vomiting or diarrhea, you should try to control these symptoms through diet and medication to prevent any additional loss of water.[6]\n\nIn many cases, over-the-counter loperamide can control diarrhea. Do not use this medication if you have a fever or if there is blood mixed in with the diarrhea, however.\nUse acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for help controlling any fever you might have. Ibuprofen can irritate the stomach lining and may make vomiting worse.\nStick with clear fluids, including broths and gelatins, for the first 24 hours. As the vomiting and diarrhea subside, gradually reintroduce bland foods back into your diet.",
            "Drink more fluids. The average adult male needs approximately 13 cups (3 L) of fluid daily, while the average adult woman needs about 9 cups (2.2 L).[7] Increase your fluid intake to match or slightly exceed these ideal amounts.\n\n\nWater is important, but these recommendations refer to the overall amount of necessary fluid and not the necessary amount of plain water.\nThat being said, certain beverages are better than others. Water, herbal tea, juice, sports drinks, and other electrolyte beverages will help hydrate you, but drinks with caffeine (coffee, soda, black tea) or alcohol can actually make dehydration worse.",
            "Consume the right fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables with high water content can help replenish lost fluids. Since these foods also contain nutrients, salts, and sugars, they can help restore the proper balance of electrolytes, too.[8]\n\nBananas are a notably excellent choice. The water content of a banana can be as high as 75 percent, and they're also rich in potassium, a mineral that tends to decrease as dehydration worsens.\nAdditional fruits and vegetables worth consuming for the sake of hydration include watermelon, tomatoes, grapes, peaches, cantaloupe, strawberries, cranberries, apples, blackberries, apricots, cucumbers, broccoli, and zucchini.",
            "Drink decaffeinated tea. Chamomile tea, in particular, can be especially helpful when treating chronic dehydration. Nearly any herbal tea or other naturally decaffeinated tea can help replenish lost water content, however.\n\n\nChamomile tea is considered to be a natural pain reliever, which is one main it is recognized as a powerful treatment for dehydration. As the body becomes dehydrated, stomach muscles may begin cramping. Chamomile tea is an effective way to rehydrate the body while treating those cramps.",
            "Try coconut water. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes, so it can actually be better for chronic dehydration than standard water.\n\n\nAmong other nutrients, it contains notable amounts of iron and potassium. Both of these nutrients tend to be depleted as the body grows more dehydrated.\nNote that coconut water is different from coconut milk. For the sake of curing dehydration, coconut water is the better option of the two.",
            "Take an Epsom salt bath. Fill the bathtub with hot water and dissolve 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of Epsom salts. Once the salt dissolves, soak in the bath for roughly 15 minutes.[9]\n\nYour body can absorb magnesium from the bathwater through the skin, which may reduce any inflammation, fatigue, or soreness caused by chronic dehydration.[10]\n\nThe sulfates in the salt water can also aid in your body's ability to absorb nutrients, which may make it easier for your body to correct its electrolyte levels."

    "wikiHow to Restore Your Faith in Humanity": {
        "intro": "We are all born receptive to love, kindness and hope. As we grow up, we encounter the less hopeful, more challenging aspects of being human, including noticing world issues such as poverty and discrimination, and discovering that the things humans do at times can be hateful, calculating and unkind. Although this can turn us cynical or leave us feeling helpless, human beings are just as capable of the most incredible, amazing and wonderful kindness and love. If you're feeling a little jaded about where humanity is headed, here are some active ways to restore your faith.",
        "steps": [
            "Spend time with children. If you don't have children in your life regularly, you're missing out on the wonders of seeing the world through new, inquisitive and creative eyes. Children are less prone to willful blindness or inability to see injustices and problems. Just by being around children more, and really listening to them and paying attention to what they do, you can start to uncurl from your crusty shell of cynicism and let yourself become more childlike, playful and creative.\n\n\nChildren can cut through the layers of obfuscation which adults use to excuse stupid decisions, procrastination and inaction. Children also don't mind displaying a sense of awe about the world around them, constantly delighting in new discoveries and in making amazing new connections – between ideas, people and the wider world.\nRecognize in your time spent with children that we are born as blank slates, not for causing harm or trouble to others. Having a fixed view of human beings as cruel, mean-spirited and selfishly adhering only to what's best for each person is both unhelpful and generally untrue.",
            "Ask people to tell you about the happiest moments in their lives. How often do you ask people to recall the happy memories and what makes them happy now? People love talking about what they care about, what motivates them and what makes them happy and yet it's not always an obvious topic for general conversation.\n\n\nIt's really important to provide the space for people to open up about their happy moments – it helps them to articulate in front of an audience what matters most to them (and may thereby inspire them even further) and it will help you to see the lighter, brighter and happier side of the people in your life.",
            "Focus on the good news stories, the stories of great kindness and virtuous actions. There is a plethora of positive, inspiring and uplifting stories about the good that people do each day. Yet, much of this positive news gets buried under the sensational, negative coverage that news media seems to prefer. All the same, it is possible to actively choose to increase your exposure to positive news. For example, you can subscribe to news feeds online that only focus on positive stories. And you can selectively follow social media network friends and fans who deliberately choose to share good news rather than bad and who are regularly sharing inspiring things.\n\nCheck out such sites as the Good News Network[1], Happy News[2], The Huffington Post Good News[3], or Daily Good.[4] These sorts of sites focus on positive news stories and gather together many kind, caring and warm tales about the good things that human beings do.",
            "Check out your favorite charities online and actually read what their staff and volunteers are doing. Whether it's the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, the local zoo trying to conserve animals or a faith-based charity, informing yourself about their activities will remind you that people are actively involved in helping others, conserving the environment, restoring the land, caring for animal welfare and lobbying government to make changes that will improve lives and livelihoods.\n\n\nBrowse your local bookstore or library shelves for amazing stories about people in the business world who are transforming society at the same time as running a business. Such businesses are changing the way we \"do business\" and see the world, including in such areas as sharing of information, making games that educate as well as bring enjoyment, selling fair trade or fairly sourced products, producing eco-friendly items and financial projects that help people to borrow for or invest in small projects that benefit many people in local communities. Social entrepreneurs focus heavily on ensuring that their business makes a positive difference in the world.",
            "Spend time helping people less fortunate than you. A reality check can come in the form of looking at people who are experiencing things 10 times or 100 times worse than you are and yet manage to meet each day with passion and positivity, believing that being alive is its own reward. You can help them, but they can just as much help you.\n\n\nRather than simply reading about such people, get involved through volunteering so that you can see face-to-face the hardships experienced by others. For example, you might consider volunteering at a hospice, a hospital for children with terminal diseases or in a disaster relief community where people have lost homes and livelihoods.\nHowever bad things may seem for you, seeing the pluck and determination of those undergoing severe hardships can help you to realize that human beings really are amazing, resilient and deeply profound. It can also help you to balance your own woes and keep them in perspective.",
            "Think about the things that people do for which you are profoundly grateful. If you begin looking for reasons to be grateful, there is a big chance that you'll find them in other people's actions every single day. For example, the driver who kindly lets you into the lane instead of speeding up, the shopper who waves you in front of their place in the queue because you have less items, the fellow applicant who helps you fill out a form you find really challenging or the stranger who notices your tears in public and gently asks you what's wrong. People are good; it's just easy to forget.\n\n\nThen there are the occasions of incredible heroism, like when someone cuts you from a car wreck, dives in and rescues your drowning child or runs into your burning house and pulls out your pets. Whether the actions are small or grand, notice what others do and celebrate the milk of human kindness. Untold kindnesses happen every day that could be termed \"people just doing their job\" or truly be seen for the caring and connecting behaviors that they are.",

Reading about how other people find gratitude in everyday things can inspire you to feel more hopeful generally and to see that many, many people genuinely care for the beauty and awe of this world and its beings.\n\n\nThese are just a few common examples. Type \"gratitude journals\" or \"good news stories\" into Google to be bombarded with the wonderful things happening across our planet on the daily.",
            "Keep a list of people who inspire you. Make a bookmark on your usual browser and start stockpiling people who inspire you through their actions. Check back regularly for updates they're making as they progress in their endeavors. And add people who are no longer with us too – past endeavors are just as valuable for they enabled human society to be as advanced as it is today.\n\n\nMahatma Gandhi summed it up well when he implored that: “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.” While cruel and nasty things do happen each day, so do many acts of kindness and joy.",
            "Encourage faith in your fellow humans through your actions. Try seeing the world in a more trusting, less demanding way. Implement Gandhi's famous line to \"be the change you wish to see in the world.\" When you model the kind of change you want to see spread, you spark virtuous ripples that, even if they don't obviously benefit you personally move forth to benefit others, thereby continuously improving the community of which you are a part. Ultimately, faith in humanity isn't predicated on what you get back – it's about knowing that you're making life a little better, a little easier and a little more livable for everyone you connect with.\n\nTrust more in others. For example, you may take a person at his or her word that he will pay you for a used item he or she has purchased off you. You might loan a neighbor or friend your tools or DVD series without specifying a return date, having faith that the things will return when they need to. Perhaps you have worried in the past as to where your charity donation ends up, or you're concerned that the homeless person will run off and buy beer rather than a place to rest his or her head for the night, causing you to not donate anything at all. Instead of imposing your will, just give. Have faith that that donation will do what it needs to do.\nSometimes people will do the wrong thing by you, but on the whole, it's much more likely that you'll be surprised by how people repay your faith in them positively, returning trust with trust – and gratitude. Implementing this extent of faith in others can be very scary at first, especially if you've been very attached to things/money but when you've reached this stage, you will have traveled far in restoring your faith in humanity.",
            "Practice random acts of kindness. Try topping off your neighboring driver's parking meter when you see it's nearly empty, shouting a stranger an extra coffee while standing in line or wiping down the public shower at the pool after you've used it instead of leaving it all muddy. For more ideas, see How to Practice Random Acts of Kindness.\n\n\n\nPay it forward. Instead of asking that your good deed be repaid in any way, ask that the return favor be \"paid forward\" to someone else in need. For example, perhaps you can afford to help a student attend a course that he or she would otherwise be unable to afford. In turn, ask that student to do likewise in the future for another student he or she comes across unable to afford a course.",
            "Be compassionate. While the inner goodness of every single human being you come across may not be evident all of the time, it is compassion that allows you to dig underneath the surface of the woes, injuries and ills of your fellow human beings. By looking deeper, you'll often discover what motivates or compels unkind, ruthless or thoughtless behavior. It is in the seeking to understand better why people behave as they do that you can empathize with them and learn tolerance. It is in forgiving people for their lesser self behavior that you learn to stop hurting and give them the gift of freedom to heal themselves from pain and fear and to become the best they can be.\n\n\nFind as many ways as possible to collaborate and cooperate with your fellow humans. Reduce conflict and competition by encouraging and facilitating collaborative ways to get things done – at work, at home, in your school or college, in the local park, wherever you may be.\nMake room for others, even though you don't know them. When the traffic is thick or the queue is long, let others in. They are human too, they feel as you do, and what a delightful shock to learn that someone else cares about them. Your thoughtfulness will reverberate as many of those you let in will feel the need to let someone else in some other time. And on it goes.",
            "Tell stories of human goodness to other people you know, in order to inspire them to see the good in humanity too. Once you've cottoned on to finding positive stories about humanity, share your experience with others to help inspire their positive actions and thoughts. If you have your own blog or you update a social network stream with stories, share more stories that are positive and uplifting. What can you do right now, today, to pass on the stories that show people's goodwill, their acts of heroism and human virtues?\n\n\nCelebrate those awe-inspiring moments when people do something incredible, such as forgoing a race win to help an injured fellow athlete, rescuing a pet caught in a burning home, shaking hands with an enemy during a détente in hostilities, etc. By celebrating and sharing the stories, images and creative works that spring up around heroic and altruistic acts of human care and love, you become a part of spreading the power and worthiness of decent, kind and caring actions.",
            "Restore your faith in yourself. Remember that you too form part of humanity. Your preferred world won't come about by distancing yourself from your fellow humans or by constantly deploring them.If you feel that most of humanity is doomed or facile, perhaps the problem lies within. Henry Miller once said, \"The man who is forever disturbed about the condition of humanity either has no problems of his own or has refused to face them.\" If you've had a hard life, stop being hard on yourself. Learn to forgive yourself and believe in yourself more. Step out of your comfort zone to learn new things and to push yourself to do things that you're worried you might fail at. Be bold––the world deserves your talents.\n\n\nIf you prefer despair over hope or complaining over action, then you will find negativity wherever you look. On the other hand, you can choose to have faith in humanity, in many of the ways described above. Moreover, you can choose to be kind as a form of taking a stand against the injustices, violence, wastage and hunger in the world.\nYou may feel powerless in the face of what seems terrible at times but you are not. Kindness is quiet, unobtrusive empowerment of every individual; by being kind, you affirm the kind of world you want to be a part of."

Though you may not understand the other person's decisions, you can try to accept them.",
            "Remind yourself of your own value. If it helps, use daily affirmations, or post reminders in areas you're likely to see them. Just because you've been in love with the wrong person, or have been frustrated because it's the wrong time to develop a relationship, doesn't mean that you don't have value. Remember, your life is made up of a series of experiences and encounters, not just this one.[6]\n\nYou are exactly the right person at the right time, for someone else.\nYou may find that you're able to use this experience in rejection as a lesson in finding the right person for you.",
            "Quit feeling sorry for yourself. When you’re in love with the wrong person, it’s easy to feel sorry for yourself. It’s a sad situation, and feelings of self-pity can provide a temporary solace. The first step is to decide that you’re going to implement a zero tolerance policy towards self-pity in your life.[7]\n\nIf you notice feelings of self-pity creeping in, remind yourself of something that you feel good about.\nYou’ll probably slip into self-pity as you try to quit, because of ingrained patterns of thinking. Don’t get angry at yourself; just notice when this happens, and turn your attention to something more positive.\nWhen you start to realize that self-pity isn’t a solution to your problem, you’re ready to try new things.",
            "Keep a gratitude journal. Forcing yourself to pay attention to the good things in your life which you might otherwise take for granted will help you counter your feelings of sadness. The best practices in keeping a gratitude journal include writing in detail about particular people you’re grateful for, and recording events which were surprising or unexpected.[8]\n\nWrite without worrying about the quality of your writing in a gratitude journal. You can write in complete sentences, or you can just jot down a couple of words, ideas, or images.\nWhen you’re feeling overwhelmed by negative feelings, writing a list of things that you’re grateful for can help turn your attention to more positive things.\nYou can read through your gratitude journal to give yourself a boost any time. After all, no matter how hard your life might feel at the moment, there are always things to be happy about.",
            "Consider talking to a professional. A therapist, counselor, rabbi, minister or another professional will have had experience in helping people cope with unhappy experiences of love. It can be helpful to talk to someone who doesn’t have a personal investment in the situation, who can talk to you without being concerned about taking sides. Self-pity can be due to a long history of bad relationships, starting from childhood. You may need to work through these issues to start improving your relationships. You should not attempt to do this on your own. Seek help from a mental health professional who can guide you through this process.[9]\n\nYou may want to check with the therapist to see if examining your past relationships is something that he or she can help you to do. Some therapists prefer to focus on the present rather than digging up problems from your past.\nKeep in mind that this process can be quite painful and it will take time to complete.\nYou can trust a professional not to share your personal information with others.\nSeeing a professional can be expensive, but often insurance coverage can help defray the costs. There are also clinics which offer counseling services for free or lower-cost for low income people.",
            "Learn to love yourself. When you've been involved in an unhappy love situation, you might conclude that no one wants you. However, this is a result of rejection and/or being in a bad relationship. Instead, take this opportunity to remind yourself of your positive qualities.[10]\n\nPracticing self-love will aid the healing process of a broken heart, as it affirms your self-worth and self-esteem.\nIf you find yourself engaging in negative self-talk, check yourself. Are these words that you would say to a loved one? If not, consider what you might say to someone whom you loved.",
            "Talk to someone you trust. There are lots of good reasons to share your feelings with another person. Talking about your frustration will help you see your relationship in a new way, which may offer solutions you hadn’t thought about before.[11]\n\nTalking with a trusted friend is a great way to release pent-up feelings, and will help you feel better.\nYou’ll likely find out that your friend has had similar experiences, which will help if you’re feeling alone.",
            "Start to build your self-esteem. Low self-esteem is an unrealistically negative evaluation of yourself. People with low self-esteem are more likely to find themselves in unhappy love situations. As you develop your ability to care about yourself, you’ll be less likely to feel sorry for yourself.[12]\n\nPerhaps this is a good time to try new activities, join self-help groups, or volunteer to help someone less fortunate than yourself.\nPaying attention to your own feelings can help you develop self-esteem. When you don’t respect your own feelings, you’re left to believe whatever other people tell you you should feel.",
            "Get active. Moving your body is an excellent way to stop feeling sorry for yourself. When you force yourself to exercise and get your heart pumping, you’ll start to feel better about yourself. The endorphins that come from exercise will kick in, elevating your mood.[13]\n\nRemember the old expression, “Move a muscle, change a thought.”\nExercise helps everything about your life: you’ll sleep better, you’ll become healthier and more fit, and you’ll feel less stressed.",
            "Practice kindness to yourself. When you notice your internal dialogue (or self-talk) repeating negativity, find a way to see things in a new light. For example, if you find yourself telling yourself, “You’re so stupid!” remind yourself that, “That’s okay, it was just a little mistake.” If it was a big mistake, remind yourself that you’ll learn from the experience. You can say, “It’s human to make mistakes. I love myself anyway, and I don’t have to be perfect.”[14]\n\nBeing understanding towards yourself when you make a mistake will help you heal as you cope with unreturned feelings of love.\nWhen you’re in love with the wrong person, it’s especially important to practice kindness to yourself.",
            "Live intentionally. This means prioritizing what you want, feel and think. People who fall in love with the wrong person often have spent more time relying on what other people want for them, rather than on what they want for themselves. If you’re trying to cope with an unhappy experience of love, restore your balance by paying attention to yourself.[15]\n\nConsider what really makes you feel happy. When do you feel most “like yourself”? Do more of these things.[16]\n\nWhen you find yourself doing things that make you feel awkward, silly, or unimportant, it’s okay to try to minimize these things in your life.",

            "Look for patterns in your love life. If you feel insecure in relationships or don’t like to get too close to people, chances are you’ve been in multiple unhappy love situations. A good friend or a therapist can be a great resource in identifying patterns that cause you to seek out bad relationships.[18]\n\nTry reading up on attachment issues to see if you’re able to identify your own experiences.\nSeeing your behavior as a series of patterns, rather than moral failures, can help provide a nonjudgmental lens.[19]",

Fears about being single can skew your priorities, allowing you to get in (and stay in!) unsatisfying relationships.[20]\n\nPeople who are in bad relationships are just as lonely as people who are afraid of being single.\nIf you’re afraid of being single, you’re more likely to miss warning signs that would keep you from being in a bad relationship.",
            "Protect yourself. Make sure you’re practicing discernment when you choose who to let into your life. If you notice friends who appear to take pleasure in your discomfort or misfortune, you might want to consider keeping them out of your life.[21]\n\nCultivate friendships that help you feel nourished and protected. Your friends should be happy when things are going well for you.\nWhen you’re surrounded by people who love and respect you, you’re more likely to be able to love and respect yourself.",

Being less hard on yourself may take some practice, but ultimately learning to forgive yourself will lead you to a more resilient life.[22]\n\nMistakes are only mistakes, and opportunities abound to learn from them. Consider mistakes lessons that you needed to learn.\nWithout pain, there’s little chance of growing and learning new things. Mistakes, even painful ones, are just a part of learning."

    "wikiHow to Eavesdrop": {
        "intro": "We eavesdrop for many reasons. Sometimes we eavesdrop to find out information, to entertain ourselves, or to develop our imagination or writing skills. Eavesdropping, in a sense, is an art form,[1] and collecting fragments of conversations not only teaches us about people but also about human communication and connection.",
        "steps": [
            "Hover around closed doors. Maybe you want to know how mad your parents really are about your D in Chemistry, or what your son is saying to his friend on the phone, or what your roommate really thinks about you. Sneak quietly to the door and listen.\n\n\nIf someone walks by and sees you, don’t act suspicious. Instead of running off in a hurry, seem like you have a reason to be there, such as picking up something you just happened to drop outside of the door.\nIf one of the people you are eavesdropping on comes out of the door, you could pretend you were about to knock and say something like, “Oh, I was just coming to find you. I needed to ask you a question.” Then come up quickly with a question to ask!",
            "Listen through the keyhole. You may be able to hear more if you crouch down and put your ear to the door. It would be a good idea to drop something very obvious on the floor (such as a pile of papers) so that if anyone comes by they will just think you are kneeling on the floor to pick up what you have dropped.",
            "Use a thin glass. If you are trying to hear through a wall, you can use a thin drinking glass to amplify the sound.[2] Place the rim of the glass to the wall and position your ear on the other end.\n\n\nIt’s best to use this method in a place where you won’t be seen, such as your bedroom. You will have a harder time pretending not to be eavesdropping if someone sees you listening through a drinking glass!",
            "Sit quietly in the next room. You can position yourself in a good location to eavesdrop after a conversation you want to hear has already begun. Just be quiet about it, and be sure to pretend to have a good reason to be there.\n\n\nFor instance, maybe your competition at work has a meeting with the boss, and the boss’s office is next to the supply closet. Pretend you desperately need some paperclips. In fact, you seem to be out of everything at the moment so you need to spend a while stocking up—long enough, at least, to eavesdrop just a tiny bit.\nIf you’re at home, your parents might be having a discussion in the kitchen that you want to overhear. Go into the living room (or whichever room is near the kitchen) and sit quietly, but have an excuse ready if they ask you what you are doing. Maybe you left something in the living room and you need to look under all the couch cushions… repeatedly.",
            "Crack the window. You can catch a conversation going on outside your room by opening your window. Don’t be too obvious, though. Instead of opening the window all the way, just slowly open it an inch or two. Sit down with your ear near the window so that the people you are eavesdropping on don’t see you.\n\n\nYou could also listen to a conversation happening inside your house from the outside via an open window, but you’ll have to do some pre-planning. In this instance, you should crack the window prior to the conversation you want to overhear and position yourself outside. Crouch down by the window on the outside of the house so no one inside sees you.",
            "Eliminate other sounds. Wherever you are trying to eavesdrop, it’s important to cancel out any noise other than the conversation you are trying to overhear.\n\n\nIn addition to turning off the T.V. and stereo or MP3 player, be sure to turn off overhead fans and any devices, such as a computer or printer, that make less obvious noises. Even small sounds can interfere with your attempt to overhear!",
            "Plant a recording device. You can use a small digital recorder if you have one, or a recording app on your phone. Be sure to place it in an inconspicuous place that is still in a close proximity to the people you want to record.\n\n\nBe aware, however, that recording conversations in order to eavesdrop is illegal in some places and punishable by law.[3]",

A small device such as the Next Room Eavesdropping Device allows you to amplify conversations through walls and listen through headphones.[4]",
            "Pick up the other line. Very few people have a home telephone now, but if you do live in a house that hasn’t yet gone “cell-phone-only,” you can pick up another line and listen to the conversation. Make sure you don’t breathe too hard or giggle, though!",
            "Employ social media. Eavesdropping doesn’t always have to be done in person. You can of course check out conversations on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to find out who is talking to whom and what they are saying.",
            "Feign absorption. Maybe you are at home, school, or work and plan to eavesdrop on a family member, schoolmate, or coworker. Maybe you’re even in the same room (or the next cubicle). Your main goal should be to look extremely absorbed in whatever you are doing so that the person you want to eavesdrop on won’t be suspicious. They might even forget you are even there!\n\n\nIf you are at work, look intently at your computer screen while frantically typing. You might be typing gibberish, but the person in the next cubicle will just think you are concentrating on your work (and not his or her conversation).\nAt home or school, put on your headphones and grab a book or magazine. Look completely disinterested in what is going on in the room; be surprised that other people are even there. The look on your face, if approached or “interrupted” from your magazine and music, should say: “Wow, I didn’t even realize you were in here having this private conversation !”",
            "Bring a prop. If you have a prop, people will be less likely to think you are paying attention to them. Grab a book, your phone, or your MP3 player. You should look like you are doing something other than listening in on people’s conversations, so pretend to read, scroll through your phone, or listen to music.\n\n\nBe sure your prop is one that helps you blend in, not stand out! You don’t want people to notice you at all",
            "Find a good position. In shared, public spaces, the busier the place, the better. Sit down on a bench or in the middle of park where people are hanging out or walking by.\n\n\nAlternately, walk around and listen closely for a good conversation. If you hear a snippet of a conversation that interests you, sit down close (but not too close) to the people you want to eavesdrop on. Pretend to be interested in your book, phone, or music.",
            "Get out and about. If you enjoy eavesdropping as a leisure activity, taking public transport, eating out alone, browsing a store, and hanging out at a coffee shop will put you in a good position to overhear some interesting conversations.\n\n\nInstead of driving yourself to work or around town for your weekend errands, take the bus or the subway. You may have better luck on weekends or evenings when people are headed out on the town, since people who commute to work are usually solo travelers and aren’t generally engaged in conversations.\nWhen eating out alone, try to sit near a large party—the more boisterous, the better. If the hostess sits you at a table away from other groups, ask politely if you could have a different table—perhaps a high top near the restaurant’s bar, if a lot of people are hanging out there.\nWhile shopping, don’t just make a bee-line for the items on your list. Instead, wander the aisles of the supermarket, convenience store, or neighborhood shop. Pick up items and look at them; walk slowly and listen for conversations on the aisles close to you.\nGrab something to drink on the weekend at a coffee shop and stick around for a while. You could do this during the week, too, but weekends are better because people are out and about with friends (rather than scrambling to get work done on their lunch break during the week)."

    "wikiHow to Grow Lisianthus": {
        "intro": "The first thing lisianthus plants are known for are their beautiful bell-shaped flowers. Unfortunately, the second thing lisianthus plants are known for is being notoriously difficult to cultivate. For best results, grow the plant from plugs—small seedlings that are well-developed in their growth and purchased in disposable plastic trays—instead of attempting to cultivate them from seed. Due to how finicky this flower is, you may have an easier time caring for lisianthus plants if you grow them in containers rather than your garden.",
        "steps": [
            "Choose root-bound plugs. In order to transplant a plug cleanly into a new location, the plant should be well held together by its own roots. Otherwise, the transplanting process could get messy and may end up damaging the sensitive plant.",
            "Select an appropriately sized container. The best size will depend on the variety you choose.[1]\n\nFlorida lisianthus and forever lisianthus need a pot that is 4 to 6 in. (10 to 15 cm) deep.\nLisa lisianthus need a pot that is 3 to 6 in. (7 to 15 cm) deep.\nSapphire lisianthus need a pot that is 3 to 4 in. (7 to 10 cm) deep.",
            "Make sure your container has drainage holes. Lisianthus roots can rot if allowed to sit in excess water, so good drainage is important. If the container you chose does not have holes in the bottom, drill one or two holes into the bottom using a power drill.",
            "Fill the pot with a loose potting mix. A commercially available potting mix should be fine, and both soil and soilless mixes can work.",
            "Test the pH of the soil. These plants demand a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.0m and serious problems can arise if the pH dips below 6.5. If your potting medium has a low pH, mix in some limestone to bring the pH back up.",
            "Dig a hole that is as deep as the plug. Center the hole in the middle of the pot.",
            "Remove the plug. Gently squeeze on the sides of the plastic to loosen the plant from the plug container. You should be able to remove the plant, soil and all, without any breakage.",
            "Place the plug plant inside the hole. Pack the soil in the pot around the lisianthus plant to keep the new seedling in place.",
            "Place the pot onto a saucer. A saucer prevents excess water and soil from spilling out onto your counter or windowsill.",
            "Continue to monitor the pH of the soil. The soil should always be at a pH between 6.5 and 7.2, and if it dips below this range, you should remedy the problem by mixing in a little limestone.",
            "Keep the plant warm, but not too warm. Optimal daytime temperature is between 68 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 24 degrees Celsius). Optimal nighttime temperature is between 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius).",
            "Place the pot in partial sun. These plants need plenty of sunlight for flower buds to form, but too much sun will cause the temperature to rise too high and could damage the foliage.\n\n\nPlace the plant in a sunny window and allow it to get as much direct sun as possible before it flowers.\nOn cloudy days, you may need to supplement natural light by placing the pot beneath fluorescent or HID grow lights for 8 to 12 hours. This is especially true if the plant has not yet flowered.\nAfter the plant flowers, move it to a slightly shady area to protect the petals. Keeping it near a window where it can receive indirect or filtered sunlight should work.",
            "Keep the soil moist. Water it every few days, allowing the soil to dry out in between waterings. Use your finger to gauge the dryness of the soil at a depth of 2 in. (5 cm). Once it is dry this deep, give the plant a light sprinkling of water using a watering can, but do not soak it.\n\n\nAvoid letting the soil dry out once the plants are in soil. As soon as the surface of the soil looks dry, sprinkle it with water.",
            "Feed your lisianthus plant with a fertilizer high in potassium. Potassium generally improves the flower and overall strength of the plant. The fertilizer should also be fairly high in nitrogen to promote healthy foliage growth. Avoid fertilizers that are too heavy in phosphorus, however. Look for formulas such as 15-0-15 or 20-10-20, where the numbers correspond to the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer, respectively.\n\n\nAdd the fertilizer once every two weeks before the plant flowers. After the plant flowers, reduce feedings to once every three or four weeks.\nFertilizers rich in calcium are also good for a lisianthus plant.",
            "Use growth regulator. Lisianthus plants that grow too tall can end up depriving themselves of valuable nutrients, leading to less flowering and earlier death. Apply a b-Nine spray two weeks after transplanting the plug into its pot. Avoid applying it too frequently afterward, since excess growth regulator can also lead to a decrease in flower production.",
            "Watch out for fungus gnats and other pests. Fungus gnats are the most common threat to lisianthus flowers, and they can cause a lot of damage to the roots of the plant. Aphids, leaf miners, thrips, and whiteflies are also big problem pests. If you spot any of these pests on your plant, treat the infested area with a mild pesticide.\n\n\nYou may also want to consider applying a mild pesticide to your plant preemptively, before any pests show up.",
            "Watch out for fungal diseases. Gray mold, stem rot, and pythium root rot are among the most frequent diseases contracted. Proper drainage should prevent most of these fungi from attacking your plant, but if your lisianthus does get a fungus, treat it with a fungicide."

    "wikiHow to Choose a Loyal Partner": {
        "intro": "Perhaps one of the most valuable assets you can have in a romantic relationship is loyalty. You may be struggling to find a partner who is loyal and reliable, especially when confronted with a difficult situation or a tricky relationship issue. Or you may already be with someone but are unsure if they are loyal and have what it takes to be your life partner. You can choose a partner who is loyal by looking at how they behave. You should also consider how you interact together as a couple and watch for any red flags that indicate the person is not as loyal as they could be.",
        "steps": [
            "Notice if the person is reliable and honest. You should consider the individual traits of your partner or a person who may be a partner to you in the future. One of the key traits you should look for is reliability and honesty. Ask yourself, “Does this person appear reliable and honest?” and “How does this person demonstrate they are reliable and honest?”[1]\n\nFor example, you may notice that the person shows up when they say they are going to and does not flake out at the last minute on plans you have together.\nYou may also notice that the person does not cheat on tests or exams, even though they might get away with it. This is an indication that they have a strong moral compass and will not simply take the easy route if it means less work for them.",
            "Consider if the person is supportive of you. A loyal partner will honor your individual traits and skills. You should note if the person shows clear support for your interests and goals. Having a partner who is supportive also shows that they are interested in you as a person and care about your future.[2]\n\nFor example, you may notice that the person always shows up to your games or matches, or makes every effort to be there. Maybe the person takes on extra duties at home so you have time to study for an exam or time to spend on an important project for work.\nYou may also note that the person tells you directly, “I support you and think what you are doing is great,” or, “I believe in you and your abilities. I want to support you in every way I can.”",
            "Determine if the person is emotionally mature. Emotional maturity is a key trait in a relationship, as it indicates that the person is comfortable in their own skin and willing to be there for you emotionally. Being emotionally mature is a good indicator of loyalty and a good sign that your relationship is healthy.[3]\n\nFor example, an emotionally mature person will be a good listener and put their needs aside to focus on your needs. They will also be comfortable talking about their feelings, wants, and needs with you and be willing to ask for what they want.\nAn emotionally mature person will also be able to make their own decisions and choices without the influence of others. This is a good trait to have as it shows that they can be accountable for their own choices and be responsible with their decisions.",
            "Determine what \"loyalty\" means to you. Take some time to think about what loyalty looks like to you; look at the obvious things as well as more subtle situations. Does loyalty mean not cheating (emotionally/ physically/both)? Not talking about private matters with others? Showing up to company events? Collaborating on financial decisions prior to purchases? Checking in before committing to plans? What exactly are you expecting from a partner when you use the term \"loyal\"? You need to have a clear idea of what these behaviors are in order to look for them in others and have a conversation about them.",
            "Talk to your partner about what is important to you. Instead assuming your definition of loyalty matches your partner's, have a discussion about which behaviors indicate loyalty to you. For instance, your partner showing up to your soccer match may be a demonstration of loyalty in your eyes. But maybe your partner doesn't mind if you don't go to their events, so they don't realize how important it is to you that they go to your events. Take the time to express which behaviors are important and which meet your needs for a relationship, and allow your partner to do the same.",
            "Look at how you handle conflict. When trying to determine if you have chosen a loyal partner, you should consider how you handle conflict in your relationship. Are you both able to talk about any issues or problems you may be having? Can you speak openly about how you feel with your partner? Having good communication skills and listening skills are important aspects of a fulfilling, loyal relationship.[4]\n\nYou may also think about how your partner handles conflict between you. Do they get upset and shut down? Are they able to talk to you about their feelings and concerns? Note how they react in difficult or challenging situations and whether you feel they react in a healthy, honest way.",
            "Consider if you trust each other. You should also take a moment to consider if you can place your complete trust in that person and if they can do the same with you. Ask yourself, “Can I trust in this person completely?” If the answer is “no” or “maybe,” you should consider why you are hesitant to trust your partner. You may write down why you cannot answer “yes” to the question and consider if the reasons for “no” are not fixable or able to addressed with your partner.[5]\n\nFor example, you may write down that you cannot trust your partner because they are not honest with you about their feelings. You may then consider talking with your partner about being more open and honest with their feelings. Communicating with them about your concerns may help you learn how to trust them in the future.",
            "Think about how your relationship has progressed. You should also look at the big picture and consider your relationship as a whole. Think about where your relationship started and where it is at now. Does it feel like you and your partner have grown and matured together? Does your relationship feel stronger now than it did in the past? If your relationship is healthy, your sense of loyalty for your partner should expand over time and you should feel you can trust them after so much time together.[6]\n\nIf you feel your relationship has not developed as much as you hoped it would in terms of trust and loyalty, you may decide to talk to your partner about how you are feeling. You should consider what you can both do to prioritize your relationship and develop a stronger sense of loyalty.",
            "Look at how the person treats their friends and family. You can tell a lot about a person’s loyalty based on how they treat those they love and those closest to them. Consider if your partner is loyal and honest with their family and their friends or if they are flaky and unreliable. A loyal person will treat those closest to them with respect, admiration, and consideration. It may be a red flag if your partner is not as supportive or considerate of those closest to them as they could be.[7]\n\nFor example, you should consider if the person treats their friends with loyalty and consideration. Do they try to support their friends in their endeavors? Do they try to spend time with their friends and follow through on their commitments to their friends?\nYou should also consider how your partner treats their family. Though they may not be close to their family, they may still go out of their way to help a family member in need or try to support a family member who is suffering or having a hard time.",
            "Determine if the person follows through on their commitments. You should also consider if the person is able to commit to things and follow through on their word. This is an important indicator of loyal and reliable behavior. You want a partner who is not flaky or unable to commit to anything, as it could be a sign they have a hard time being loyal to those around them.[8]\n\nFor example, you may notice that the person is good at texting people back and responding to messages from friends who are in need. They may also make plans with friends or coworkers and then make sure they always show up and put in an effort.\nYou may also note that the person is able to commit to short-term plans and long-term plans with you. Perhaps you make dinner plans for next week and the person makes sure they can make it. You may also plan a vacation in a few months and note that the person makes sure they are able to go with you before they commit.",
            "Check that the person sets boundaries with others. You should pay attention to how the person interacts with others and ensure they are good at setting boundaries. Having boundaries is an important part of being loyal, as you want a partner who is able to be friendly but not too flirty with others. If the person tends to get too close to friends or coworkers and is not good at saying \"no,\" this may be a red flag.[9]\n\nYour partner should be aware of when they are stepping over the line and possibly breaking your trust by spending too much time with someone else or by devoting too much emotion to another person. If you express concern about their relationship with someone else, they should listen to your concerns and try to show you that you have nothing to worry about.\nFor example, you should note if your partner is able to have relationships with the opposite sex, or the sex they are attracted to, without ending up getting too flirty or too close. This could be someone they work with or a close friend. They should be able to maintain friendly, platonic relationships with others and also devote enough time to your relationship.",

Your partner should try to assure you that they can be loyal to you and show you that they can be loyal. You may also ask them to show you that they can be trusted and will not cheat on you like they did with their other partners in the past."

    "wikiHow to Flirt with a Guy": {
        "intro": "Flirting with a cute guy might seem like an impossible task, but it's easier than you think! You can flirt with a guy from across the room by relying on friendly body language, like a coy smile or a playful hair flip. To flirt with him in person, light touching, playful teasing, and sincere compliments work well. Flirting via text can be done with compliments and invitations to hang out.",
        "steps": [
            "Make eye contact. Eye contact is a key flirting technique which can be implemented anywhere, at any time, as long as your crush is in sight. While you don't want it to look like you're staring deep into his soul, lingering eye contact will show him you're interested.\n\n\nIt will also be a good indicator of his interest—if he holds the eye contact, he's probably into you. If he looks away he might just be shy.\nOne good trick is to look directly at him until he catches you looking. When he does, hold eye contact for a moment or two before smiling and looking away.\nIf you're feeling particularly cheeky, you could throw in a wink!",
            "Smile. Studies have shown that smiling actually makes you more attractive to other people, so work that to your advantage by flashing those pearly whites!\n\n\nSmiling makes you seem friendlier and more approachable, which might be just the push your crush needs to come over and talk to you!\nSmiling will also make you feel happier and more confident two essential ingredients of successful flirting.",
            "Use body language. Even if you haven't opened your mouth, you can say a great deal using just your body language. Smiling and eye contact are part of this, but there are a few other things you should be aware of:\n\n\nDon't cross your arms. Crossing your arms is like the opposite of smiling - it makes you seem closed off and unapproachable, thus scaring your man away. Some people do this unconsciously when they're nervous, so make sure to keep an eye on it.\nFlip your hair. Flipping your hair is a very feminine action, as it draws attention to your lustrous locks. It is also a well-recognized flirty action - so if you flip or play with your hair in front of a guy, he'll probably know you're flirting with him.\nPlay with your jewelry. Playing with jewelry, such as a necklace, draws attention to your neckline, which many guys find attractive in a girl.",
            "Find subtle ways to put yourself in his path. In order to flirt, you need to be around the object of your affection as often as possible. Make a conscious effort to put yourself in his path, without seeming too obvious.\n\n\nWalk past his desk on your way out the door, or take your dog to the same park he plays soccer at.\nBe careful not to overdo this, though, or you'll end up looking like a stalker.",
            "Look your best. Give yourself an added boost of confidence by looking your very best whenever your crush is around. This doesn't mean tiny skirts, high heels and lashings of mascara - it just means that you should take some pride in your appearance by being well-groomed and neatly dressed. If you look your best, you'll feel your best - which is essential for successful flirting!\n\n\nKeep your hair clean and fresh-smelling, brush your teeth, shave where necessary, paint your nails - anything that makes you feel pretty and puts an extra pep in your step.\nWear clean, non-wrinkled clothes that you feel comfortable in - you can't go wrong with a nice fitting pair of jeans!\nTry out different hairstyles - curly, straight, in a bun, in a fishtail braid - to create a fresh new look each day. The same goes for make-up - experiment with different colors and trends til you find a look that makes you feel good.",
            "Consider making the first move. Sure, you could wait for him to come to you. But there's a lot of expectation on guys to start the pursuit, and it can get tiring. If you approach him, you'll instantly stand out among all the other girls he might consider dating — and you get to pick the perfect moment for you.",
            "Start talking. One of the best ways to move the situation along and flirt more openly is to get involved in a conversation with your crush. Find an opportunity to chat him up about something you have in common, whether it's school, work, or a recent event.\n\n\nOpen with a question. This will show you're interested in getting to know him, not just interested in talking about yourself. Ask him what he thought of the latest Fast and Furious installment or whether he did anything fun over the weekend.\nTry to avoid asking questions that can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" - this is a surefire way to end the conversation before it's even begun.\nTransition to talking about him. People love to talk about themselves, so try to get him started on something he's passionate about - whether it's music, sport or plans for the future.\nUse his name a lot. It's a fact that people love to hear their own name in conversation - especially when it's used by a member of the opposite sex! Calling your crush by his name will send a tingle up his spine and create a sense of intimacy between you.",
            "Smile and laugh. Smiling and laughing throughout your conversation shows that you're comfortable around your crush and, more than that, that you enjoy listening to him talk.\n\n\nIt will also make you look more attractive and you will come across as a happy, fun-loving person - which is exactly how you want him to view you.\nLaughing at his jokes will make him feel funny, which guys always like. Be careful not to overdo it though - you don't want to sound like a cackling hyena and scare him away!",
            "Break the touch barrier. Finding small ways to touch your crush is an obvious signal that you're flirting, and shows him that you're willing to make a small level of physical contact. Try doing it in these ways:\n\n\nTouch his forearm lightly while you're talking. When he makes a funny joke, reach your hand out and touch his arm while you're laughing. Alternatively, you can do this as a form of playful or genuine consolation.\nCasually put a hand or elbow on his shoulder. This creates a sense of camaraderie between you and shows him that you feel completely comfortable around him.\n\"Accidentally\" lean into him if you're walking together. If you're already flirty and you want to move things to the next level, brush your hand against his and see how he reacts.\nStraighten his collar. Another sneaky tactic you can use to touch your crush is to tell him that his shirt collar (or tie) is crooked, so you can lean in to fix it. Stand squarely in front of him so you're face to face, then casually brush your fingers against his neck as you adjust his collar. When you're done, look him in the eyes and say \"that's better!\" before taking a step back.",
            "Draw attention to your body. Guys are visual creatures, so nothing gets them going like a sneaky flash of flesh here and there. Subtly drawing attention to your body every now and then will get his heart racing and help him to realize how much he likes you.\n\n\nRub your shoulder. Pretend you have an ache in your shoulder and pull down the neckline of your top, exposing your skin as you massage it. If you're lucky, he'll offer to rub it better for you.\nAsk if you should get your belly button pierced. For tummy-confident girls, one good technique is to pull up your top slightly and tell him you were thinking of getting your belly button pierced, then ask for his opinion on the matter. If he stammers out an answer, you'll know your cheeky trick caught his attention.\nLick your lips. Make him think about kissing you by drawing attention to your lips in front of him. Lick your lips, bite them, apply some lip gloss - anything as long as you do it with an air of nonchalance.\nBe careful not to overdo things here - drawing attention to your body can work very well, but only if it's used in moderation. Otherwise you can seem desperate and attention-seeking, so avoid prancing around in front of him in a bikini (unless you're at the beach - in which case; go for it!)",
            "Dance with him. Dancing with a guy is a fun way to show him that you're into him, without being too serious. It could be at a school dance or a nightclub, it doesn't matter as long as you get some one-on-one time together.\n\n\nMake it very obvious that you're choosing to dance with him. Grab his hands and pull him away from the group. If he goes with you willingly, you'll know that he's into it.\nYou can try to dance sexily if you like, but avoid grinding on him or being too overtly sexual - it's inappropriate in front of other people and you might just make him feel uncomfortable.\nIf he's an awkward dancer, you can try to make him feel more at ease by breaking out some wacky dance moves of your own - just be silly and have fun with it - if you can make him laugh, then it's worth it.\nTry to work in a slow dance if you can. Put your arms on his shoulders and let him hold you tightly around the waist. Gaze up into his eyes as you gently sway - he'll melt inside.",
            "Pay him a compliment. Don't expect the compliments to go one-way — guys love to be complimented too! Making your crush feel noticed and appreciated shows him that you're interested in him as a person, and that you're paying attention to what's important. Here's how to make your compliment even more amazing:\n\n\nBe specific. The more specific you are, the more personal the compliment will be. If you say something generic such as \"I think you're hot,\" chances will be that he's heard it before. If you focus on a specific trait or quality that you love, the compliment will be fresh and you'll stick out in his mind.\nIf he's on a sports team and you saw him play, praise his performance. If you heard him playing his guitar or drums, compliment his playing. If you're feeling more intimate, tell him that you love the color of his eyes - and use it as an excuse to gaze into them.\nWhen giving the compliment, lean in close and lower your voice slightly. This makes the compliment seem intimate and secret.\nMake eye contact while you give the compliment and keep smiling slightly. This will highlight your sincerity and show him that you're genuinely impressed.\nJust make sure not to overdo it on the compliments or make them too fake. This will significantly lessen their impact and he might stop taking you seriously. One simple, sincere compliment is better than 100 fake ones.",
            "Playfully tease him. Some playful teasing can be a great flirting technique - if used correctly. Teasing can create a sense of intimacy and show the guy that you have a sense of humor. Just be warned - if you give it, you need to be able to take it!\n\n\nTease him about small, unimportant things - pretend you think he has a crush on his Math teacher, or joke that he loves his dog more than any human being.\nIf he's particularly good looking, ask him how his Abercrombie interview went; if he's just been to the gym, make an exaggerated comment about his huge muscles - rather than being offensive, you want your teasing to be more of a veiled compliment!\nNever get too personal with your teasing, or he might take it the wrong way - insulting his family, his performance at work or school, or criticizing his appearance should be off-limits - at least until you know him better.",
            "Leave him wanting more. Don't let the conversation drag on so long that he has time to get bored or distracted. Instead, walk away while he's still interested so that he can't wait to see you again.\n\n\nLeave an opening for next time. If you say, \"I have to run, but maybe I'll see you around tomorrow?\", you've already planted the idea that you'll see him again.\nLean in like you want a kiss, but at the last minute turn your head and whisper \"I had a great time\" in his ear.",
            "Text him \"accidentally\". If you're not sure how to get a text conversation going, one good tactic is to text him pretending you think he's someone else, like you're best friend.\n\n\nSay something like \"Haha, yeah right! So what are you doing this weekend?:)\"\nGive it a minute or two, then send a second message saying something like \"Oops, wrong person, sorry! But what are you doing this weekend? ;)\"\nThis will make it seem like you didn't intentionally start a conversation, but you're happy to have one anyway.",
            "Don't be boring. Boring text messages are pointless - texting things like \"what's up?\" or \"what's the weather forecast for tomorrow?\" is deeply uninteresting and won't get you very far with your crush. Try to be unique and interesting - only send a message if you think it's going to bring a smile to your crush's face.\n\n\nFor example, text something like \"Just saw a giant teddy bear in the window of a toy shop - made me think of you.\" or \"Quickly - help me choose: doughnut or chocolate muffin?\"",
            "Leave some questions hanging. Once you're in a text conversation, try not to be overly enthusiastic, responding to every single thing in his last message. These kinds of text messages can be confusing and make you seem too eager.\n\n\nRespond to one or two items per message, but try to leave some of his questions hanging. This will give you an air of mystery and make him want to know the answer even more.\nOn the same note, don't bombard him with questions in every message - this will also make you seem over-eager and he might find responding more hassle than it's worth. Keep your messages short and sweet.",
            "Be suggestive. Once things really get going and you feel more comfortable with your texting, you can start to heat things up a little - dropping not-so-subtle hints that you're interested in being more than friends.\n\n\nPlay it safe at first - there's no need to be too racy, you just need to give him the idea that you want to be with him. Something cute like \"I'm just about to watch a scary movie - wish you were here to stop me from being too scared!\"\nIf he responds in the same flirty tone, you can feel safe to continue. Try paying him a flirty compliment by saying something like \"I can't stop thinking about how great your arms looked in that shirt today.\"\nIf you want to get a little racier, you could try being even more suggestive. For instance, if he texts you but you don't reply for at least half an hour you could say something like \"Sorry, I was in the shower...\" His mind will do the rest.",
            "Don't send more than two texts in a row without a reply. The rules of texting dictate that you should receive approximately the same number of texts as you send. This means that if you're sending your crush 20 messages a day and he's only responding to about 5 of them, you're seriously overdoing it.\n\n\nTry to exercise a little self-control and refrain from texting every time your crush pops into your head. Wait until you have something truly interesting and important to say. And if you send more than two texts without receiving a reply, cut yourself off.\nYou should also avoid always being the first one to text. Be a little mysterious and aloof and wait for him to text you. If he does, you'll know he's interested.\nNever send messages that only contain answers like \"k\" or \"lol\". This can be extremely frustrating and will give your crush nothing to respond to.",
            "Picture text. Picture texting can be a fun alternative way to communicate - and also ensures that your crush has a picture of you on his phone.\n\n\nText him a picture of you and a group of friends at the back or mall and add \"wanna join?\"\nText him a picture of yourself lying on the couch and write \"Bored. Entertain me?\"\nText him a picture of a movie poster or concert flyer and just write \"Interested?\"",
            "Make a date. Texting can be a great way to ask a guy out, particularly if you're nervous about doing it face to face. Try to keep it casual by saying something like:\n\n\n\"Hey! I just watched the trailer for the new Batman movie, I'm dying to see it. Wanna go this weekend?\" or \"Craving a caramel frappuccino! Meet me after school? Coffee's on me. :)\"\nEven if he says no, you don't need to panic. Over text, it's easy to play it cool. Just say something like \"No problem. Some other time.\" Then leave it up to him whether to continue the conversation or not."

This virus causes upper respiratory infections (URIs) most commonly, but can also cause lower respiratory infections and sometimes pneumonia. Rhinoviruses are most prevalent March through October and have a short incubation period of usually 12-72 hours after exposure to the virus.[1] Natural treatments for a cold take advantage of the idea that your immune system is best situated to kill off rhinoviruses.

Then tilt the baby’s head back slightly and use the soft, rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove nasal secretions.[15]\n\nDon’t squeeze the bulb too much.\nGently suction out the solution by squeezing the bulb, placing the tip slightly into the nostril, and then releasing the bulb.\nAvoid touching the inside of the nostril if you can, though this may be difficult with a squirming baby. Wipe the bulb off on a tissue and discard the tissue. Use a new tissue for each nostril, as you are trying to minimize any contamination and to minimize the spread of an infection. Wash your hands before and after each treatment.[16][17]\n\nRepeat this only two to three times a day. If your baby squirms too much, relax and just try again later. Remember to be very gentle![18] For older children, you can repeat the process four to five times a day"

        "steps": [
            "Set a goal for yourself. Saving your money is a lot easier if you have a particular amount in mind. If you can't decide on a set amount, just save around half of the amount that you earn or are given. For example, if you earn $10 today, put $5 towards your savings.\n\n\nGet a piggy bank or other means of storage. Choose a specific place to put it, a somewhat hidden location. Don’t use your wallet, though. It may look like a decent place to keep money, but due to its easy access and portability, it’s really not. Once you find a place, try to not take the money in and out until you’ve reached your goal.",
            "Make a chart. Once you know what you want to save for, figure out how many weeks it will take you, and create a chart to put on your wall. Write down each week and draw a box next to it. Each time you put money in your piggy bank or wherever, put a sticker next to that week showing how much closer you are to actually getting it.[1]\n\nSetting multiple milestones is a great way to stay motivated when you’re saving. For example, you can check off milestones on a big poster board that you keep in your room when you meet your goal of saving $5, then $10, $15 and so on.[2]",
            "Start the jar or envelope budgeting system. On either envelopes or jars, draw pictures of what you are saving for and drop the amount you decide on every week. You can have one for smaller amounts and one for bigger goals. For instance, the short-term savings could be for a certain video game and the long-term container might be for a trip to Magic Mountain.[3]",
            "Visualize what you are going to do with the money you save. Cut out a picture of an item you would like to buy along with its price from a catalog or magazine. Stick it on the wall in your room or somewhere where you will see it often. This can help greatly in motivating you towards your goal.",
            "Put your money in a place where you won’t be tempted to take it out and spend it. You may actually have to hide it from yourself if you do get tempted easily. Be sure it isn't so difficult, though, that you forget about saving or even where you put the money entirely. A sibling or parent's closet may be a good idea, or you may even have them hide it from you over a period of time. That way you will have to go through them to find money to spend.",
            "Remember that every penny counts. As long as it doesn’t belong to someone else, pick up every little coin you see out there. Remember that no matter how little you spend, it'll make a difference in the long run. It's similar to 100,000 individuals saying that their vote doesn't matter, but together they can make a difference.[4]",
            "Find free things to do. When you hang out with friends, do something that doesn't involve spending money. For example, go to the park or play football. Or, if you’re out and not far from home, instead of buying a can of soda at the store for $1.50, save the money and take the trip to your house to get something to drink.",
            "Spend wisely. From the money you have to spend it each week, figure out a small percentage that you want to put in your savings, at least 5 or 10 percent if possible. You’ll be surprised how fast it grows. It’s better to start out with a smaller amount than to say you’re going to save a big amount and then never do it.",
            "Don’t buy food items with your money unless you plan to. The snack only lasts minutes then it's gone, and so is your money. Start baking at home and make your own treats. It’s a lot cheaper.",
            "Tell someone that you are saving your money. This is called “accountability.” It basically means that someone else knows what you’re doing. In terms of savings, it’s so they can keep you from spending it if you feel tempted. Make sure it’s not someone who will encourage you to take it out down the road, though.\n\n\nPerhaps whoever you tell can both save money towards a goal and whoever gets there first has to buy the other one a ticket to the movies or something else you both really like.",
            "Do odd jobs in your neighborhood. Start asking people in your community if there is any work you can help them with. If they say no, try not to get discouraged, as they might not have extra money to spend at the moment. However, you have at least put the word out that you are available and a few will most likely ask if you can help them out in the future. Some useful jobs you can suggest include:\n\n\nmowing lawns\ncleaning yards\nmending clothing\norganizing storage items in the house\nweeding the garden or pathways\nshoveling snow",
            "Offer to stay at a neighbor’s home when he or she goes out of town. This is called “house-sitting,” and it usually includes taking care of plants, pets and bringing in the mail. In most cases, you go to the person’s home every day and check that everything is okay. In some cases, they may want you to stay the entire time they’re gone.[5]",
            "Think of creative ways to get your parents to help you. Knowing how to save money is a really great thing in life. If you show your parents early on that you can (even if it’s just a little bit at first), they will be more likely to help you.[6]Here are some ideas to consider:\n\n\nGive a gift card that someone gives you to your mom or dad to use, but they have to give you the amount of money the card was worth.\nOpen a bank account that is operated by your parents or guardian on behalf of you. There are many bank account services available for kids. You can opt for term deposit or fixed deposit and get interest from banks on money saved. If you are between the ages of 7 to 10 years old, ask your parents to set up a junior savings account for you.\nBe really good to your parents or whoever gives you your pocket money, and ask for a raise. It’s worth a try. The only thing they can say is no.",
            "Become an entrepreneur. Entrepreneur is a fancy word for \"start your own business,\" and you can never begin too young. For instance, if you have a talent, like playing the guitar or dancing, let people pay you to do it. Also consider making things and selling the items, like hats or scarves you knit. If you live in a neighborhood or subdivision, start a lemonade stand, or purchase candy bars at a discount store and sell them for a profit.",
            "Clean. Do your parents get upset with your sibling if his or her room isn't clean? Offer to clean it for money. If your sibling doesn’t have any, then ask your parents if they will pay you to do it. If they’ve gotten sick of looking at it, they just might take you up on it."

    "wikiHow to Avoid Injury (Massage Therapists)": {
        "intro": "Anyone who works intensively with their hands is prone to injuring their arms, wrists, thumbs, and fingers. Unfortunately, massage therapists are no exception. The arms and hands are just not designed to withstand heavy work over extended periods of time, and repetitive actions can easily lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow and other hand and wrist RSIs. It is rare for massage therapists to be taught how to protect their bodies and this leads to an exceptionally high rate of injury in the profession. Yet the good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. If you know the correct way to position and use your body and hands, you can have a long and healthy career. Protecting your hands is easy when you absorb the principles of dynamic body use; better yet, it also helps to give your clients an even better treatment!",
        "steps": [
            "Use good body mechanics while you work; this will not only help you to avoid injury but enables you to use a more sensitive and powerful touch. Good body mechanics require having a strong energetic connection with the ground through your feet, legs and hara (belly).",
            "Point your stomach towards the subject of your work. Your hara should usually be pointed in the direction of your work. Imagine your hara as a strong light that shines where you are working.",
            "Do not bend. Never bend your back to carry out a move. Lunge forwards in a tai chi stance, or kneel down if necessary.",
            "Use your body weight, not muscular strength, to work deeper. Always remember “lean don’t press.\"",
            "Breathe into your belly. Always find the quiet part within yourself by re-connecting with the breath.",
            "Choose a proper stance. While working, your body should mainly be in one of the four stances described below. Using a massage stance should be a dynamic dance, allowing you to flow from one position to the other, depending on what is best for your body at that time.\n\n\nForward Tai Chi stance: Similar to a lunge. Particularly useful for effleurage based strokes. Weight can transfer between the front and back leg to give power.\nHorse stance: Feet hip width apart and legs bent. Make sure knees roll outwards rather than medially to prevent strain.\nKneeling Tai Chi stance: This can be used to maintain good body mechanics when you need to be at a lower level than standing would allow.\nSeated: Have legs wide apart and both feet firmly connected to the ground. Make sure that your own spine is not slumped.",
            "Take the opportunity to move and dance while you work. Put on some great music, move your hips, and enjoy yourself!",
            "Use breath to remain calm. The breath is a great tool for helping you to calm down, ground yourself, and deepen your intention and pressure while working. Get into the habit of regularly checking into your breath and body while treating; you will find that at moments of stress, you will tend to hold your breath and tense up your whole body. Check into the “space between breaths”, namely, the slight pause after you breathe out and before you breathe in, to remind yourself of the power of “less is more.\"\n\n\nYou can deepen your pressure simply by breathing energy up from the earth through your legs and down your arms and hands.",
            "Use breath to focus. When you feel anxious or not good enough, take a few deep breaths into your belly – this will calm you and slow you down. Remind yourself you are good enough.",
            "Learn to recognize strain. During treatments, use your breath to regularly check into your body. Scan yourself from head to foot to see if anything is feeling strained or tired. If you are hurt, change what you are doing! Also, listen to your body between treatments. If you feel tired, in pain, weepy or irritable after a day's work, you need to change something about what you are doing – less massages per day, or longer gaps between treatments.",
            "Use the principles of “less is more.\" Remember that the best treatments are not those with the most techniques crammed in,the deepest pressure, or the fanciest strokes. Your goal should always be to achieve the outcome that the client desires in the most elegant and energy efficient way. One thoughtful, slow, focused stroke executed with a listening touch is more effective than ten hasty ones. This feels much better too!",
            "Engage properly. Working deeply is not simply the application of deep pressure to the body. It is not a ‘harder’ massage or a more rigorous treatment. It is an experience of engaging the body’s tissue and its structures in a manner that is connected on a ‘deeper’ level. ‘Deeper’ in connection, contact, and awareness. It is not about strength or force but about focus.\n\n\nYou are able to work deeper by using your body weight to lean into the tissues and having the intention and breath to penetrate deeper into the tissues.",
            "Vary things. The more techniques you have in your toolbox, the less chance of having repetitive motion on the same poor muscles. Go on more courses – expand your repertoire.",
            "Know which techniques to avoid. There are many techniques commonly taught in qualifying courses that are best avoided altogether if you are intending to make a living out of massage. These include:\n\n\nPetrissage: “Open c closed c” – This technique uses the hands in the shape of a “C” to lift and push the tissues between them. This is very stressful to the thumbs, hands, and forearm flexors. There are many other ways of creating the outcome of this stroke.\nThumb work: Most therapists have been taught to overuse their fingers and thumbs. Your thumbs should be thought of as the most precious tool you have. Only bring them out when absolutely necessary – approximately 10 percent of the time. Your forearms can do so much of your broad strokes and knuckles and elbows may be employed to get into the specific points.\nWhen you do use your thumbs, make sure they are supported by your loose fist or are flat on the body. Never use your thumb with the MCP joint unsupported.\nEffleurage with deviated wrists: Some therapists have been taught to massage the limbs with hands turned inwards to mould to the contours of the body. As far as possible, wrists and hands should always be kept in line or injury may occur.\nEffleurage from the side of the table: Many therapists learn to massage the back with strokes towards the client’s head from the side of the table. This leads to unnecessary twisting and back strain.\nEffleurage from the head of the table feels just as good to the client and is so much better for your body!",
            "Include still work as part of the massage. It feels great. And it doesn’t hurt your hands. Give yourself permission to spend time holding your clients feet, head, back, or anywhere you feel needs it.\n\n\nFocus and breathe energy into the area."

        "intro": "Many foods could be viewed as \"naughty\" when consuming them results in unusual behavior (disguising it, lying, etc.), or leaves you with feelings of guilt, remorse, and dissatisfaction. For example, it might be the chocolate, cookies, cakes, and fast food that you crave. If you're justifying \"just one or two\" here and there every day, you may soon have a big problem. Make good new habits to prevent yourself from giving into those cravings while you try to stay healthy or even lose weight.",
        "steps": [
            "Don't buy forbidden foods. Make it hard for you to give in. Don't have them sitting around the house tempting you and drawing you in. Resist the temptation to buy naughty or unhealthy foods just because they're on special. Cutting these foods out of your weekly grocery bill will help you save money and keep you from indulging your cravings at weak moments.\n\n\nAsk family members or other members of the household to hide their stashes of problematic foods from you.\nIf you’re worried about giving in at the grocery store, ask someone else to do your shopping for you.",
            "Don’t carry cash. If you are tempted by the vending machine that you walk by every day at work or school, make it impossible for yourself to buy anything. Even if your vending machines take cards, using a card will give you an extra bit of time to think about what you’re doing and keep yourself from actually buying that food.",
            "Distract yourself. If it’s 2 am and you’re craving that naughty food, get online and find something else to do -- a funny video, a new album, a personality quiz -- anything to keep you from thinking and obsessing over food. During the day, take up a new hobby, like gardening, knitting, or going on daily walks.[1]",
            "Determine your naughty foods. Identify the foods you don't want to or should not be eating for nutritional, diet, health, religious, or other reasons but you're indulging in anyway. Think about why they are appealing to you – is there some taste or attribute that you get from those foods that you don’t have in your diet? Some examples that commonly apply include:[2]\n\nFast food on a regular basis, such as fries, burgers, hot dogs, fried anything, etc.\nPastries, cakes, cookies, doughnuts, and other baked goods.\nSugary breakfast cereals.\nFat-laden dishes.\nChocolate and candies.\nFoods that bring on a headache or migraine, hives, rashes, or a general feeling of unwellness (this does not refer to foods that result in severe, life-threatening allergic reactions – you'll be more than aware that you can't indulge in those).\nFoods that seem to impact your complexion or your energy levels poorly.\nFoods that are not supposed be eaten because of your faith-based or other beliefs, such as meat, beef, ham, pork, unfiltered drinking water, etc.\nFoods that leave you feeling guilty or remorseful for eating.",
            "Find your physical triggers. Keep a food journal to see how your life, how you feel, and food are linked. Note what you eat, how you feel, and when you feel cravings. It's important to focus on what causes you to indulge in naughty foods so that you can seek appropriate treatment or remedies. Cravings for food have a number of possible causes, and in some cases it's probably a good idea to discuss the problem with your doctor. In general, the following reasons can trigger food cravings:[3]\n\nBlood sugar levels and insulin levels are not being maintained evenly throughout the day. After spiking, a drop in blood sugar levels can bring on cravings.\nConvenience – some foods, like highly salted, fatty snacks, or sugary ones, are really easy to find in packages and gobble down without any preparation needed. The saltiness or sweetness makes them even more crave-worthy.\nSleep deprivation – whether caused by emotional stress, a medical condition, or some other reason, a lack of sleep can cause you to crave food as a solution to your tiredness.\nPregnancy – cravings during pregnancy can involve foods or non-foods such as clay (known as \"pica\" when the craving is not for food).\nMenopause – women's tastebuds undergo significant changes for post-menopausal women, causing them to crave sweet foods because, ironically, they are less able to taste sweetness.\nHabit – you may simply be so used to a food that you cannot stop indulging in it even though it's not good for you. This is generally a thoughtless form of consuming the food, in that you simply resort to doing it because you've always done it, without questioning its value to your health or well-being.",
            "Think about emotional causes that trigger your cravings. Again, a food journal can help you identify these. Eating due to stress is well-known and is a major trigger for eating naughty foods. Often termed \"comfort food eating\", there is a tendency to eat naughty foods when feeling down to get emotional comfort. A lowered level of serotonin (common in depression) can bring about food cravings as well. Finally, loneliness and alienation can often lead people to eat.[4]",
            "Make a plan. Figure out which foods you most want to get out of your diet. Keep a food journal to see what exactly you are eating, how much, and how you feel afterward (both mentally and physically). It might surprise you. The foods you most want to cut out might be the ones that you turn to most, or they might be the treats that are the least healthy for you. Start with just one food that you want to eliminate from your diet and work on not eating that for a week. Do not replace it with another food, or eat more of other foods you crave to make up for its loss. Try drinking a glass of water instead. It certainly won’t be the same, but it can help fill you up and get you on a path to better eating.[5]\n\nTry to note which foods cause you to overeat or which you have difficulty resisting.",
            "Go slowly. If you have a long history of giving in to food cravings, it’s going to take time to break yourself of the habit. You might need to just work on cutting out one of your naughty foods per week. Be patient as you learn what works and does not work, and most importantly, be gentle on yourself – slip ups are an inevitable part of changing what is, essentially, a bad habit.",
            "Stay away from situations that might make you eat. If there are places or times where you’re more likely to eat naughty foods, steer clear of them. If you can’t see a movie in the theater without your chosen candy, don’t go. If you and a friend always eat cake when you go to a certain restaurant, change it up and go somewhere that doesn't serve cake. Make it harder for you to indulge in your cravings.[6]",
            "Eat regularly and practice portion control. Aim to eat regular, small-sized meals throughout the day that are healthy and well-balanced. This will help to maintain your blood sugar at an even level and prevent craving spikes. Avoid refined carbohydrates as much as possible. As delicious as they are, they stimulate cravings by making your blood sugar spike and then drop dramatically.[7]",
            "Make it really easy to eat foods that aren't naughty. A big reason why many people cannot make food changes is that the alternatives seem \"too hard\". When breaking a habit, use the time to retrain this mindset by finding all of the ways to make it \"too easy\" and replace those naughty foods. Some ways to help yourself include:\n\n\nPurchase pre-cut nibbling vegetables. Or prepare a large amount of vegetables for snacking on over several days and leave in the fridge for the weak moments. It's much easier doing the effort in big batches than hurdling the \"I don't want to prepare it\" excuse at the time you need a snack. Great veggies to keep ready to snack on include: celery, carrot, sugar snap peas, radishes, bean sprouts, etc.\nAlways keep low-fat, delicious dips on hand.\nCreate separate rationed portions with the acceptable calorie/sugar/fat, etc. content per serving. Know that when this portion is consumed, that's it!\nRead how to choose healthy snacks.",
            "Find new treats for yourself that aren’t food. After a week without your top naughty food, do something nice for yourself – go to a movie, buy yourself a new record, whatever would be meaningful to you. Get used to rewarding yourself with experiences and objects, not food.",
            "Exercise. Exercise can balance blood sugar levels and ease your digestion. Do an easy walk after meals to help relieve the cravings. Even a 15-minute walk can do a lot of good. Do a sport or physical activity that you love. In addition to the exercise, doing a sport with other people can help distract you from your food cravings.[8]",
            "Find new interests. Join a new group centered on an interest – a book club, a hiking group, a political organization. You’ll meet new people and get into a new routine and away from old habits. If you’d rather do something alone, learn how to knit or fly fish, for example. Think about something you’ve wanted to try but haven’t, and consider doing it instead of giving in to cravings.[9]",
            "Smell something. Some studies have shown that smelling a non-food odor when you feel a food craving, can diminish that craving. Researchers have used jasmine scent effectively, and in the lab, neutral odors that are unfamiliar to the people smelling them. So get out there and smell some jasmine flowers to stop craving your naughty foods![10]",
            "Face the emotional triggers. If any of your triggers are emotional ones, including stress, sadness, or loneliness, it won't be as simple as finding substitutes, halving proportions and wishing yourself free of the cravings. You'll need support to work on the underlying emotional reasons. This might be by way of counseling or, or through reading widely on overcoming your emotional issues and learning to engage your emotions more constructively. If you're suffering from stress, it's really important to learn the many ways possible to reduce stress that are far more effective than filling your unhappiness with poor quality food.[11]",
            "Try hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy is sometimes used to help reduce cravings and addictions. Your hypnotherapist will likely ask you about your food cravings and the emotions invoked by food prior to hypnotizing you. Expect to be given visual cues and visualizations to help distract you from your naughty food cravings.[12]",
            "Indulge in your naughty foods very occasionally. Don't give up your naughty foods completely. The key is to eat naughty foods in moderation and to leave them for special occasions rather than to indulge in them regularly. Learn to savor the flavor. Aim to really appreciate the flavor of the food you're eating rather than aiming to get it into your stomach as fast as possible.",
            "Face up to your beliefs or health needs. When your naughty indulgences breach your faith-based or other beliefs, or when eating the food leaves you sick, the issue is broader than simply concentrating on your weight or future health.\n\n\nIn the case of breaching your faith-based beliefs, speak to your faith mentor, priest, minister, rabbi and seek solutions to the situation. He or she will likely have some good advice for you, since food cravings butting up against faith-based diets are common.\nIf you're following a particularly strict diet like vegetarian, vegan, fruitarian, raw food, etc., and you're eating food that doesn't align with your dietary and wider ethical beliefs, it's time for a rethink about what you're doing and whether the choice you've made is working for you."

Sterilize the jars, lids, and any utensils you're using in the following way:[1]\n\nPlace them in a large pot and fill it with cold water.\nBring the water to a boil and boil for 10 minutes.\nRemove them with clean tongs and allow them to dry on a clean towel.",
            "Select beetroot at the peak of ripeness. Ideally, beetroot will have been harvested about one month prior to preserving it. This gives the vegetable time to cure and finish ripening, resulting in the best flavor. Look for beetroot that's firm with no visible bruises or soft spot.\n\n\nThough ripe beetroot is best, since preserved beetroot gains flavor from the pickling liquid, you can use beets that are on the older side or aren't quite ripe yet.",
            "Scrub the beetroot. Fresh beetroot is often caked with dirt. Take a vegetable brush and scrub it on all dies to remove the grit. Rinse thoroughly under cold running water. If you find blemishes under the dirt, slice them off with a paring knife.[2]",

            "Boil the beetroot. Place it in a large pot and cover with water. Sprinkle a teaspoon or so of salt into the water, then turn the heat up and bring it to a boil. Boil the beetroot until you can easily stick one with a knife, about 30 minutes. Then remove the pot from heat and drain the water.\n\nIf you have beetroot of varying sizes, place the larger vegetables in the water first.

            "Top off with pickling liquid. Pour it over the beetroot to within half inch of the top of each jar. It's important to leave a bit of headspace at the top of the jar to prevent too much pressure from accumulating there. Place the lids on the jars and tighten them.\n\n\nIf you see air bubbles in the jars, tap the bottoms of the jars lightly against the counter top to make them float to the top and pop.",
            "Let the jars cool completely. Set them on the counter and let them cool overnight before storing.",
            "Allow the beetroot to pickle for at least a week before opening. During this time the pickling liquid will penetrate the beetroot to add flavor and change the texture. You may enjoy the beetroot at any time after one week has passed.\n\n\nBeetroot preserved this way will keep up to three months in a cool, dark place.\nOnce you open a jar, store it in the refrigerator."

    "wikiHow to Use Cement Additives": {
        "intro": "Cement is a man made mineral based powder which goes through a chemical change or reaction when mixed with water. First it becomes like an adhesive paste, and eventually hardens, but it has virtually no uses on its own.",
        "steps": [
            "Take precautions before you start. Most cement additives are non-flammable and non-hazardous in normal use but sensible precautions should be taken when using them in much the same way as when using cement which is an alkaline product.\n\n\nAvoid skin contact as much as possible. If contact does occur or if liquid is accidentally splashed in the eyes wash out thoroughly in clean water. You should wash anyway after using cement and additives, before eating or allowing hand to mouth contact.\nShould any liquid be swallowed, seek medical advice immediately",
            "Store properly. All additives should be stored in a frost free place within the temperature range 5° - 30° C.",
            "Pun or vibrate the concrete. To achieve the greatest resistance, it is essential that concrete is well punned or vibrated to eliminate trapped air.",
            "Understand the effect of the additive. It is to 'plasticise' the mix, reducing the amount of gauging water required, giving the mix additional strength and flexibility to prevent it cracking or crazing during a more controlled drying out period. It provides a compact easily worked mix when wet with a smoother hard wearing, less dusty surface when dry.\n\n\nThe improved adhesion of the mix helps considerably when used for mortar rendering purposes. The liquid can be used with all types of Portland Cement, but not with high alumina cements. It is simply mixed with water 1:30 and added to the cement/aggregate mix as the gauging water to the required consistency.",
            "Use a mortar plasticizer. It has all the advantages of lime and none of the disadvantages. This liquid admixture plasticises a cement/sand mix using less gauging water than usual, giving an easily workable 'fatty' mortar with strong adhesion. It has a reasonably fast initial setting period but leaves ample time for the adjustment of bricks.\n\n\nWhen dry the mortar with added plasticiser is more resistant to the effects of frost than a standard cement/sand/lime mix.",
            "Add the plasticiser to the gauging water at a rate of 1⁄5 liter (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser to 20 liters (5.3 US gal) of water.\n\n\nIt is normal practice to mix sufficient plasticiser and water in a large tub to provide a uniform strength for several mixes of cement and sand.\nAs a rough guide, you will need to mix in 0.28 liters (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser with water for every 50Kg of cement.",
            "Allow to self-mix. The granules have a self-mixing action simply by being added to a dry mortar or concrete mix, then turned over in the normal way before the gauging water is added. The amount of colourant used will affect the shade produced so a careful check must be kept when mixing successive batches that the same quantity is used each time. As a guide, 2-10kg per 100kg of cement is recommended.\n\n\nNote that shading is affected by the colour of aggregates used.\nCement Dyes are made from synthetic oxides, complying with BS 1014.",
            "Add a concrete dustproofer and surface hardener. It is a ready-to-use alkaline solution of tough silicate material which combines with softer lime-free particles in conventional concrete mixes to form a harder surface which resists wear and dusting.\n\n\nIt can be used on old concrete in basically good condition or on new concrete laid at least 14 days before.",
            "Pour the dust-proofer in the concrete. Provided the concrete is clean and free from surface water, the dust-proofer is simply poured onto the floor and spread out with a soft broom, then left to dry for 40 minutes. The floor is then washed with clean water.",
            "Add more if needed. On very porous floors a second or third coat should be applied with 40-60 minutes between coats.\n\n\nPonding should be removed after 10 minutes. 40-60 minutes after the final coat the floor should be washed with clean water.\nWhen coloured pigments have been used on concrete or granolithic flooring, it is advisable to test treat a small area first to check that Dustproofer has no adverse effects on the colour.",
            "Place sheeting down for summer laying. In very hot weather where concrete has been laid in direct sunlight, polythene sheeting or damp sacking should still be placed over the surface to prevent the top drying out at a faster rate than the remainder.",
            "Take precautions with winter laying. In winter, the concrete will still harden much more quickly than usual and is protected against sudden temperature drops but you should still take the precautions generally associated with cold weather concreting, such as laying polythene sheeting covered with sacks, expanded polystyrene or a similar insulant over the concrete to preserve the heat generated during the drying process.",
            "Use with the correct cement. Frost Proofer and Rapid Hardener should only be used with ordinary and rapid hardening Portland Cement. It should not be used with high alumina cements, sulphate resistant cements, extra rapid hardening Portland Cement, lime mortars or in mixes intended for steam curing. The admixture which contains calcium chloride should also not be used in steel reinforced concrete or for pre-stressed concrete work.\n\n\nThe admixture is added to gauging water at the rate of 1.7 liters (0.4 US gal) for each 50 Kg of cement.",
            "In winter, the gauging water should be at temperature of not less than 20°C particularly when the air temperature is close to zero. When mixed and laid the concrete should be no colder than 10Â°C. At no time should the component parts of the mix be allowed to become frozen.",
            "Use internally or externally. Generally used for exterior rendering, it can also be used internally for making good after the installation of injected damp proof courses.",
            "Add the admixture to the gauging water at a ratio of 1 part admixture to 30 parts water.",
            "Calculate at 500–1,000 milliliters (16.9–33.8  fl oz) per 50kg of cement."

Situations like this are almost always exclusively awkward for you as you feel either ignored by a couple or berated by questions about your own love life. Being comfortable when you're the third wheel or the only single one in the group will be about planning, distracting yourself, and keeping the right attitude.",
        "steps": [
            "Go easy on the conversation. The worst feeling as a third wheel is never knowing how or when to be a part of a conversation between two romantic partners. Sometimes it’ll feel like you’re stuck on somebody’s else date, and maybe you are. So don’t be afraid not to participate when it doesn’t feel right.[1]\n\nNaturally, always speak when spoken to. Don’t be purposefully un-talkative or it might come off as rude.\nChime in every once and awhile, especially in conversations the topics of which don’t involve their relationship. If they start talking about future plans, or reminiscing together, feel free to opt out.",
            "Don’t make it awkward. While it may certainly be an awkward situation for you, nothing will compound the awkwardness worse than acting awkwardly in response. Not butting into conversations that seem personal to the relationship is important here; being comfortable with your single-dom is crucial here as well.\n\n\nDon’t point it out. You may feel compelled to make light of your situation by addressing it outright: “Feels weird being the only one here without a girlfriend;” “Always awkward being the third wheel, right?” Don’t make it seem any more than a conversation between friends.\nLet them go on in conversation. Sometimes being around others in a relationship will mean hearing about those relationships, possibly for a long time. Accept the situation and let them talk. It’s better than shifting the impetus of the conversation to yourself.",
            "Keep a friendly contact. When the couple you’re with is droning on to one another, or friends in relationships are chatting endlessly about fun couples activities, it’ll help to have a friend to text during the boredom. Use them to blow off steam about the awkwardness or poor conversation.",
            "Never take sides. If you’re stuck with a couple who has begun a disagreement, things can get uncomfortable fast. Many times couples will want you to weigh in on their squabble; don’t. You’ll only alienate one or the other of the people you’re with. Be upfront about your neutrality.\n\n\n\"Hey, let's not do this now. Try to keep it civil, we're out to have fun!\"\n\"I'm not going to be roped into your argument; why don't we try having a good time since we're out together?\nFortunately this is a situation where it’s alright to speak a little more plainly, or to voice your awkward position. Hopefully they’ll understand the spot they’re putting you in and back off.\n\n\"You know it's not nice to put me on the spot like this. You guys can argue, but I'm not going to be a part of it.\"\n\n\nBe sure to keep up this neutrality after the fact. Even if there’s one or the other you agree with, don’t reveal this later on. It’ll make you come off as dishonest.",
            "Use your friends as wingmen. Couples can be a big help when you're out and looking for someone to introduce yourself to. Any awkward discussion of your personal life can be avoided by turning the conversation on them by asking their opinion on someone. Unsurprisingly, many couples or friends in relationships will delight in your asking them for dating advice.[2]\n\nFinding someone else to chat with also means escaping your situation for a bit. This itself isn’t a bad opener for introducing yourself: “Do you mind if I sit here? I have to get away from this couple I’m with.”\nIf it’s something you can control in advance, demand they bring another single friend as a set-up. People in relationships often jump to play matchmaker, and it will at least give you a single person to speak to.",

If the couple you’re with is reasonable, they won’t mind you entertaining yourself while they talk amongst themselves. Be sure not to be completely absent, however; only go for the phone when it’s a conversation you clearly don’t have to be a part of.[3]\n\nIf you’re not with a couple, but instead are stuck as the only single one in a group of friends, it unfortunately won’t do to use your phone to avoid the awkward parts of that situation. In that case your only distraction will be to change the subject.",

            "Have other conversation in mind. As mentioned previously, changing the subject may be the only certain way to avoid the awkward conversation topics which normally befall the single in the group. Feel free when doing this to be a little obvious; anyone especially perceptive with you should take the hint and join in.\n\n\nDiscuss your surroundings. If you're in a bar or restaurant, talk about your food or drinks. Talk about the atmosphere, the decor; talk about the music they're playing.\nTalk about the near future. Vacations planned and events taking place are good fodder for conversation. Take an interest in what your friends have got going on in their lives.\nTry to expand on any one topic. If you end up talking about the decor of the bar, talk about how you might change it. If you talk about the music in the bar, stretch that to talking about music you like.",
            "Change your scenery. Unless you're locked into something like a dinner or a particular event, suggest a change of location to shake things up. Having the group move and do something new helps to move any attention away from you. Even the discussion of \"what to do now\" can work as distraction enough when desperate.\n\n\nWhat you suggest will depend on where you are. If you're at a bar, look around for a dartboard, pool table, or air hockey. Games are a great distraction from conversation.\nIf pressed for ideas, just suggest walking the town. It'll give you and your group a chance to see what else there is to do.",

Your friend(s) in a relationship might feel like they’ve neglected you, so they’ve offered an invitation to what would normally be their couples activity. Unfortunately in this instance there’s some pressure on you to be grateful.\nYou may have been enlisted as a distraction. Maybe the relationship involved isn’t going smoothly or the two involved want to spend time together, but not only together. Here you’ll do a courtesy to your friend(s) by being engaged.\nIt could just be an accident. You’re out with a friend and their significant other just happens to be around the corner. The friend doesn’t want to end your night but doesn’t want to snub their partner. Though it might not be any fun for you, there’s nothing wrong with bowing out in this scenario.",
            "Be in control if you’re the only single one. If you’re in a situation where you’re not stuck between in a couple, but are spending time with friends in relationships, things might feel awkward for you. Fortunately it’s only talk of significant others or prodding into your love life which should make you feel uncomfortable. Steer clear of these by directing the conversation away from sensitive areas.\n\n\nTurn the tables and inquire into their love lives. If you’re stuck out with friends in relationships who feel like offering unsolicited advice, get them talking about their own relationships. If you’re with a number of people who aren’t single, they may just turn to each other for conversation leaving you comfortably out.\nWhen among close friends, feel free to give an honest “I don’t feel like talking about this/that.” Anyone who presses will have to suffer coming across as rude.",
            "Be a part of the planning. Sometimes the setting of a get-together can make your position as the only single one much worse. Dinners or nights out at a bar are constricting, and limit you to only conversation as the source of entertainment. Insist on being in on the planning, and don’t fear being honest about why.[6]\n\nSuggest something active. This might be as plain as moving the group from the bar to the dart board. Or going to a bowling alley or pool hall. Look for anything that’ll allow you interaction without conversation.\nTry something among a crowd, like a concert. If they insist on a mutual outing, something like a movie or a band’s show would be useful because it doesn’t allow for much interaction. That way you avoid the conversational troubles that come with being the only single one."

In order to find this cost, you need to determine the area of the pizza, which can be found by using basic formulas. As long as you know the price and dimensions of the pizzas, you can find out which restaurant offers the best value.\n",
        "steps": [
            "Set up the formula for the area of a circle. The formula is A=π(r2){\\displaystyle A=\\pi (r^{2})} where r{\\displaystyle r} equals the length of the circle’s radius.[1]",

To find the length of the radius, you have to divide the diameter in half.\n\nFor example, if you are ordering a 20 inch pizza, calculate 20÷2=10{\\displaystyle 20\\div 2=10}. So the radius of the pizza is 10 inches.",
            "Plug the length of the radius into the formula. Remember to substitute for the variable r{\\displaystyle r}.\n\nFor example, if the radius is 10 inches, your formula will look like this: A=π(102){\\displaystyle A=\\pi (10^{2})}.",
            "Square the length of the radius. To square a number, multiply it by itself.\n\nFor example, if the radius is 10 inches, you would calculate 10×10=100{\\displaystyle 10\\times 10=100}, so your formula will now look like this: A=π(100){\\displaystyle A=\\pi (100)}.",
            "Multiply by π{\\displaystyle \\pi }. You can use a calculator, or use 3.14 for π{\\displaystyle \\pi }.

        "intro": "The use of hypnosis to help improve your memory is a common technique for therapists to help their patients remember traumatic childhood memories and law enforcement officials trying to get eyewitnesses to remember key details of a scene or event.[1] A study done by a research team at Ohio State University found that memories recovered through hypnosis need to be verified by other sources before it can be used as evidence in a case or as proof of a traumatic experience for a patient in therapy.[2] But you can use hypnosis to get better at recalling information you may have forgotten, like the code to a safe or a password, or retain information you may need later for a test or exam through hypnotizing yourself or being hypnotized by a professional hypnotist.",
        "steps": [
            "Be aware of how hypnotism works. Contrary to popular belief, hypnosis does not put you to sleep, render you unconscious, put you under someone’s spell, or cause you to do anything you do not want to do. In fact, hypnosis is a state of mind where you are very focused on suggestions being made to you and you are more receptive to these suggestions. In order for hypnosis to be effective, you will need to have an open and uncritical attitude towards hypnosis. Avoid being resistant to the process, as the more skeptical you are, the less effective hypnosis will be on you.[3]\n\nTo use hypnosis to improve your memory, you will need to store information in your brain and be able to retrieve it while under hypnosis. This is similar to the memory palace method, which is a type of mnemonic, a learning device that can help you recall difficult information. You can picture your memory palace when you’re in hypnosis and use it to store information you may need to retain later.",
            "Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet, dim room. This will help you to relax and focus. You can also take off your shoes, put on loose clothing, and put a blanket on your legs.",
            "Choose an object in the room to focus on. Use an object that you have a strain a bit to focus on, about five to seven feet away from you. This could be the corner of a picture frame on the wall, a smudge on the wall, a tree out the window, etc.[4]\n\nAs you look at the spot, repeat these words silently to yourself: “My eyelids are becoming heavier and heavier. My eyelids feel as if they are being pulled down by a heavy weight. Soon they will so heavy they will close.”\nRepeat these words every 30 seconds and focus on your eyelids. You should feel them start to get heavy and close. Allow them to feel heavy and let the sensation of heaviness happen. Let your eyes close when they are ready to close on their own. As your eyes start to close, say: “Relax, and let go.”",
            "Inhale and exhale deeply. Once your eyes have closed, take a deep inhale through your nose and hold the breath for 10 seconds. Then, exhale through slightly parted lips, making an ocean like sound or a “whooshing” sound.[5]\n\nAs you inhale and exhale, let your head fall towards your chest and allow a wave of warmth and heaviness spread from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Breathe slowly and consistently. Say the word “calm” every time you exhale.\nAfter several breaths, say the word “deeper” as you exhale. This will allow you to go deeper into hypnosis. Imagine you are on a descending escalator that will take you into a deeper state of relaxation. Think to yourself, “I am slowly sinking into a deeper state of relaxation.”\nAs you descend on the escalator, count backwards from 10 to 1. Once you reach the bottom of the escalator, picture yourself stepping off the escalator and stepping onto a second descending escalator. Continue to breathe deeply in and out, counting backwards again from 10 to 1.",
            "Store information in your memory as you go into a deeper trance. As you fall into a deeper trance, you can start to store information in your memory. If you are familiar with a memory palace, you can imagine yourself going into your memory palace. You can then picture an icon or symbol that represents the subject or content you are studying or trying to remember in a main room of your memory palace. For example, if you are studying for a high school chemistry exam, you may want to picture a key chemistry equation when you are in a deep trance. If you are studying for a law exam, you may picture a legal symbol that is essential to the content you are trying to remember.[6]\n\nContinue to picture your visual cue as you are in this trance so your brain can retain the visual cue. You can then call on this visual cue as you are studying for the exam or test to help you remember the information.\nYou should practice going into a trance like state before you begin studying for a test and after you have finished a study session. This will give your brain an opportunity to retain more information at the end of every study session.",
            "Count backwards from five to one to come out of the trance. Once you feel you have reached a deep hypnotic state, you feel totally relaxed, and you have noted your visual cues, you can bring yourself out of the trance by counting backwards from five.[7]\n\nBefore you do the count, you can say to yourself, “When I get to one, my eyes will open and I will be awake.” As you do the count, your eyes should start to flutter open and then be fully open and alert once you reach one.",
            "Seek out a professional hypnotist that specializes in memory recall. Many people use professional hypnotists to help them remember important details of an event, work through a trauma, or remember where they placed important information. You can look for hypnotists who specialize in memory recall through an online search.[8]\n\nIn a typical session with a professional hypnotist, you will be put under a light trance and the hypnotist will use oral cues to guide you. You can ask the hypnotist to help you remember where you put an important document or password, or you can ask for help to better retain information and improve your memory.",
            "Get a referral for a trained therapist who does hypnosis from your doctor. Your doctor may be able to suggest a medical professional who practices hypnosis. When hypnosis is performed by a trained therapist or a healthcare professional, hypnosis is considered a safe alternative medicine by the medical community.[9]\n\nKeep in mind hypnosis is often used by medical professionals to help with medical conditions like controlling pain due to disease or illness, hot flashes, behavioral changes such as phobias and smoking, and fatigue or exhaustion.[10] While there have been some studies done in the medical community on the effectiveness of hypnosis to retain information and improve memory recall, it is not considered a primary function of hypnosis as an alternative medical option.",
            "Watch online videos of hypnosis. There are several online videos that can guide you through hypnosis specifically for memory retention and better information recall. Often, doing self-hypnosis with the aid of an audio guide from a professional hypnotist in an online video can help you to get into a trance like state and deepen your trance."

This will close off your breathing.[2]\n\nTo get a better sense of correct posture and breathing, start by lying on the floor. Place a book on your abdomen. Breathe in and out. Notice if the book rises and falls as you inhale and exhale.\nFrom lying down, you can move to your hands and knees. As you breathe in this position, notice if your abdomen rises and falls as you inhale and exhale. Your chest should stay steady and not collapse.\nOnce you feel comfortable with breathing in your abdomen or diaphragm, try to breathe in a standing position.",
            "Keep your mouth open as you sing. This seems like a no-brainer, but many singers do not open their mouths open as wide as they should. Less space in your mouth means less sound coming out of your mouth, and less resonance to your voice.[3]\n\nTest this with the two finger rule. Try to fit two fingers between your teeth while singing, especially when singing open vowels like “ah” and “oh”. If you can fit two fingers between your teeth, you are opening your mouth correctly. If you can’t fit two fingers, open your mouth wider.",
            "Open the front area of your face. Singing from the front area of your face, just under your eyes and around your nose, can create a fuller, richer resonance to your voice.[4]\n\nSay the word “hung”, drawing out the “ng”. Notice how the back of your throat feels closed and the sound comes out of the frontal area of your face, including your nose.\nSay the word “hung” again, drawing out the “ng”. This time, move your tongue down towards the bottom of your mouth. Sing “hung”, drawing out the “ng” so it sounds like “hungahhh”. Now, you are accessing the front area of your face as you sing.",
            "Keep the back of your mouth open. This is equally as important as keeping the front of your mouth open. If the back of your mouth is closed off, the quality of your voice will be off.\n\n\nHold the “ng” sound in “hung”. Note how closed off the back of your mouth feels.\nSay “ah” like you’re in the doctor’s office. Note how open the back of your mouth feels.\nTry to leave the back of your mouth open like the “ah” sound to create a beautiful resonance in your voice.",
            "Make sure your larynx remains steady as you sing. Your larynx is where your Adam’s apple is on your neck (or where it would be for ladies). Notice if this area of your neck is rising or falling while singing. If so, you are throwing off your voice and letting your larynx get in the way of your vocal tone.\n\n\nA raised larynx can also cause your voice to crack.\nRest your hand on your larynx while singing to make sure it stays steady.",
            "Try to open your jaw more when you sing. This is a great trick to improving your singing voice.[5]\n\nStand in front of a mirror. Say A-E-I-O-U. Notice if your jaw closed on any of the vowels.\nChances are your jaw closed on the E and the U, as well as other vowels.\nTake your two fingers and pull your jaw down 2 inches. You can also use a plastic bottle cap or wine cork to prop your jaw open.\nSay the vowels again. And again. Now, sing the vowels on one pitch: A-E-I-O-U. You want to keep your jaw open (long, not wide) so it doesn’t close for any of the vowels. Keep singing the vowels until you can keep your jaw open.\nTry to sing a phrase or line from a song. Make sure your jaw opens to the same position on all the vowels. Practice this until it becomes natural.\nYour voice should sound louder and more resonant, with less strain.",
            "Tip your chin down when you sing. This simple technique will help you get more power in your voice without straining it.[6]\n\nStand in front of a mirror. Keep your chin pointed slightly down and your pectorals (or chest area) flexed.\nSing an “ah” scale up and down (1-2-3-4-3-2-1). Press your chin in, towards the floor.\nDon’t let your head bob around as you go up and down the scale. Your chin may want to raise up when you get to the higher pitch but keep it down.\nThis adjustment should give you more power and control over your vocals.",
            "Warm up your voice before every practice. This will help to protect your voice and to improve your vocal range.[7]\n\nThe length of your warm up routine depends on the type of singing you are practicing. A classical singer who uses the higher octaves of their voice may need more warm up time than a singer of a contemporary genre who is only using a limited vocal range. As well, a belter may need more warm up time than someone who sings soft, gentle children’s songs.\nThe time of day you are singing may also affect your warm up time. Many singers need more time to warm up in the mornings because their voice has not been used for many hours (during sleep). If you have seasonal allergies, you may need to have a longer warm up to remove any excess mucus in your throat and lungs.",
            "Release your jaw. This exercise will help to reduce any tension in your mouth or jaw. Loosening up your jaw will also help to loosening up your voice.[8]\n\nPlace the heels of your hands directly below your cheekbones.\nPush in and down from the cheeks to your jaw line, massaging your facial muscles.\nAllow your jaw to open as you move your hands down your face.\nRepeat this several times.",
            "Do lip trills. Lip trills are an exercise where you blow air through your pursed lips, letting out a sound on any given pitch. You can do any scales, intervals, melody patterns, or even whole songs on the lip trill.\n\n\nTo do a lip trill, you need to have an even flow of air, very relaxed lips, and control of your breathing. The air pressure must be constant but not too high.[9]\n\nBegin by trying to make an “h” sound during a lip trill. Then, try a “b” sound.\nIf you can’t get your lips to buzz, lift them slightly with your fingers. Think of holding the vowel U inside your mouth to keep your larynx relaxed. But don’t push or strain your vocal chords.",
            "Do tongue trills. This exercise will relax your tongue and engage your breathing and your voice.[10]\n\nPlace your tongue behind your upper teeth.\nExhale and trill your tongue with an “r” sound. Hold the sound steady and keep your breath connected.\nTry to vary your pitch up and down the scale while trilling. Avoid straining or pushing your voice beyond what is comfortable for you.",
            "Practice two octave scales. This exercise will allow your vocal folds to stretch and expand.\n\n\nStart in a low pitch and glide up the scale, making a “me” sound. Don’t push the top or bottom of your range. Instead, try to increase the range every time you do the scales.[11]\n\nReverse and glide down the scale from top to bottom, making an “e” sound.\nTry to do this exercise on an “oo” sound.",
            "Practice the kazoo buzz. This exercise will improve the sound of your voice and stretch your vocal folds.[12]\n\nPretend you are sucking spaghetti as you inhale. On the exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound like a buzz.\nHold the buzz steady. Repeat the sound 2-3 times.\nUse the “woo” sound to go up and down the scales.",
            "Do humming exercises. Humming is a great way to warm up your voice. It highlights the frontal vibrations in your lips, teeth, and face. Humming is also a good way to cool down your voice at the end of a warm up.[13]\n\nBegin with your lips closed and your jaw loose. Breath in and exhale while saying “hum”.\nMake a nasal sound with “hum” and glide down from a high to a low pitch, as if you are sighing.\nYou should feel tickling vibrations in your lips and nose as you hum.",
            "Prevent getting a cold with a healthy diet and lots of rest. A singer needs to take good care of his or her voice by also taking care of the entire body. Eat a balanced diet and get enough sleep every night to boost your immune system.[14]\n\nDon’t let health issues or sickness affect your voice.",
            "Maintain a daily cardio routine. This will help to increase your lung capacity and stamina. Having good lung capacity will help you during performances, especially if you are moving around on stage or dancing while singing.",
            "Stay hydrated. Drink room temperature water throughout the day. Avoid cold water as it can have a numbing effect on your throat and make it more difficult to use your vocal chords.",
            "Avoid smoking. Cigarette smoke can dry out your lungs and vocal folds. This will make breathing during singing more difficult and lessen your vocal quality.[15]\n\nYou should also avoid dairy products. They can create mucus in your throat that can muffle your voice.\nIf possible, avoid taking medications that have a drying effect on your throat or that might irritate your throat.",
            "Adjust your technique if you feel any discomfort or pain when you sing. Pain is almost always a sign of an unhealthy singing technique. The old adage “no pain, no gain” does not apply to singing.[16]\n\nPain and discomfort can be anything from hoarseness, unsteadiness, an inability to sing at a softer volume, and a voice that cuts out. If you feel pain or experience any of these symptoms, rest your voice, and consult a throat specialist.\nOnce your voice has recovered, adjust your vocal techniques so you do not damage your voice again.",
            "Research vocal coaches in your area. Look up vocal coaches in your area online. Watch their example videos to get a sense of their teaching style and their demeanor as a coach.[17]\n\nKeep in mind, a good singer does not always make a good vocal coach. A good vocal coach should be able to explain singing concepts well and be willing to guide your through even the most basic singing techniques.\nAnother good way to find a quality vocal coach is to ask any friends, colleagues, or peers who are strong singers to recommend a vocal coach they have used themselves or heard good things about.[18]",
            "Discuss your goals and expectations with the vocal coach. If possible, meet the teacher in person first before you hire them. Ask them several questions to ensure you will be comfortable taking lessons from them:[19]\n\nWhat is your teaching methodology, and how are lessons conducted?\nWhat is the strength in my singing voice, and how would I use it and build on it?\nWhat is the weakness in my singing voice, and how would you guide me to correct or improve on it?\nIf the vocal coach cannot answer these three questions, they may not have enough experience to help you or they have not thought deeply enough about how to conduct singing lessons.",
            "Be prepared to sing badly before you sing well. This applies not only to working with a vocal coach but with working on your singing in general. Singing, even badly at first, will help you identify the flaws in your voice and improve your technique. A good vocal coach will be supportive of your learning, even if you start off with a rocky or rough singing voice.[20]"

This will make your vocabulary better and it will also help you learn grammar and slang.\n\n\nRead comics. An easy option, if you don't want to read children's books, is to read comic books or comics instead. You can buy many English language comic books in bookstores and online, or you can read free comics online (these are usually called webcomics).\nRead books you've read before. If you already know a little bit about what happens, then you will have an easier time guessing and understanding the words.\nRead the newspaper. Newspapers are a good way to learn the basics of a language, because they usually have very good grammar and are written to be easy to understand. You can find online versions of many good English language newspapers, like the New York Times or The Guardian.",
            "Watch movies. Watching movies will also help you improve your English, by helping you to hear what it sounds like and also helping you to learn new words. You can start watching with subtitles on, but you will learn more with the subtitles off. Once you have a basic vocabulary, try to keep the subtitles off and focus on listening for the words you do know and guessing the words you don't know from what is happening on the screen.",

    "wikiHow to Write a Prologue for Your Novel": {
        "intro": "The prologue appears at the very beginning of a novel as a section before the first chapter of the book. A good prologue will feel essential to the novel and not just a bonus chapter or a stalling tactic on the part of the writer. To write an effective prologue for your novel, you will need to first recognize the purpose of a prologue, create one (or several) drafts of the prologue and edit the prologue down so it is polished and ready for print.",
        "steps": [
            "Use the prologue to provide backstory. One way to use a prologue is to provide backstory on a character or several characters. This can help you, as the writer, avoid using other tricks like flashbacks or inserted backstory in the novel. This option is useful if you are struggling to cover the details of a character’s past within the action of your novel.[1]\n\nHowever, many writers argue against using a prologue as a way to dump a whole bunch of backstory, or past information, on the reader. Instead, the backstory in the prologue should feel essential to the rest of the novel and contain information that could not be placed anywhere else in the novel.\nA backstory heavy prologue should reveal the origin of the quest or mission in the novel and provide the reader with information about the past that leads up to the present action in the novel. This could be the history behind an event, like a war or a conflict, that is touched on in the novel or the history of a character who is important to the novel.[2]",
            "Have the prologue hook the reader into the rest of the novel. Many writers use a prologue as a hook that intrigues the reader. This type of prologue should raise compelling questions in the reader’s mind. It should give the reader a reason to turn the page and set up the reader with questions and/or images that will be addressed in the novel.[3]\n\nA hook prologue could present a scene that introduces character and action that become very important in the novel. It could also foreshadow what is going to happen and allow your reader to briefly meet one of your characters or several of your characters.",
            "Use the prologue as a way to frame the rest of the novel. Some writers will use a prologue as a framing device, where a character is motivated to sit down and write the novel. The character in the prologue will then serve as the narrator for the novel.[4]\n\nThis method can be effective if your novel is voice driven and dominated by one narrator or one to two narrators. Writers will use prologues this way if they feel they need to let the reader know why the story is being told.",
            "Focus on a different character perspective in the prologue. Sometimes, a prologue is used to introduce a character’s point of view only once. The rest of the novel may be told from another point of view or several other point of views, and never focus again on the character in the prologue. This option is usually only done out of necessity or for a compelling reason, as you want the character's perspective to contribute to the novel as a while or reinforce themes or ideas present in the novel.[5]\n\nThis type of prologue gives you the opportunity to use a point of view that is not used much or at all in the rest of the novel. It also prevents you from violating your POV later in the novel, as you have already addressed the one character’s point of view in your prologue.",
            "Choose which type of prologue fits your story. To write an effective prologue, you need to first consider which prologue type fits with your novel. Often, prologues are written after the novel has been completed or when a novel is in its finishing stages. If you are writing a prologue cold, with no other chapters written, you should still think about how the prologue is going to affect the rest of the book.[6]\n\nThink about how the prologue is going to enhance your novel and feel integral to the story. Will it reveal character, setting, or point of view? Will it provide backstory or frame the rest of the novel in a particular way?\nIf you are writing a prologue for a completed book, you should also think about how the prologue will interact with your first chapter. The prologue should hook your reader in and be just as strong as the details and scenes in your first chapter, if not better. The prologue should not regurgitate details in the first chapter or feel redundant in any way, as this will likely lead to a boring and dry prologue.",
            "Create a scene with sensory details. Often, prologues are set within a scene, especially in action and thriller novels. This gives the prologue a fast pace and helps to engage the reader right away. You should think about which scene or scenes you would like to use in your prologue. This may be based on the character voice you decide to use for the prologue.[7]\n\nUse the five senses to make the scene come alive for the reader, with a focus on what the scene smells like, feels like, sounds like, and of course, how it looks. Have your character interact with these elements in the scene and use your character as a way for your reader to access the scene.",
            "Aim for a prologue with one to two scenes. Most prologues are successful if they are short and to the point. Try to use only one to two scenes in the prologue, as too many scenes can make the prologue feel too long and drawn out. Often, using one powerful scene as the prologue can be very effective and draw the reader in right away.[8]\n\nAvoid hopping around in time a lot in your prologue, as this can make the prologue feel confusing or jumpy to the reader. Try to stay in one time period or within one to two time periods so the prologue does not become too long.",
            "Use a specific character voice. If you decide to use your prologue as a way to access a certain character’s point of view, make sure you get into the voice of your character. Think about how the character might speak to others and to themselves. Consider the age, background, and gender of the character, and how this might inform the character’s voice or style of narration.[9]\n\nIf you are using the prologue as a way to access a character that does not appear again in the novel or only appears as a minor character, use the prologue to really explore the character’s perspective. This is your opportunity to show the reader more about the character and delve into what makes the character tick.",
            "Put backstory in the prologue. If the purpose of your prologue is to reveal the past moments in a character’s life or to discuss the history of a character, you should make sure there is enough backstory in the draft. Include engaging details from the character’s past and have the character show why these details are important or necessary to the rest of the story. Though the backstory should be about the character, it should also connect to the larger themes or ideas in the novel.[10]",
            "Keep the prologue short and to the point. A good prologue is usually no more than three to four pages total. Read over your draft and trim it down. Remove any details are are not necessary to the overall story or nice to have. Keeping your prologue short and to the point will make it that much more effective and ensure your reader stays engaged enough to move on to chapter 1.[11]",
            "Make sure the pace is fast and engaging. The pace of the prologue should be quick and brisk. Avoid over explaining something or giving away too much information to the reader, as you will have an entire novel to do this. You do not need to cram the prologue with information that might fit somewhere else in the novel. Keep only the essential details.[12]\n\nOne way to check the pace of the prologue is to read it out loud to yourself or to someone else. Mark any run on sentences or awkward moments in the draft and work them over until they sound smooth and to the point.",
            "Look at how the prologue fits with the rest of your novel. Once you have edited your prologue, you should place it in front of your chapter 1 and look at how it fits. Does it feel like an engaging start? Does it contain any information that is also in chapter 1? Does it strengthen the novel overall?[13]\n\nYour prologue should be strong enough to stand on its own, separate from the novel. It should almost read like a short story, with a contained story line and a conflict. However, unlike a short story, the ending of your prologue should remain open. It can introduce a conflict that will be resolved or addressed later in the novel, leaving the reader wanting more."

        "intro": "Birria is a popular Mexican stew made with roasted meat and hot chile peppers. This dish can be prepared in an oven, on the stove, or in a slow cooker.",
        "steps": [
            "Choose the meat. Traditional birria is made with goat meat, but you can make the dish with beef, lamb, or pork instead if these types of meats are easier for you to find or more palatable to your family or dinner guests. Regardless of the type of meat you select, look for a hindquarter cut.\n\n\nThe meat can either be bone-in or boneless. Bone-in meat can take longer to cook, but cooking the stew while the bones are still in the meat can result in a more flavorful sauce. On the other hand, boneless cuts of meat are usually easier to work with and often cook to done in less time.",
            "Trim and cut the meat. Use a sharp knife to cut the fat off the meat. Cut the meat into two to four chunks.\n\n\nYou do not need to cut the meat into serving portions at this point. You simply need to cut the meat into smaller portions so that it will be easier to brown. Note that smaller portions will also take less time to cook.",
            "Brown the meat. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) vegetable oil to a large Dutch oven or skillet. Heat on medium-high, then add the meat and cook it in the hot oil until all sides have browned evenly.\n\n\nIf you plan on cooking the stew on the stove or in the oven, you should use a Dutch oven for this step. Once the meat has browned, cover the Dutch oven and temporarily remove it from the heat until the rest of the stew is ready.\nIf you plan on cooking the stew in a slow cooker, you could use a large skillet for this step, instead. After browning the meat, remove it from the heat source and temporarily set it aside.\nBrowning the meat is not an essential step, but doing so can enhance the flavor of the dish, so it is strongly recommended nonetheless.",
            "Choose the chiles. The types of chile most often used for this dish are guajillos, pasillas, anchos, and cascabels. You can stick with just one chile type if you strongly prefer its flavor, or you can add further dimension to the flavor profile of the dish by using a combination of these peppers.[1]\n\nGuajillos are medium-hot chiles. When used fresh, they are known as mirasol chiles.\nAnchos, also called mulatos when dried, have a mild heat profile and are known as poblanos when used fresh.\nPasillas are sometimes confused with anchos or even marketed as such for their similar appearance and flavor profile, even though the two are technically separate varieties.\nCascabels are medium-hot chiles, as well, and are known as bell chiles when fresh.",
            "Heat the chiles on the stove. Add the chiles to a separate dry, heavy saucepan. Toast them on medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until they become more fragrant and begin to look puffy or enlarged.\n\n\nFor an even stronger, hotter sauce, wait until the chiles begin to darken. This may take 6 to 8 minutes.",
            "Add broth and simmer. Pour the broth into the saucepan with the chiles. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the chiles simmer in the broth for 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\nThe broth should just barely be at a simmer. If you notice rapid bubbles forming as the chiles sit, you may need to turn the heat off completely for a few minutes before switching it back on to low.\nIf you do not have broth, use water instead.",
            "Seed the chiles. Remove the chiles from the broth using a slotted spoon. Transfer them to a cutting board and slice them into pieces, removing both the seeds and veins as you work.\n\n\nReserve the cooking liquid after you remove the chiles. You will still need it for the sauce.\nNote that if you want more heat in your birria sauce, you can actually leave the seeds and ribs. Simply cut out the tough stems and use the rest of the chiles as they are.\nUse food-grade gloves when handling the chiles. When the chile juices get onto your hands, they can cause mild burning and discomfort. Even worse, if you accidentally touch your eyes while the juices are on your hands, you can experience an extreme burning sensation in your eyes.",
            "Blend the chiles with the remaining sauce ingredients. Place the chopped chiles, cooking liquid, pepper, garlic, salt, tomatoes, onion, cloves, cumin, thyme, and apple cider vinegar in a large food processor. Process on medium to high speed until the entire mixture appears thick but smooth.\n\n\nIf necessary, you can add fresh broth or water to thin the sauce some if it appears too chunky or heavy. The sauce should be thick, but it definitely needs to be a sauce and not a paste.\nUse a blender if you do not have a food processor or if your food processor appears too small.",
            "Add the sauce and meat to the slow cooker. Place the browned meat in your slow cooker and pour the sauce over it.

    "wikiHow to Be a Dominatrix": {
        "intro": "A dominatrix takes the leadership role in a sensual or sexual relationship, and her partner (the sub or submissive) agrees to comply with all wishes and orders. Be a dominatrix by taking sexual control, respecting the boundaries of your partner, and trying new things. Make sure you always keep safety in mind and talk through all of your and your partner's wishes before engaging in BDSM play.",
        "steps": [
            "Never assume consent. Consent must be freely given. A person who is intoxicated or unconscious cannot consent. It’s best to check in from time to time to make sure. Of course, with BDSM it can be trickier to ensure consent, which is why it is important to set boundaries beforehand.[1]",
            "Set boundaries before playing the dominatrix. Talk to your partner about what’s off-limits, and what could be off-limits, depending on a number of factors, including pain, pressure, and psychological discomfort.[2][3] Using a “want/will/won’t” list can be helpful in determining how you and your sub’s desires align. A “want/will/won’t” list basically lists what you want, what you will do if asked, and what you won’t do.[4]\n\nCreating a “contract” can be a fun way to list wants, wills and won’ts. Though aren’t legally enforceable, they can begin a scene with the sub and set limits and boundaries within the fantasy itself.[5][6]",
            "Keep the lines of communication open throughout the experience. It is important to watch the body language of your partner. While it is often common in BDSM to play the role of ‘victim,’ you can usually tell the difference between BDSM play and a withdrawal of consent, especially if they are gagged. Look in their eyes, check to see if their body stiffens, or if they turn away. This is a sign they might not be enjoying the play. If any of this will be part of your play, establish this beforehand.[7]",
            "Determine a safe-word/gesture and a caution-word/gesture. To ensure consent throughout the play, determine both a safe-word and a safe-gesture, as well as a caution-word and a caution-gesture. The caution word/gesture will indicate that they are not sure or something might be wrong, whereas the safe-word would indicate a definite withdrawal of consent. Here are some tips for safe-words and caution-words.[8]\n\nExamples of safe-words and caution-words can be “stop” and “slow,” or “red” and “yellow.”\nThe gesture will depend on a number of things, including what body parts they can move, whether you can see their face, among other things. However, simple safe- and caution-gestures include blinking and nodding or shaking one’s head.",
            "Always have safety shears at arm’s reach. Sometimes ropes become knotted or move to more dangerous places during play. This is why it is essential to have safety shears on hand if you are using rope play. Even if you never end up using them, they should help your partner relax and be in the moment, rather than worrying about possible asphyxiation.[9]",
            "Keep water on hand. As with any strenuous exercise, staying hydrated is important. This is especially important if you or the sub is wearing heavy clothing or accessories (like leather).Water can also become part of the play, as you can tease your partner with the water before relinquishing the control of the water.[10]",
            "Take a class. Taking a class is a great way to familiarize yourself with all the intricacies of being a dominatrix. Because so many BDSM toys have the potential to do actual harm, taking a class on rope safety or being a dominatrix can help delineate safe practices when in the dungeon. Check to see if you local sex-shop offers a course. Just make sure it’s sex-positive and emphasizes safety and consent.[11]",
            "Choose an impact toy. An impact toy is used to hit the body, usually the buttocks, in BDSM play. Impact toys can include whips, canes, and paddles. The type will depend on your partner’s comfort level. There’s a whole range of products in this line from the traditional Indiana Jones-style whip to soft paddles.[12]",
            "Consider using a tickling implement. While people may not immediately consider tickling to be aligned with BDSM play, a tickler can be used similarly to a paddle, but imparting ticklish discomfort rather than direct pain. It can also be used to tease your partner when you slide it across erogenous zones like the neck or nipples.[13]",
            "Use pinchers or nipple clamps. Pinchers can be used to impart pain or pressure on the skin. Typically they are used on the nipples. For beginners, it’s best to set a ten-minute limit, as they cut off circulation to the nipple.[14]",
            "Use anal plugs and dildos. Plugs and dildos are great for all kinds of sexual play, but can be especially fun in BDSM play. When buying a dildo or plug make sure they are non-toxic, and that you have lube that is safe to use with them. You can use water-based lube with all toys and condoms. Oil based lubes are no good if you’re using condoms or if your using any latex, rubber or PVC toys. Silicone lube can’t be used with silicone toys.[15]\n\nVibrating dildos or plugs can add extra energy to your Dominatrix play.",
            "Choose a rope that is right for you. There are a broad range of color and materials available for bondage play. From nylon to silk, you can have varying levels of comfort, security, etc., with the varying types of rope. If you are unsure what type you want or need, talk to your local sex-shop.[16]",
            "Play safely with rope. Rope can be a dangerous tool in BDSM, as it can, if used improperly, cause nerve damage, asphyxiation, or even death. For instance, never press the rope against the front of your partner’s throat. Some things to consider when using rope play:[17]\n\nWhen someone is bound, you should never leave them by themselves.\nAvoid positions that make breathing difficult.\nMake sure the ropes are comfortable and allow for circulation. There should be at least a finger’s-width of room between the rope and your partner’s skin.",
            "Add cuffs to the play. There are cuffs for the wrists, legs, and even genitalia. They are a quicker way of restraining your partner than rope and can be safer depending on the type. They come in a lot of varieties from soft-velcro to locking metal handcuffs. Again, check with your partner to determine what type to use.[18]",
            "Choose a gag that fits your partner. There are a few different types of gags out there, and you should talk to your partner about the best fit for them. A ball gag can create an intense sense of vulnerability as it can impede breathing somewhat and stretches the jaw in a way the body isn’t used to. A bit gag is friendlier on the jaw and breathing. With any gag you choose, you should establish a safe-gesture or signal, so your partner can let you know they feel unsafe.[19]\n\nDon’t keep the gag on for longer than twenty minutes, especially if someone is new to gag play.",
            "Use a leash. A leash can be fun for the sense of control it offers to the dominatrix and the sense of being controlled it gives to the sub. In order to use a leash safely, don’t pull on it sharply. Make sure the collar is fitted properly, leaving two fingers’ width of room between the collar and the skin.[20]",
            "Choose a theme. Whether you’re imagining the eighteenth-century aristocratic sex dungeons of the Marquis de Sade or a futuristic sex lair, a theme can enliven the fantasy. While you may not want to change your entire bedroom for the theme, you can have props that help create the sense of fantasy you’re envisioning.[21]",
            "Wear clothing that shapes your dominatrix identity. This can include leather or brocade, a mask, a cloak, or really any thing that adds a sense of power or mystery to your play. You can work your outfit into your theme for the room or fantasy. You can choose an eighteenth-century vampire look or a steampunk goth look. It all depends on your fantasy and your identity as a dom.[22]",
            "Choose clothing for your sub. This can be part of the play, or you can decide together what your sub will wear during play. This can include hoods, straight jackets, and even chastity belts. Just make sure your sub is comfortable with the clothing and accessories before embarking on dominatrix play.[23]\n\nTry a blindfold. Keeping your partner in suspense is a tool you can use as a dominatrix. They will not see what is coming next. You can choose a soft silk blindfold or a leather one depending on your style. There are plenty of options available.[24]",
            "Add furniture to your dungeon. Sex furniture or particularly BDSM furniture can add an element of intrigue to your power plays as a dominatrix. From sex swings to cages, there all kinds of furniture for you to use in your dungeon or bedroom. You can use the furniture to tweak or enhance your theme.[25]",
            "Choose music for your fantasy. Whether Bach’s creepy Toccata in D Minor or something from Mozart the Rock Opera suits your fancy, you can add a layer of sensuality, power, or creepiness through the use of music. Music can enhance emotions and sensuality as you enact your fantasy. Avoid music that distracts, though.[26]",
            "Tell your partner when they can and cannot speak. This can be used in addition to or instead of gagging. Besides giving them permission to speak after they have had to be silent can be a way to evoke pleasure on both sides.[27]",
            "Tell them what to say. When you tell them what to say, you can do it in character (if you're acting out a fantasy), or even use words you've previously discussed. Either way the control can be helpful in building intensity. For instance, you can say, \"Tell me I'm your queen\" or \"Tell me exactly what you want.\"[28]",
            "Tell your partner what to do. This is often seen as traditional in a domme/sub relationship, but it can be definitely add to the power dynamic. Telling your partner to kiss you or touch you can create new understandings of both your sexualities. For instance, you can say, \"Kiss me on the lips.\" Just make sure you're not asking them to do something you know they wouldn't be comfortable with. If they use the safe word, stop the action or relinquish your request. That doesn't mean all play has to stop, just that you need to change tactics. Try offering up an alternative to your partner instead. You can say, \"If you don't want to kiss me on my lips, will you offer up a kiss on the cheek as an alternative?\"[29]",
            "Construct roles in a fantasy. Role play can be a creative and fun way to increase the tension of a scene. For instance you can play any role that has a power dynamic, such as queen and subject, boss and assistant, or anything else you can think of. Adding costumes can make the fantasy more real for you and your partner.[30]",
            "Implement punishments as part of the play. Sometimes, dominatrix will institute punishments for infractions on the part of the sub. These should be discussed thoroughly before a session, especially if you're new to BDSM. Ideally the punishments should really be fun for the sub. For instance you could use any of the impact toys as a way to punish your sub, or you can implement silence or an apology. In any case, it should not go beyond the sub's comfort zone.[31]"

            "Train your cat to use the scratching post outside. Your cat will always want to scratch on things, and if it doesn’t know how to use a scratching post, it will use your furniture instead. Before bringing your cat inside, place a scratching post in a dry spot, near your cat’s food. Give your cat at least a week to become accustomed to using a scratching post before bringing it inside.[1]",
            "Train your cat to use a litter box outside. Before bringing your cat indoors, place a little box outside in a dry location. Fill the litter box with fine-grain, clumping litter. Give your cat approximately a week to get accustomed to the litter box before bringing it inside.[2]\n\nMake sure to clean the litter box every day. Outdoor cats tend to like to use clean areas to eliminate waste. If the litter box is not clean, they are likely not to use it.\nPut the litter box in a safe and quiet area. Otherwise, the cat might be too scared or hesitant to use it.",
            "Take your cat to a veterinarian. Before bringing your cat indoors, you should be sure that it won’t be bringing disease with it. If your cat hasn’t already been microchipped, a process that allows it to be identified, your veterinarian should perform this procedure as well. A wild cat will also need to be vaccinated and neutered.[3]\n\nBefore the cat is spayed or neutered, the vet should perform a test for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV). FeLV is highly infectious between cats and can be deadly if untreated. The vet will do two blood tests to see if your cat has this disease.[4]\n\nThe vet should do a complete check-up of the cat. This includes checking for ear mites, fleas, lice, and other parasites. The cat should also be dewormed.",
            "Take it slow. Your cat isn’t likely to adapt immediately to living indoors. To prevent it from doing damage to your house, you should let it outside periodically, until it seems to be comfortable inside.[5]\n\nBegin by allowing your cat indoors for brief periods of time. Then keep it inside for progressively longer each time.",
            "Feed your cat indoors. While you might still allow your cat outside periodically, you should only give it food and water inside. This way, it will come to associate food with being inside. This will create positive associations with your home.[6]",
            "Give your cat two litter boxes. Place one litter box in a place that is convenient for you. Place the other near the door your cat takes to exit the house. This way, when your cat wants to go outdoors to use the restroom, it will see the litter box and use it instead. As your cat gets accustomed to the litter box, move the one near the door closer to the interior litter box. When the two litter boxes are next to each other, you can remove one.\n\n\nUse litter boxes that are large, but not very high. To encourage your cat to use the litter box, you should remove all obstacles. Thus, you should avoid boxes with tops or boxes that require your cat to jump up high to get inside of. [7]\n\nThe cat should feel secure when using the litter box. Place the litter box in a quiet area of the house where other animals and humans won't bother it too much.",

Some cats are resistant to walking on a leash but if you can leash train your cat you will both find it to be a rewarding experience. [8]",
            "Buy toys for your home. Your cat will feel less of a need to break out to hunt, if it has plenty of opportunities to express its hunter’s instincts inside. You should have several balls, fake mice, and other toys for your cat to play with. Most importantly, you should play with your cat to give it something exciting to do in your home.[9]\n\nIf you roll a ball along the floor, your cat might chase it and swat at it.\nTry getting a toy mouse attached to a stick. Drag the mouse on the floor or dangle it over your cat’s head. Your cat should try to attack it.\nCats also like feather toys. These are often feathers that are attached to the end of a string or a stick. Drag them on the ground or dangle them in the air.\nTry rotating new toys into the home every couple of weeks to keep your cat interested.",
            "Buy catnip. Many cats enjoy the smell of this herb. Buy some and place it in strategic spots where your cat likes to spend time or where you would like it to spend time. Placing it on a scratching post, for example, can encourage it to begin sharpening its nails on the post, instead of your furniture.[10]",
            "Get a cat tree. Cats enjoy looking down on humans and jumping to high lookout spots. At the pet store, you can buy “cat trees” with multiple platforms for your cat to jump on and climb around.[11]\n\nCat trees can be expensive. Alternatively, you can clear off some shelves or arrange your desks and bookshelves so that your cat has nice perches to jump to.",
            "Give your cat a warm place to sleep. A warm, comfy cat bed can be a great way to entice a cat indoors during cold and rainy months. If you don’t want to buy a special cat bed, try to arrange some blankets on your bed or couch in an inviting way. If your cat finds a spot that it seems to like, set the space aside for it.[12]",

    "wikiHow to Felt a Pool Table": {
        "intro": "Replacing the felt, or more accurately the pool tablecloth, is often left to professionals, but the tools used are not expensive or complicated. The reason some consider it difficult is the exacting requirements of a pool table. A stretch in the wrong direction, or a little dust left on the table can make your final playing surface bumpy or unpredictable. You can minimize the chance of this happening by working slowly and carefully, and finding an assistant to stretch the cloth as you fasten it.",
        "steps": [
            "Begin disassembling the pool table. Remove the pocket liners from each pocket first, if any are present. Next, find the bolts on the underside of the table keeping the railings in place, and remove them. Move the railing carefully to a safe storage space where it won't get scuffed or damaged, or interfere with your movement around the pool table.\n\n\nThe railing may be composed of one, two, or four pieces.[1] If the railing does not divide into four pieces, you will likely need an assistant to transport it safely.\nSome pool table pockets are bolted or screwed on separately from the railings.",
            "Remove the old felt. Felt can be attached in more than one way. Use a staple remover if the felt is stapled to the table. If it is glued, you can simply rip the felt off, but be careful not to damage any felt in the pockets unless you also plan on replacing those portions as well.[2]",
            "Level the table (optional). You may wish to use a level to test whether your billiards table is flat. If it is not, use a small pry bar to lift the lowest leg and add a wooden or metal shim.",
            "Clean the slate. Use a dry, clean cloth to remove dust. Do not use any water or cleaning solutions. If old glue or other residue has built up, scrape this off with a putty knife or other flat blade, especially where it may block pockets.[3]",
            "Seal the seams with beeswax if necessary. Most pool tables are constructed from three pieces of slate. On an old pool table, the seams between these may have lost some of the wax that fills them in to create a flat surface. If the wax needs replenishing, heat the slate around the seams with a propane hand torch, then drip wax into these seams. Spread the wax evenly across the seam line, let it cool for no more than thirty seconds, then scrape excess wax down to the level of the table surface using a paint scraper.[4] It's better to remove too much wax than too little, since excess wax can be difficult to remove once dry.\n\nIf your pool table is kept in a warm location, you may wish to use putty specifically formulated for pool tables. There is a great deal of disagreement over which of these synthetic products produces the best quality table, so you may wish to consult a local expert familiar with your climate.",
            "Measure your pool table before purchasing felt. Measuring will take the guesswork out of sizing your felt, resulting in a faster process and a cleaner result. When you purchase the felt, or more technically the pool tablecloth, for your table, make sure it is at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) longer than the table on all four sides. This ensures that you will have plenty of cloth for the railings as well as the table surface.\n\n\nNote that pool felt is actually a special type of cloth, and while it is commonly referred to as \"felt,\" it is usually sold as \"pool tablecloth,\" \"pool cloth,\" or \"billiards cloth.\" You cannot use ordinary felt to cover your pool table.\nWoolen pool cloth is the pool felt most players are familiar with. Worsted cloth allows for greater speed, but is rarely used outside of professional tournaments due to its lessened durability and price. Other varieties such as snooker cloth, carom, or polyester cloth are only suitable for certain uses.[5]",
            "Use this method if there is a wooden or particle board backing. Many tables have a wooden or particle board layer beneath the slate, allowing staples to be attached. You can check whether this is true of your table by examining the perimeter or vertical edge of your table. If there is only slate, use the instructions for gluing the felt instead.\n\n\n\nNote: You will need a \"hammer tacker\" or manual stapler, or a staple gun.",

Follow these instructions carefully, or the cut pieces may not fit your table.\n\n\nWith some felt, you can make a one inch (2.5 cm) cut, then rip the felt by hand in a straight line.[6] Other felt may require cutting with a razor blade or box cutter.",
            "Roll the felt out face up over table. Look for a sticker or other label that tells you which side is face up. If it is unlabeled, and you cannot easily tell which side is the playing surface, consult a professional. Different types of felt have a different feel, so it's best not to guess if you are not familiar with the feel of that type.\n\nHang more of the extra felt over the foot end, and not much on the head end where you will begin installation.\nCheck now for rips, scratches, or other defects that could require you to get a refund or replacement.",
            "Stretch the felt across the head end and staple it on the vertical edge in several places. Use your hammer tacker or staple gun to attach the felt to the wooden or particle board lining of the table at one corner of the head end. Have an assistant help you stretch the felt across the head end until there are no wrinkles present, keeping the overhang parallel with the table edge. Staple about every 3 inches (7.5 cm) along this stretched edge, ending at the second corner.\n\nProfessionals play on a very tightly stretched surface, which allows for greater speed. This is not necessarily desirable for most players, however, who may enjoy playing on a slower table.[7] Always stretch at least tightly enough to remove all wrinkles, however.",
            "Repeat the process on the left side. Move to one of the long sides of the table, and have an assistant help you pull the felt taut along its length. Staple at roughly 3 inch (7.5 cm) increments, but make sure to staple on either side of the side pocket.\n\nPulling the felt over each pocket when stapling on either side will give you extra material to work with when lining the pockets.",
            "Staple on the foot end, then the right side. Pull the felt tight from the last unstapled corner. Pay special attention to this, as an inconsistent pull can cause wrinkles in your table. If the previous staples make it impossible to create a flat surface with this pull, with the overhang parallel with the table end, you may need to remove a couple staples with a staple puller and try again. Once this is pulled to a smooth surface with the desired tightness, staple the short foot end and remaining right sides along their lengths.[8][9]\n\nRemember to staple on each side of the side pocket.",
            "Trim the material at the pockets and staple it inside. Make three slits in the felt directly over each pocket, then fold the loose felt down into the pocket and staple it inside the pocket. Once this is done, use a pair of scissors or a razor blade to snip off the excess felt.",
            "Use specialized spray adhesive if the table cannot be stapled. If your table has no wooden or particle board backing underneath the slate surface, you'll need to find a specialized adhesive to glue the felt to the slate instead. If you do see that backing, follow the instructions for stapling the felt instead.\n\n\n3M Super 77 Multipurpose Adhesive is a popular option.",
            "Cover the sides of the table with newspaper. Protect the edges of the table from spilled glue with a layer of newspaper, overhanging the edge.[10] Remove newspaper from each edge just before you lower the glued felt.",
            "Cut the felt according to the manufacturer's instructions. Felt usually comes in one large pieces, along with instructions for cutting off strips for each railing. Follow these instructions to ensure you end up with pieces of the correct size.",
            "Identify the playing surface and place the felt over the table. If the \"face up\" surface is not labeled, try to identify it by feel or consult a professional. Your felt playing surface may be smooth, or it may have a \"nap\" in one direction, depending on the type; you may need to have an expert identify the face-up side if you are not familiar with the material. Arrange the felt over the table, leaving only a couple inches (a few centimeters) of overhand on the short head end. Make sure each overhang is as parallel to the table edge as possible.",
            "Fold the head end of the felt up and apply glue. Fold the head end of the felt over onto the table, exposing the underside that will hang over the vertical side of the slate. Spray that portion of the underside heavily with the adhesive, and spray the slate where it will be attached as well.[11] Let this sit until it becomes tacky, according to the adhesive manufacturer's instructions.",
            "Carefully attach the felt to the table. Starting at one end, align the glued felt carefully with the slate, press down, then move along the glued end, pulling tightly as you attach it to the table. You may need an assistant to ensure the material is taut, especially at the beginning of the process.\n\n\nThe felt should be tight enough to prevent all wrinkles, but an ultra-tight surface is not necessary unless you want to practice for professional tournaments.[12] Most importantly, you should pull the felt with the same pressure throughout this installation.",
            "Repeat the process with the far end and the long sides. The gluing process is identical for each of the remaining three sides. Wait at least a couple minutes between each side, or however long the adhesive manufacturer recommends to create a strong initial bond. Carefully pull each side taut before you apply glue, making sure there are no wrinkles on the cloth and you are pulling with the same force on every side.",
            "Trim the felt, and use the excess to line the pockets. Trim the excess felt overhang on each side. One one side, cut a one inch (2.5 cm) wide strip of material for use as pocket liner. Cut off the material stretched over the pockets, then cut this strip into smaller pieces, gluing them over the vertical, circular surface of the slate to protect it from the pool balls.",
            "Remove old felt from rails. Use a staple puller or flathead screwdriver to remove the staples from the ends of the rails. Cut the old felt along the top of the rail if it does not come off immediately.[13]",
            "Gently remove the wooden feather strip. Each rail has a thin wooden \"featherstrip\" running alongside it, which is typically not attached by any adhesive or nails. If it won't come up easily, Use a thin flathead screwdriver to pry it up without breaking it.",
            "Place a new strip of felt over the rail. Unlike the table top, this felt should be \"face side\" down. Keep an overhang of at least 4 inches (10 cm) on each end, and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) over the feather strip groove.[14]",
            "Use a tapping block and hammer to wedge in the center of the featherstrip. Lay the featherstrip back in position, but do not press it down. Have an assistant stretch the felt tightly between the center and one end of the railing. Place a tapping block over the featherstrip, then use a hammer to gently tap the block, pushing the featherstrip down into the stretched portion of the felt, but stop about 2 inches (5 cm) from the end, where the corner pocket will be located.[15] Stretch the other half of the felt, and repeat this process for the remaining length of the featherstrip, again stopping 2 inches (5 cm) away from the other end.\n\n\nDo not strike the featherstrip directly, or you may dent the table.",
            "Pull felt toward the cushion and tap in the ends of featherstrip. Pull the felt at the ends of the table toward the rubber cushion, then tap in the remaining portion of the featherstrip until it is firmly in place. Trim and fold the felt as necessary to remove excess material and cover the ends of the cushion.",
            "Reassemble the outer rails. Once all your rails are complete, bolt them to the table again. If you're having a hard time finding where the bolts should go, you can push a screwdriver through the bolt holes as guidance. Never try to cut holes in the playing surface from the top of the table, as you may cut in the wrong place."

            "Decide on a budget. Especially if you are having this as a birthday party, you need to confirm with your parents/guardians how much money you are going to spend. Remember to check in a few different stores before buying decorations and food; you may find somewhere that sells stuff for a much cheaper price.",
            "Choose a theme (optional). You might want to have food - like cake - and decorations all linked to the same idea. Here is my favourite theme idea:Disney - You can watch a Disney movie, get some cheap Minnie and Mickey Mouse decorations, put on the Frozen soundtrack CD*1 or Now that's what I call Disney CD*2 and dance along, dress up as Disney characters and maybe even plead for a Disney cake!*1: £10.99 in Disney Store/£7.00 in Claires. *2: £12.59 from base.com",
            "Choose who to invite. As you're girls (unless if you couldn't read 'For young girls' bit at the top), I suggest inviting only girls to the sleepover - it can get out of hand if boys come. Also, don't invite anyone who you don't get on with because if you fall out, it's unlikely that her parents will get out of bed to fetch her!",
            "Decide how to invite your chosen friends. The most original method is to use paper invitations which you can buy or make yourself. If you have a theme, try to find or make invites that somehow link to the theme you have chosen.",
            "Food and decorations. Depending on your budget, it's a good idea to choose food that everyone enjoys. Pizza is a great choice: if you're tight on cash, you can buy a pack of pizza bases from somewhere like Tesco and find enough ingredients around your house to customize your own pizzas, you could order Domino's if there is enough money or, if you're prepared to splash the cash a bit, you could try taking your friends out to a restaurant. Now onto decorations. Poundland and 99p Store are great places to go if you want to liven up your house but your budget is low, but party pieces and party delights have a wide range of themed decorations if you are ready to give more than £1.",
            "Get yourself ready. Wash yourself and put on some favourite clothes. You want to look your best!",

    "wikiHow to Be Selfless": {
        "intro": "Selflessness means putting your community's needs above your own instead of always acting in your own interest. Acting selflessly isn't easy, but the more you practice the better you'll get at being kind and generous more often. When you make a habit of taking action to help others feel good and make the world a better place, you'll see that being selfless can actually make you happier.",
        "steps": [
            "Broaden your perspective. Being selfless starts with having the ability to see beyond your personal concerns and empathize with others, even those you've never met. If you're constantly consumed by your own problems and status, you won't have time or energy to act selflessly. Having greater awareness of the world outside your head is the first step to becoming more selfless. Here are some ways you can get some perspective:\n\n\nListen when other people are talking. Really listen, instead of letting your mind wander when someone is confiding to you about his or her troubles, or telling you an exciting story. Allow yourself to get completely absorbed in someone else's world for a change.\nRead, watch, or listen to the news. Make it a point to be aware of major world events as well as happenings in your own city.\nRead novels. Studies show that reading literary fiction improves your ability to be empathetic.[1]\n\nPick some issues to learn more about. Look around you. What central issues are affecting your community? For example, maybe the river in your town is so polluted that it's causing people to get sick. Pick something you want to learn more about, then read as much about it as possible so you'll gain a deeper understanding.",
            "Think about how other people feel. Empathy and selflessness go hand in hand. If you understand how someone else feels, you'll be more likely to be moved to act selflessly toward that person. You can have empathy toward people you've never met, too.\n\n\nPractice imagining yourself in other people's situations. If you were the one experiencing the problem, how would you feel? How would you want to be treated?",
            "Be selfless even when no one notices. Selfless people don't act with kindness and generosity with the expectation of getting credited for it. They do it because it's the right thing to do, and because it feels good to help other people when you have the capacity to do so. Donating something anonymously is a good way to practice being generous without needing to get something in return.",
            "Take pleasure in other people's happiness. Have you ever experienced a rush of joy when you made someone else happy? Some people wonder whether it's possible to be truly selfless, since the act of selflessness can actually bring great pleasure. Rather than focusing on whether selflessness is, in fact, selfish, relish the good feelings that come with helping other people. If you take pleasure in other people's happiness, you'll be more likely to find extra ways to be selfless.",
            "Model yourself after someone who is selfless. Being selfless isn't always pleasurable. Putting other people's needs before your own is usually worth it in the end, but it's often extremely difficult to act in someone else's interest when you have your own needs to attend to. That's why having selfless role models can be a great help.\n\n\nThink of a person whom you would describe as \"selfless\" - someone you know, a celebrity, a religious figure - anyone who tends to act for the benefit of others. What selfless actions has he or she taken? What impact did the actions have?\nNext time you are struggling to make a selfless choice, ask yourself what that person would do, and try to find strength in the answer.",
            "Don't hurt someone else for your own benefit. Whether it's something as seemingly insignificant as taking the biggest helping of cake and leaving none left for your sister, or a more impactful decision like devising a way to get the attention of your best friend's boyfriend, never hurt someone else to get ahead. Doing this often enough will backfire on you. Seek out the selfless choice, even when it's also the hardest.\n\n\nResist the temptation to cheat, steal, or pull the wool over someone's eyes, even when you're sure you won't get caught.",
            "Don't value your time more than other people's. Are you the type who gets impatient when you have to wait in line at the post office or grocery store? When you start feeling your blood pressure rise, remember that every other person in the room has a life just as valuable as yours. Their time is as precious to them as yours is to you. Keeping this in mind will help you act selflessly when impatience threatens to get the better of you.\n\n\nDon't take out your problems on other people. Having a lousy day doesn't give you the right to make someone else suffer for it.",
            "Choose the option that helps the most people. Constantly putting your own friends or family's desires above the needs of the greater community isn't truly selfless. How can you best meet the needs of as many people as possible, rather than just helping out those closest to you? Be a good example to those around you and go for the option that's best for everyone.",
            "Forgive and forget. If someone crossed you and seeks forgiveness, do your best not to hold a grudge. The selfless approach is to try to see the situation from the other person's point of view, and realize that it's almost always better to foster peace, love and forgiveness than spitefulness and hate. Forgiving someone who has wronged you can be incredibly difficult, but it's also exquisitely selfless.",
            "Volunteer your time and skills. This is one of the most rewarding ways to practice selflessness. When you volunteer your time and skills, all you get in return is the rewarding sense that you've played a part in helping your community. Studies show that volunteering may actually boost happiness and longevity.[2] There are endless ways to volunteer, so identify a need and determine how you can contribute.\n\n\nHomeless shelters, soup kitchens, and other nonprofit organizations to help those in need are always seeking volunteers.\nIf you have a specific skill you'd like to use, look for an opportunity to work with an organization that could use your help. For example, if you're a skilled teacher, you could teach literacy classes at your local library.\nSites like volunteermatch.com provide information on opportunities in many communities.",
            "Donate what you can. Donating money and goods is another great selfless act that you should practice as frequently as you're able. This is not to say you should donate more than you can afford. Take a look at your budget and decide how much you can give, then commit to donating that amount, even if it means sacrificing a few extras.\n\n\nConsider picking out a few charities to which you regularly donate a specific sum.\nMaking a practice of donating to those who ask for change is a kind, selfless act you can do on a daily basis.\nDonating food, clothing, and other material goods to homeless shelters, disaster relief organizations, animal shelters, and so on is another great way to give back.",
            "Be there for your friends and family. We all have days when we'd like to turn off our phones and retreat from the world. However, doing this too often means you can't be a stable presence for your friends and family when they need your help. Find ways to be responsive and helpful to those close to you who rely on you in times of need.",
            "Be selfless in everyday ways. Give up your seat on the train to the elderly and pregnant. Hold doors open for people coming in behind you. Pick up the tab when you notice the person at the next table is short on cash. It's impossible to be completely selfless all the time - you can't pay for everyone's meals or give everyone in need the shirt off your back - but try to find several meaningful ways to be selfless on a daily basis.",
            "Remember to take care of yourself. Being selfless can take an emotional toll if you don't take time to restore your energy. If you find yourself constantly catering to other people's needs and saying \"yes\" when you could really use a break, you might need to take a step back and focus on yourself for awhile. If you aren't physically and emotionally healthy, you won't be strong enough to \"be there\" for other people, so be sure to take good care of yourself.\n\n\nYou are just as important as everyone else is. Respect yourself and your own needs just as you respect other people's."

    "wikiHow to Run a 4X100 Relay": {
        "intro": "The 4 x 100 relay, also called the 400-meter relay, is a sprint relay with four runners. Each runner runs approximately 100 meters before handing off a baton to the next runner. Before running the 4 x 100 relay, make sure that you and your teammates are experienced with sprint running and have practiced the baton exchange. This will help you to decide the order of your team, and ensure that you run your best race possible!",
        "steps": [
            "Place your best starter first. The ideal first runner has an explosive takeoff and never gets disqualified for false starts. This position also requires fast running around the bend of the oval track.[1]",
            "Choose the second runner. The second runner should perfect their baton handling skills, as the second leg involves both receiving and passing the baton. This is a straight leg, so this is a good spot for a fast sprinter who is not really good at bends/curves.[2]\n\nThis is a great spot for your fastest runner if they are much faster than the other three.[3] This is especially true if your fastest runner is also great at baton handoffs.",
            "Pick a good bend runner for the third leg. In general, shorter runners are best around curves because they can accelerate faster than taller runners. This position also benefits from good baton handoff skills, and from the ability to compete under the pressure.[4]\n\nAlthough unorthodox, it could be smart to put your fastest runner here if they are also good on bends. A 200m specialist could do well on this leg.[5]",
            "End with an eager finisher. Many teams place their fastest runner last, perhaps so they can claim the glory! In fact, psychology may be more important than raw speed. This runner cannot get discouraged if they start the fourth leg behind the other teams. Choose a competitor who thrives under end of race pressure.[6]\n\nIf your two fastest runners are much faster than the other two, place them second and fourth. This allows you to maximize the distance they run.[7]\n\nAt high levels of competition, choose a runner with advanced finishing techniques.[8] This includes \"lifting,\" a running form with light ground contact and rapid knee lifts, and lunging, a carefully timed forward fall so the chest crosses the finish line sooner.[9][10]",
            "Adjust for smooth handoffs. All of your planning above will fall apart if an athlete can't perform consistent baton handoffs. Consider these problems before you finalize the positions, and don't hesitate to rearrange if issues arise during practice:\n\n\nSize differences: If one runner is much taller than another, they may have trouble exchanging batons smoothly. Space them out so they don’t have to do a baton exchange.[11]\n\nIf a pair of athletes do not practice well together for temperamental reasons, and the coach cannot solve this problem, consider rearranging so they don't have a handoff together.\nIf one athlete is particularly poor at passing, consider placing them fourth. If an athlete is poor at receiving, consider putting them first.",
            "Pick the baton exchange method. There are generally three methods of passing the baton: the upsweep, the down sweep, and the push pass. Try all three and see which your teammates prefer:[12]\n\nUpsweep: the outgoing runner runs with their hand behind them at hip level, palm down and thumb outstretched to form a V shape. The incoming runner inserts the baton upward between the thumb and fingers.\nDownsweep: similar to the upsweep, but the outgoing runner's hand is palm up and receives the baton in a downward motion.\nPush pass: the outgoing runner holds their arm high up behind them, with the palm sideways and the thumb pointing down. The incoming runner holds the baton vertically and pushes it into the palm.",
            "Stay on the correct side of the lane. When all goes well, the relay race is a smooth series of transfers, with no awkward jerks across the lane or switching from an athlete's left hand to the right. Practice this pattern until all four runners find it automatic:[13]\n\nFirst runner holds baton in right hand and runs on the inside edge of the lane.\nSecond runner holds baton in left hand and stays on the outside.\nThird runner holds baton in right hand and stays on the inside.\nFourth runner holds baton in left hand and receives on the outside.",
            "Decide where to relay the baton. Each baton handoff must occur inside a 20-meter changeover zone, between two yellow marks. The outgoing runner can start running up to 10 meters ahead of the changeover zone, but can only receive the baton within the zone. Use tactics as well as trial and error to find an exchange position that maximizes speed and smooth handoffs:\n\n\nIdeally, you can exchange the baton about 5 meters from the end of the zone.[14] This gives the outgoing runner more time to accelerate before receiving.[15]\n\nIf the athletes have trouble with a quick handoff, or if they get nervous and slow down while waiting, exchange the baton just past the middle of the zone.[16]\n\nIf one athlete is significantly faster than the others, they can receive earlier in the zone, carrying the baton for more than 100 meters.",
            "Keep running after you release the baton. A huge mistake in relay racing is to slow down before you release the baton. The best way to prevent this is to form the habit of \"running through the zone.\" Keep up a full sprint until you're about halfway through the next leg.[17] If both runners have positioned themselves well (on opposite sides of the lane), the incoming runner should be able to run close behind without fearing a collision.",
            "Do speed drills. The 4x100 is all about speed. To prepare for the race, do drills such as hill sprints, suicides, and sprinting around comes to work on your agility and speed. Hill sprints are especially good for improving acceleration.[18]",
            "Practice the whole race. You don’t want the first time you run the race to be at the track meet or event. Run the event several times at least, at full speed. Have a coach or friend who is knowledgeable about running time each of your attempts. Also, have your friend or coach watch each runner and offer any critiques that they might have.[19]",
            "Position each runner. After doing warm ups, make sure that every runner is in position. The first runner should be positioned on the starting blocks, holding the baton in his or her right hand.[20]\n\nThe second runner should be positioned at the acceleration zone 10 meters before the first exchange zone. Each exchange zone is marked on most tracks by large, usually red, triangles. There should be a smaller triangle that marks the acceleration zone, which is where the second runner should be positioned.\nThe third runner should be at the second acceleration zone before the exchange zone, and the fourth runner should be at the last acceleration zone.",
            "Start at the whistle. As soon as the whistle is blown, the first runner should start sprinting. Make sure that they lean in and accelerate through the bend in the track. They will run slightly more than 100 meters to the first exchange zone.\n\n\nMake sure that the runner runs on the inside of their lane, on the left-hand side, so that they can pass the baton to the next runner’s left hand.",
            "Do the first baton exchange. The first runner, with the baton in their right hand, will approach the exchange zone. The second runner should have their head turned, watching the incoming runner. When the incoming runner is about 7 meters from the outgoing runner, the outgoing runner should turn their head back and start running with their hand out. The first runner will hand the baton over to the second runner, who will take the baton in their left hand if the first runner hold it at his/her right hand.[21]\n\nMake sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone because your team will be disqualified if it happens before or after the zone.",
            "Do the second baton exchange. The second runner will a straight leg of the track for another 100 meters. Make sure they are running on the right side of their lane. Meanwhile, the third runner will start running as soon as the second runner approaches the exchange zone. The second runner will pass the baton from his or her left hand into the right hand of the third runner.\n\n\nAgain, be sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone.",
            "Do the final exchange. The third runner will run around the bend on the track, the baton in their right hand. As they approach the last exchange zone, the fourth runner will start running with their hand out, and the incoming runner will put the baton in their left hand, making sure the exchange happens within the exchange zone.[22]",
            "Finish the race. The fourth runner, with the baton in their left hand, will run another 100 meters past the exchange zone to finish the race.

[1] You will have control over the number of hours that you work and will be able to decide which clients you take on. If you own your own business, you will also get to decide who to hire as your employees and how to brand your business to the community. With some time, money, and preparation, you can have a successful career running a maid service.",
        "steps": [
            "Decide if you want to run your own business. Owning a maid service requires much more thought and planning than just buying some cleaning supplies. Designing a business plan will help you think of all the different steps you should take to build a strong foundation for your business.\n\n\nIf you have other major demands on your time -- such as caring for a sick relative or going to school part time -- you might want to consider if this is the best time to start your own business.\nAlthough the cleaning industry generally has low start-up costs, you will still need a minimum of $5,000 to purchase equipment and insurance, hire a lawyer to protect your legal interests, and get an accountant to run your payroll division and sort out your taxes.[2]",
            "Define your budget. One the key components of your business plan is your budget, or the amount of money you have to invest in your business. This will often determine the scope of your business plan, how many employees you plan to take on, etc. Do you have the money to spend on the massive amount of cleaning products that a large office building will require or are you intending to work out of a smaller, private home?\n\n\nYour budget may also help determine if you will join a cleaning franchise (like Molly Maids, Merry Maids or Vanguard Cleaning Systems). Franchises often require expensive joining fees (usually between $30,000-$50,000), but they also help cover some structural needs like marketing, employee training, support for franchise owners, etc.[3]",
            "Write down your Unique Selling Point. It is likely that you won't be the only maid service available in your area. What do you offer that no one else does? Why should your clients pick you over your competitors?[4]\n\nFor example, will you offer eco-friendly cleaning supplies? Will you offer carpet or rug cleaning services? Do you offer hours on the weekends or evenings?\nWrite down three or four words that will define the core values of your brand. What three words do you want your customers to remember when they think of you? Some key words might be loyalty, trust, care, reliability, spotless, pristine, etc.",
            "Define a customer service plan. So much of the cleaning industry is based on customer service. If your clients don't trust you, they won't feel comfortable allowing you into their homes.[5]\n\nConsider special incentives you can offer to your most loyal clients. You could start a referral program where your clients get 10% off if they refer your services to a friend or family member.[6]",
            "Set your price. Your price should be competitive enough that you won't lose potential clients, but high enough that you can still make a profit.[7]\n\nCharge by the hour. Some cleaning services change by the hour. The national average for house cleaners is $14/hour, but cleaners in large cities average prices between $18-20/hour. You might find this is the best route to go when you have new clients and don't know how long it will take to complete a project.[8]\n\nCharge by the room or square footage. You might also consider charging by the physical amount of space in the home or office. If you have a very large home to cover (like a vacation home that needs to be prepared after months of being unoccupied), this might be the smartest method to choose.\nSet a flat rate. Many cleaning services also just set one flat rate for each visit, especially if they clean the house more than once a month. If you clean weekly, or even multiple times a week, you will find that charging a flat rate will be more effective than charging by the hour. However, if you only clean for the client once a month or less frequently, then you will have more work to do.[9]\n\nYou should factor in other things to your fee, such as the cost of transportation to different clients' homes and the cost of repurchasing cleaning supplies and appliances like vacuums or carpet cleaners.\nYou should also have a clear billing system in place. If you are working through a franchise like Merry Maids, it is likely they will have a system put into place already. But if you are working independently you should decide if you are going to have an invoice system where you send your customer a bill, if you will accept checks or credit cards on the spot, or if you will take payment at the beginning or end of the month.[10]",
            "Hire high-quality staff. The cleaning industry has a very high turnover rate -- an average of 300%.[11]. Although it might initially be more expensive to hire staff with lots of experience and great recommendations, investing in your employees and giving them favorable working conditions will mean you will save money in the long run.\n\n\nTalk to your lawyer about the legal categorizations of workers. In most industries, you are not allowed to legally take on part time, contract workers when they actually complete the essential work of your business.[12]",
            "Market your business. If you have worked in the cleaning industry previously, you might already have a loyal following of customers who can use word of mouth to market your new business. But if you don't, there are number of other routes you can take:\n\n\nCreate brochures that you can leave in high-traffic areas, like community centers, gyms, churches and other places where your potential clients meet.\nOutreach to potential clients through a Facebook page, Twitter or other social media page. You could use these to feature \"Before\" and \"After\" pictures of your work, promote special deals, or create content relating to your business.\nMarket yourself locally. Join the listservs of different neighborhood associations or websites like Nextdoor to advertise your services.\nSome websites like Handy and Homejoy function as a space where you can list your services through their web site directly (like AirBnB). However, some of these websites have been shown to charge very high rates to their customers, but not give the same wages to their maids while also not allowing their maids to list their services on other web sites. Use caution when listing on these sites -- you might make more money on your own.[13]\n\nIn all of your promotional materials -- like brochures, flyers, web site design, business cards, etc. -- use a consistent logo and color palette. You want to position your business as a brand experience, where your customers get a consistently superior service.\nYou can also consider having your employees wear a particular uniform, such as slacks and a polo shirt with your company's logo on it.",
            "Seek out your target market. Your target market is your core demographic of clients. Do you want to work at the homes of busy working parents who don't have extra time to clean? Or do you want to help clients who are elderly and are incapable of cleaning for themselves? Establishing a key target market will help you specify your marketing campaigns?[14]\n\nLook for unmet needs in your local cleaning market. Perhaps there aren't many cleaners who offer environmentally friendly products. If this is the case, position yourself as filling a void for your clients.",
            "Hire an accountant and a lawyer. An accountant can give you great advice on how to grow your business financially and a lawyer can keep your legal interests protected as your business grows. They will also be able to advise you if you should turn your business into an LLC or an S Corporation.[15]\n\nIf you are an S Corporation you can still be an employee (or cleaner) and get the benefits of begin on payroll while you are also the owner of the business. If you are an LLC, you cannot do this.[16]",
            "Get CIMS certified. The Cleaning Industry Management Standard certificate is generally not required to expand your business, but you will find that it gives you much more credibility within your profession.[17]\n\nTo get certified, you will need to pay a $500 application fee and a certification ($995 if you are already a member of CIMS, $1695 if you are nonmember). A CIMS assessor will then visit your business to inspect your cleaning processes to make sure they fit their standards. The price for this is $1500 for each assessment date required.",
            "Expand your business. As you grow and gain more income, consider expanding your business into other cities in your state. If you have upper-level members of your staff, you can consider making them responsible for another branch of your business.[18]\n\nMake sure you keep your insurance as you take on more workers. If your employees are working with harsh chemicals, then you should make sure you have liability insurance and also offer worker's compensation for your employees.[19]"

    "wikiHow to Fight With Your Partner So You Both Win": {
        "intro": "All couples belong to what can be called The Fight Club because, they all fight. Couples that don’t fight are the ones that therapists worry most about. In fact, couples who do not fight have double the divorce rate of those who do. Loving couples do air their differences. But they follow three certain rules to make sure that their disagreement does not turn into World War III with mutually assured destruction.",
        "steps": [
            "Make sure anger and criticism do not take over. Anger and criticism lead to “flooding,” a stress explosion in which the heart beats more rapidly, blood pressure soars and adrenaline surges. The whole body tenses up as fear, confusion and then more anger take over. Flooding actually triggers the fight or flight response, and when you can't run you fight. Reason goes out the window. In experimental studies of conflict, even when couples are asked to calm down, men simply aren’t able to while women can. Biologically speaking, men are wired to react more quickly and for a longer time period, probably for vigilance and safety reasons. So that’s why it’s best to start an interaction that could become a fight in a soft, sweet, or affectionate way with Positive Shaping Talk, also known as Non-Violent Communication. While a man can often be triggered by mere criticism, it usually takes contempt or strong denigration to flood a woman. Loving couples tend to avoid flooding and practice Positive Shaping Talk with each other. They keep anger levels down, and learn to choose words carefully. And if anger swirls out of control they may use breathing, time out, humor or other Fight Club Rules to defuse the situation.",
            "Agree to disagree. A healthy couple agrees to disagree, discussing differences with respect and self control. They often show each other that they understand the other’s point of view. The partners realize that ultimately they both want the same thing: closeness and a sense of shared love. If they feel heard and understood, like their opinion matters, they can often let go of the issue, back down and reenter into an intimate connection. In loving couples, who is right and who is wrong matters much less. In fact, these couples operate out of a fundamental paradox: “I accept you as you are,” on the one hand and on the other, “Now will you please change.” This paradox is so well known, that it became the title of a long-running Off-Broadway show written by a long-term couple called, I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change.",
            "End conflict in a win-win way. There are several ways you can help end conflict on a positive note. Use the “Take Two” technique. Either of them is able to call out “Take Two” when a fight erupted and they would start their “scene” all over again, but from a loving place with the right to establish rules. Couples do this naturally when one of them says something like, “Can we talk about this in a different way?” Or perhaps one partner affectionately teases or soothes the other who is in the midst of flooding and the fight is over then and there. Or they might compromise. The couple may follow a rule, such as: don’t let the sun rise on your wrath. Of course, one key to ending a fight is that a partner realizes they are wrong, apologizes and/or makes it up to their beloved.\nIn general healthy couples fight, but their fighting is less out of control and ends on a sweet note that carries them back to laughter, closeness and intimacy. If, for example, Gina, describes how she uses Fight Club Rules with her husband: \"He gets so wounded and growls a lot if he thinks I am criticizing him.\" She says that she brings stuff up when they are lying in bed, feeling close, with their feet touching. It’s funny, but doing it this way means we fight a whole lot less.",
            "Remember, practice doing whatever it takes to come out of your anger and create a dialogue. In the midst of a disagreement, take a break, breathe, soothe or calm yourself and try on the other person’s point of view. Ask yourself honestly, do you need to back down or make an apology to your partner? When you are fighting, which is more important, being right, or being close? And if your spouse gets flooded with anger, practice using humor, giving them space or soothing them in some way so that they can calm down."

    "wikiHow to End a Codependent Relationship": {
        "intro": "A codependent relationship can manifest in many ways: you may feed into your partner’s alcoholism or be a people pleaser who’s afraid to say no. The codependency may revolve around drugs or substances, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, chronic pain, or a mental illness.[1] Codependent relationships occur when one person gives love through giving assistance while the other person feels love by receiving the assistance.[2] While this exchange may feel good for a time, it is not designed to last, and at some point, one person will be unhappy. Often, the best solution for a codependent relationship is to end it.",
        "steps": [
            "Recognize your choices. You may feel as if you do not have choices in this relationship. However, you do have the freedom to love someone because you choose to and not through dependency. You have the freedom to leave a destructive or harmful relationship.[3] Recognize your ability to choose what you want and what serves you best.\n\n\nThe relationship may feel like it is serving the other person much more than it is serving you. Is it your responsibility to take care of this person? Think about what options you have, and that the other person is capable of making choices, too.",
            "Be firm in leaving. Often, codependent people may become so engrossed in someone else’s care that they neglect their own needs and become out of touch with their own desires, wants, and needs.[4] If you’re ready to end the relationship, be firm in your assertion to end the relationship, and know that this decision is what you want and need. Before going into a discussion, remind yourself that you are firm in your decision and are not open to renegotiating the relationship or giving it “another shot.”\n\n\nChances are, you’ve probably already given this person “just one more chance” without much changing.\nIf you end the codependent relationship yet the person is still in your life (like a parent or sibling), be firm in enforcing your boundaries.\nBe firm, even when the person pleads with you to stay. Say, “I’ve given this a lot of thought and I am sure of my decision. I am not willing to waver on my decision.”",
            "Have a talk. Ending a codependent relationship may be difficult just to walk away from and may require a discussion. The other person may feel confused if the dynamics of the relationship suddenly change and their needs are no longer being met in the same way without explanation. Choose a time when there are no interruptions, and open the discussion.\n\n\nYou can say, “I’ve noticed that the way we interact isn’t healthy. I’m realizing how little I take care of myself. It’s important for me to keep boundaries, and that means ending this relationship with you.”",
            "Act calmly. The other person may not take your decision well. He or she may react in anger, rage, upset, hurt, or sadness. Even if the person threatens you, remain calm in your demeanor. Don’t raise your voice, yell, or swear. If the person is yelling, respond with a soft and gentle voice. It’s likely the person will mirror your behaviors.[5]\n\nIf the person starts to accuse you, say, “I’m not willing to talk about things from the past or get into an argument with you. I’m letting you know how I feel and that I am leaving.”\nFor more information, check out How to Calm an Angry Person.",
            "Express your feelings. It’s up to you how much you wish to discuss with the person. You may wish to say, “I cannot go on with this relationship” or you may wish to elaborate and say what is not working for you. When talking about your feelings, keep the focus on you and avoid blaming the other person. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.[6]\n\nFor example, “I” statement keep the focus on you and not on blaming the other person. Instead of saying, “You take all of my attention and you wear me out” say, “I’ve put myself in this position and find myself tired all the time. This isn’t good for me.”",
            "Set limits. Ending some codependent relationships may mean completely walking away, while others may end a codependent relationship in favor of a healthy relationship, such as family relationships. You may feel entirely responsible for the action of others. Or, you may feel like you have to go over and above your share of the responsibilities.[7] Start to set limits on what you are willing and unwilling to do.\n\n\nFor example, If your brother is hungover and wants you to call his work with an excuse, say to him, “It was not my decision to drink last night. This is a consequence you have to deal with on your own.”\nif you need to study for a test and a friend calls you to talk about her problems, say, “I care about you and want to support you, however, it’s important for me to study for my exam tomorrow. Why don’t we check in tomorrow?”\nIf you want to set specific boundaries, let the person know. Say, “We may have to work some things out, but I’m unwilling to meet with you face to face. I want to limit our communication to texts.”\nFor more information, check out How to Stop Being a People Pleaser.",
            "Think about what the relationship fulfilled for you. While you may feel like you put in a lot of effort to this relationship-- including caretaking roles-- it’s likely you’ve also gained from this relationship. If you did not find some fulfillment in the relationship, you probably would have ended the relationship much sooner. Consider how this relationship has served you and why it no longer serves you.\n\n\nFor example, you may have felt like you had a sense of purpose by taking care of someone who was an alcoholic or that had a major medical condition. You may love the feeling of “being needed” or being in control.[8]",
            "Work through feelings of abandonment. People in codependent relationships tend to have a fear of abandonment. This can be one reason they choose a helping role in a relationship: taking care of someone and having someone depend on them means this person won’t likely abandon them. If you have a fear of people leaving you, see a therapist. Therapy can help you work through feelings of abandonment, explore ways to care for yourself, and trust others.[9]\n\nOften, abandonment issues start in childhood or with a traumatic event. It’s beneficial to work through these issues in order to help you free yourself from the fear of abandonment.",
            "Validate your own self-worth. Chances are, you find at least part of your self-worth in caretaking. Instead of relying on helping others to validate you, learn to validate yourself without needing others to validate you.[10] You may feel as if you need others to tell you how important you are, but you can do this on your own.\n\n\nAs you think about ending the codependent relationship, reflect on where you derive your sense of self-worth. How do you perceive yourself? What are your own thoughts about who you are and what you deserve? Do other people seem more able to attain success or happiness than you?[11]\n\nIf you’re not sure where you stand with your self-esteem, take an online test.[12]",
            "Meet your own needs. You may be so caught up in meeting someone else’s needs that you neglect your own needs. While it may feel like the person depends on you, recognize what is within your own responsibility. It’s likely that by devoting your time, attention, and resources on this person, you’ve neglected taking care of yourself. You may feel like you have no idea who you are outside of taking care of this person, or that your full identity is taking care of someone.[13]\n\nStart to regain a sense of what your own needs are. For instance, do you need alone time to recharge after a stressful day? What do you do to cope with stress? Have you neglected your nutritional or exercise needs? What about sleep?",
            "Create physical distance. Spend less time with the person and don’t clear your schedule to take care of the person’s needs. If you live with the person you are in a codependent relationship with, move out. Living together may exacerbate the need to caretake for the person. Moving out can create physical distance between the two of you, which can help decrease the need to caretake. Help create emotional and physical space between the two of you by spending less time together.\n\n\nYou can also create emotional distance from this person. Gently let the person know that you are not willing to respond to texts, emails, or phone calls. Say, “I want this relationship to be complete. I don’t want this to be confusing and I think we both need time to process. For that reason, I don’t plan to respond to texts, phone calls, or emails.”",
            "Process your feelings. Don’t stuff your feelings down, or tell yourself that everyone is just fine. Instead, process how you feel and pay attention to your feelings. Reflect on the relationship and your sense of identity after it.[14] Identify and process each emotion that comes up and don’t ignore how you feel.\n\n\nYou may choose to process your feelings through a journal, by talking to a friend, or by seeing a therapist.",
            "Accept your grief. Undoubtedly, it will be difficult to end the codependent relationship. Accept that it will be hard and may hurt. Don’t repress your grief, which may lead to depression. Instead, accept it and allow yourself to feel it. Grief can include feelings of disbelief, anger, fear, and sadness. Other symptoms of grief may include feeling tired, tense, empty, or having changes in sleep or eating habits.[15]\n\nAllow grief to run its course. Let go of what may have been and accept what is.\nOne way to work through grief is by observing your body. The more you think, the less connected you are to your emotional experience. When experiencing emotions, pay attention to how it feels in your body. Where do you feel it, and what kind of sensation do you feel? Let the bodily sensations and the emotions move through you.",
            "Seek social support. It can be difficult to separate yourself from a codependent relationship. Have someone to talk to about ending the relationship who will support you. Reach out for emotional support by talking to a friend or family member. A trusted friend can help guide you through making tough decisions, then support you as you follow through with difficult choices.[16]\n\nFor more information, check out How to Build a Social Network.",
            "Go to therapy. If you find it difficult to process the end of the relationship on your own, a therapist may be helpful. Therapy can help you address your thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors and discover what is beneficial and what is hurting you. Therapy can help you increase your self-awareness and your coping skills.[17]\n\nA therapist’s role is to challenge and support you.

Independent contractors have more freedom to determine their own schedules than employees, but are liable for health insurance and paying self-employment taxes.\n\n\nHighly skilled professionals such as accountants and engineers are often independent contractors. So are skilled laborers such as truckers, construction workers, and art models.[3]",
            "Use what you have. There are myriad ways to work for yourself using the skills and resources you already have. Become a dog-walker, a junk-hauler, a bicycle-delivery person, a freelance writer, a babysitter or a web developer. If you are looking to start your business quickly, take stock of your skillset and go from there.\n\n\nWork for an App. One quick way to get a job as an independent contractor is to sign up with a rapidly-expanding company with minimum requirements for hiring. Airbnb hosts and Uber drivers are independent contractors.[4]",

        "steps": [
            "Look for eye contact. If a girl looks down when she first sees you, or if she lowers her head while smiling, it’s a strong indicator that she’s attracted to you. It can be hard to look someone in the eye when you have strong feelings that are not yet exposed.\n\n\nTriangulation describes a pattern of eye movement that is a strong indicator that a girl is into you. She will look at one eye, then the other, then your mouth, and then repeat the sequence.[1]",

            "Pay attention to body language. If a girl leans in close to you, makes an excuse to touch you, or lets each tough linger for a longer period of time, then she may see you as more than a friend.[3]\n\nIf she touches your shoulder, brushes your hand, or hugs you for no real reason, it is a positive indication she likes you.\nIf a girl wants to share a drink or food with you, chances are she is way into you.[4]",
            "Notice if she laughs at your jokes, even when they are not funny. If a girl has a big smile every time you two have a conversation, and laughs nonstop, then she thoroughly enjoys your company. This is an unconscious way of saying, “I really like you, and I love listening to you talk\".[5]\n\nWhen in love, you see that person through rose-colored glasses, making everything that person says seem perfect and funny.",
            "Pay attention to how she treats you in comparison with other guy friends. If she likes you, she'll probably act more shy or blush a lot when you are around. If she treats you the same as other guy friends, chances are she just wants to be friends.",
            "Observe her behavior when you are in a group. If a girl likes you, she may give you tons of attention, even if she is around other people. This is because you are the one she prefers talking to and spending time with.[6]",

            "Ask a mutual friend how she feels. Girls tell their friends almost everything. If you are too nervous to directly ask a girl if she has feelings for you, casually ask a friend she is close to.

Here are casual questions you can ask:\n\n\n\"Do you know if she like anyone?\"\n\"Does she ever talk about dating?\"",

        "intro": "In order for a product to claim that it is “100% whole wheat,” it must only contain whole grains and provide consumers with a full serving of whole wheat per one recommended serving size. When you shop for 100% whole wheat products, don’t be fooled by misleading claims, colors, and appearances. Instead, always thoroughly investigate the bread’s packaging before you purchase a loaf—look for the Whole Grains Council’s stamp of approval and always read the label and ingredient list carefully.",
        "steps": [
            "Look for the “100% Whole Grain” Stamp. In 2005, the Whole Grains Council began to release products that contained a “100% Whole Grain” stamp. The stamp allows consumers to identify whole grain products quickly and reliably. If a product contains this stamp, the consumer can rest assured that the product:\n\n\nContains at least a full serving of whole grain per recommended serving size.\nContains only whole wheat.\nProducts that carry the “Whole Grain” stamp must contain at least half a serving of whole grain per recommended serving size.[1]",
            "Understand the term \"whole grain.\" Whole wheat is just one type of whole grain. While searching for whole wheat bread, you may come across products labeled \"Whole Grain.\" These breads may contain whole wheat, a different type of whole grain, or a combination of several whole grains.[2] Read the label to determine if the product is made from 100% Whole Wheat.\n\n\nA whole grain contains all three parts of the kernel: the bran (outer layers), the germ (part that generates new plant growth), and the endosperm (inner layers).[3]\n\nOther types of whole grains include brown rice, oats and or oatmeal, and wheat berries.[4]",
            "Remain skeptical of products that may contain whole grains. As grain kernels are processed, parts of the grain are removed. If the label does not include the word “whole” in front of a grain, the entire kernel may not be present in the product. When you shop for whole wheat bread, remain wary of products with the following words on their labels:\n\n\nWheat or wheat flour\nSemolina (purified endosperm of durum wheat common in pastas and cereals)[5]\n\nDurum wheat (dense wheat commonly used in pastas and cereals)[6]\n\nOrganic flour\nStoneground\nMultigrain (this term indicates that the product contains multiple types of whole grains ‘’’and/or’’’refined grains.[7]",
            "Avoid products that list parts of the grain as ingredients. Throughout the refinement process, the three parts of the wheat kernel are separated. Each part of the kernel is repurposed and sold as its own product. Avoid products that list parts of the kernel on its labels. These terms include:\n\n\nEnriched flour: when wheat flour is refined into white flour, the bran and germ are stripped away, leaving only the endosperm.\nBran: this is the outer layer of the kernel.\nWheat germ: this is the part of the kernel responsible for new plant growth.[8]",
            "Look for products that list whole wheat as the first ingredient. Food companies must list their ingredients in descending order of weight. The most prevalent ingredient is always the first item listed. If you are searching for a 100% whole wheat product, the first ingredient listed should be “Whole Wheat Flour,” “100% Whole Wheat Flour,” or “Wholemeal Flour.” No other type of flour should appear in the ingredient list.\n\n\nWheat flour, unbleached wheat flour, multigrain, enriched, and stone-ground wheat flour are alternative ways of saying “refined white flour.”[9]",
            "Be skeptical of products that list whole wheat second. If whole wheat is the second item on the ingredient list, there is a high chance that whole grains account for a majority of the ingredients. However, this is not always the case. When whole wheat is listed second on the ingredient list, the bread may contain between 1% to 49% of the grain.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, always choose a product that lists whole wheat first.[10]",
            "Note the length of the ingredient list. The only ingredients required to bake delicious bread are flour, water, yeast, salt, and a pinch of sugar. Bread manufacturers add additional ingredients to their bread to enhance their product’s taste, texture, and shelf-life. If you are trying to purchase less-processed bread, shop for items that have a short ingredient list with identifiable ingredients.[11]",
            "Do not buy bread based on its color. A common misconception regarding bread is that the color of the loaf is directly related to the nutritional value of the product—the darker the loaf, the healthier the bread. This is not always the case, however. Always read the ingredient list to determine if a product is truly nutritious and made of whole wheat or if it simply contains artificial coloring agents.\n\n\nMany dark loaves, such as pumpernickel and rye, are often made with enriched flours and receive their dark hues from molasses or caramel.\nWhite bread is not always unhealthy. Many manufacturers are now producing white breads made from white whole wheat flours.[12]",
            "Do not buy bread based on descriptive words. Bread companies use certain phrases to make consumers believe that their product is more nutritious than it truly is. These phrases often include the following words: “country,” “home,” and “harvest.” Since these phrases are not regulated by the FDA, bread companies may deceptively depict the production process.\n\n\nDon’t let these words prevent you from scanning the ingredient list.[13]",
            "Do not assume that multigrain bread is made with whole grains. Multigrain sounds incredibly nutritious, but the term’s vagueness makes it rather deceptive. A multigrain product does not necessarily contain a variety of whole grains.

    "wikiHow to Unclog a Slow Shower Drain": {
        "intro": "When you notice the water in your shower or bathtub is not flowing down your drain easily, you might be tempted to call the plumber. Slow drains are caused by clogs created by soap buildup, hair, and other gunk blocking the drain. However, you don't need to call the plumber right away, as you do have options available to you to address slow shower drains before you wrack up a plumber bill.",
        "steps": [
            "Remove the stopper from the drain. Most drains are easy enough to unclog with either your hand, a wire, or clothes hanger. However, you first need to figure out how to release the stopper. Most drains are either drop stoppers or push/lock drain stoppers.[1]\n\nTo release a drop stopper, first lift it up slightly. It should have screw that sticks up a little. Simply turn the screw a bit to make it looser, then lift the stopper up.\nFor the push/lock drain stopper, first push down once like you are going to stop up the drain. Push it again to unlock it. Once it is unlocked, you should be able to unscrew the whole stopper and then pull it out.\nIn a shower, you may need to just lift up the strainer at the bottom. You may also need to unscrew the grating.",
            "Create the tool you need. While you can remove some clogs with your hand, it will be easier, more effective, and less disgusting to use a tool. You can start with either a wire coat hanger or a piece of stiff wire, but you need to do a bit of preparation either way.[2]\n\nFor the coat hanger, straighten it out into a long wire. Bend the end of it with pliers so it makes a smaller hook that will fit down your drain.\nFor the wire, just bend the end in a little hook to catch the hair.",
            "Remove the clog from the drain. With the bent wire, hook the clogged hair by shoving it through the clog. Use it to pull up the clog out of the drain, then throw the hair away. You may need to dip down more than once to get all the hair.[3]\n\nIf the hair is particularly stubborn, you may need to use a utility knife to cut it.\nAs you pull the hair up, slice through the middle so you don't need to untangle it.",
            "Put the stopper back in. Once you are sure all the hair is gone, check to see if the shower is draining properly again. If it is, put the stopper back in the drain. You'll need to screw the whole push/lock stopper back into place, while for the drop stopper, you'll just need to screw in the middle shaft.[4] If it's not draining properly, you'll need to move on to other options.",
            "Using a chemical drain cleaner. Products like gel cleaners and other types of commercial drain cleaners can help you remove clogs from your drain. However, you do need to be careful with these products, as they are very strong, and they can damage your pipes or cause problems if you don't use them properly.[5]\n\nAlways read the bottle to make sure the product you have can be used on the types of pipes you have and the system you have. For instance, you may need a special product for a septic system. In addition, make sure you buy one appropriate for baths and showers.\nNever mix more than one type of drain cleaner. For instance, if the clog doesn't move, you don't want to pour another kind on top. That can lead to toxic fumes, which can cause you health problems.",
            "Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Each drain cleaner will work a little bit differently, so it's important to read the instructions first. Make sure you are following the instructions to the letter because drain cleaners are powerful chemicals and they can be harmful.[6]",
            "Start with what you need. Generally, you start with about half a bottle to try to remove the clog, and then you wait a specified period, usually about 15 minutes. Use the whole bottle if it's not draining at all and half if it's draining a little bit. Usually, you can pour the cleaner through standing water but not always.[7]",
            "Run hot water down the drain afterwards. After waiting the required time, you need to use hot water to clear the chemicals and the clog. Watch to see if it's draining properly. If it's not, you may need to try again with some more of the same drain cleaner. Make sure you don't try a different cleaner.[8]",
            "Use an enzyme detergent. Pour 1 cup of Dawn liquid dish detergent, or any enzyme-based liquid dish soap, into your shower drain. Let it sit for at least an hour and then flush the drain with hot water from the tap.[9]\n\nThis solution can create a large amount of suds, so be careful.",
            "Try hot water. One natural solution that will get some slow drains unclogged is boiling water. If the water is still standing in your shower, let it drain out. Boil some water, and then slowly pour it down the drain, which will help move some minor blockages along.[10]\n\nIf you have regular PVC pipes, boiling water could damage the pipes. However, if you have metal or CPVC pipes (which can take higher temperatures), using boiling water should be fine.\nHowever, according to most city codes, you should have metal or CVPC, not PVC.",
            "Try vinegar, baking soda, and hot water. Another option for a natural solution is vinegar, baking soda, and hot water. These ingredients can help break up the clog when used in conjunction with each other, though you may not want to mix these solutions with chemical clog cleaners.[11]\n\nStart by pouring a single cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by 2 cups of boiling water. Once you've given that about five minutes, follow it up with a baking soda-vinegar combo.\nPour a cup of baking soda down the drain. With the stopper ready to go in, pour in a cup of vinegar. Stop up the drain, and let the baking soda and vinegar foam together. Once it's done, pour another cup of boiling water down the drain.\nOnce again, make sure you have CPVC or metal pipes, as boiling water may damage regular PVC pipes. Nonetheless, most houses built to code should have pipes that can withstand boiling water.",
            "Help unclog the drain with a toilet plunger. Tape over any overflow holes with duct tape, so you can get a better seal. Put water into the tub to cover the bottom of the plunger. If there is already standing water that is draining slowly, you can use that instead of adding more water. Place the plunger over the drain and plunge the drain a few times, moving it up and down, much like you would in the toilet.[12]\n\nYou may want to get a plunger specifically for this purpose so it will be cleaner. However, since you'll likely be cleaning out your shower when you're done, putting a dirty plunger in there won't be the end of the world.",
            "Try a drain stick first. A drain stick, such as a Zip-it, is a mini snake that can be used to remove clogs. Once you have the stopper removed, you stick the end of the stick down the drain. The barbs catch on any clogs, and you can pull them out. However, the stick is only about a foot long, so it won't work on clogs further down.[13]",
            "Buy or rent a snake. A snake, also known as an auger cable or sewer rod, is used to find clogs further down. It's a cable that has a tip on the end to pick up clogs. You can buy or rent one at your local home improvement store to use on your drain.[14]",
            "Push the cable in. On a shower, remove the strainer part. On a tub drain, take off the overflow plate and go through that hole. Start threading the cable or rod into the hole. Keep going until you feel the line hit a clog, then stop pushing.[15]",
            "Latch on to the clog. With an auger cable, latch on to it by turning the handle clockwise. That twists the end into the clog. Keep pushing, pulling, and turning to get rid of the clog. With a sewer rod, push forward and back to break up the clog.[16]",
            "Make sure it is clear. If the standing water starts draining, that's a good sign the line is starting to clear. Keep working at the clog until it feels completely gone, and run some more water down it to make sure that it is draining properly and that there's not a clog further down the line.[17]\n\nIf there's a clog further down the line, you may need to feed in more rod or cable to clear that clog out.",
            "Pull out the rod or cable. Once you're sure the line is clear, wind the rod or cable out of the pipe. Run some hot water down the pipe to ensure you are completely clear, and then replace anything that needs replacing, including the shower drain. Wind up the pipe and return it to the store or put it away.[18]",
            "Take measures to prevent buildup in drains. Use strainers to minimize the chance of hair entering the drain. These strainers just fit over the drain and catch hair before it goes down to where you can't get it as easily. You can purchase strainers from a hardware store near you.[19]\n\nHowever, you do need to clean out these strainers regularly to keep your shower draining properly.",
            "Flush your drain with hot water. Run hot water down your drain every time you use the shower or bath. This process will allow fresh build-up to be washed away, reducing the chances of prolonged buildup sticking to your pipes.[20]",
            "Use baking soda regularly. You can also use a baking soda flush once or month or so. Simply start by dumping a cup of baking soda down your drain. Follow that with a cup of boiling water. Doing so can help keep clogs from building up.[21]"

    "wikiHow to Make a Simple Electric Generator": {
        "intro": "Electric generators are devices that use alternating magnetic fields to create a current through a wire circuit. While full scale models can be complex and expensive to build, you can create a simple electric generator easily. All you need to do is create a simple frame to hold the wire and magnet, wind the wire, connect it to an electrical device, and glue the magnet onto a spinning shaft. This even works well to teach electromagnetic properties, or display as a science project.",
        "steps": [
            "Cut the cardboard. Cardboard will serve as the frame and support for your simple generator. Use a ruler to measure a cardboard strip that is 8 centimetres (3.1 in) by 30.4 centimetres (12.0 in). Cut this strip out with scissors or a utility knife. This single piece will be folded to form the frame.[1]",
            "Mark the cardboard. Use a ruler to measure along the length of the cardboard. Make your first mark at 8 centimetres (3.1 in). Your second mark should be at 11.5 centimetres (4.5 in), and your third mark should be at 19.5 centimetres (7.7 in). The final mark will be at 22.7 centimetres (8.9 in).[2]\n\nThis creates segments of 8 centimetres (3.1 in), 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in), 8 centimetres (3.1 in), 3.2 centimetres (1.3 in), and 7.7 centimetres (3.0 in). Do not cut these segments.",
            "Fold the cardboard. Fold the cardboard along each mark. This will make your flat piece of cardboard into a rectangular frame. This frame will house the components of your electric motor.[3]",
            "Slide the metal shaft through the support frame. Push a nail through the center of the cardboard frame. Make sure you go through all three pieces of cardboard that are folded into the center. This will create the hole for your shaft. You can now insert a metal shaft, or use the nail as your shaft.[4]\n\nThe metal shaft does not have to be anything in particular. Any piece of metal that will fit through the hole and come all the way out the other side of the frame is acceptable. The nail you use to make the hole will work perfectly.",
            "Wind the copper wire. Make several turns around the cardboard box with enamel coated copper wire (#30 magnet wire). Wind 200 feet (61 m) of wire as tight as you can. Leave about 16 to 18 inches (40.6 to 45.7 cm) of wire loose on each end to connect to your meter, light bulb, or other electronic device. The more \"turns\" or winds you make around the cardboard frame, the more power your generator should produce.[5]",
            "Strip the ends of the wire. Use a knife or a wire stripper to remove the insulation from each end of the wire. Remove about 2.54 centimetres (1.00 in) of insulation from each side. This will allow you to connect the wire to an electronic device.[6]",
            "Connect the wires to an electronic device. Attach the two wires you have loose at the ends of the windings to a red LED, #49 miniature bulb, or a 1.5V grain-of-wheat lamp. Or, connect the test leads from an AC voltmeter or multimeter to them. Keep in mind that you are producing a very low voltage, and larger devices (e.g. a regular light bulb) will not be powered by this generator.[7]",
            "Glue the magnets to the shaft. Use a high strength hot melt glue or epoxy to glue four ceramic magnets to the shaft. You want the magnet to be stationary with respect to the shaft. The magnets should be glued onto the shaft after the shaft has been inserted into the frame. Allow the glue to dry for several minutes (the instructions on the container can tell you exact drying times for your type of glue).[8]\n\nFor best results, use 1x2x5 cm ceramic magnets (these can be found online for a reasonable price). Glue them so that two magnets are facing the coil with their north side, and two are facing the coil with their south side.",
            "Turn the shaft with your fingers. This allows you to see if the ends of the magnets hit the inside of the frame. The magnets must turn freely, but as close as possible to the walls of the frame. Again, having the magnet's ends as close the copper wire windings as possible will increase the \"exciting\" action of the magnetic fields the magnet produces.[9]",
            "Spin the shaft as fast as possible. You may want to wind a string around the end of the shaft, then pull it sharply to turn the magnets. You could even just spin it with your fingers. As the shaft turns, you should get a small voltage (enough to light a 1.5 volt light bulb).[10]\n\nYou could improve the power output by putting a pinwheel on the end of the shaft and connecting it to an electric fan to turn the wheel. Keep in mind that this is only good to demonstrate the operation of the generator since you use more electricity turning it than you create."

    "wikiHow to Understand Your Rabbit": {
        "intro": "We've all seen images of cute and cuddly rabbits that are friendly and outgoing, but rabbits are actually quite misunderstood. Rabbits are a prey species, which means they're constantly on alert for danger and easily scared. As a rabbit owner, it's important for you to understand your pet's behavior, body language, and sounds. This will help you create a relationship based on awareness and understanding.",
        "steps": [
            "Listen to the sounds your rabbit makes. Realize that your rabbit will probably be silent most of the time. As a prey species, rabbits have learned to be quiet in order to escape the notice of predators.[1] Some rabbits do make an occasional noise, either when very happy, scared, or as a warning.\n\n\nThis makes them very different from purring cats and dogs which use a whole vocal range to communicate.",
            "Keep an ear out for pleasure sounds. Rabbits have a limited repertoire of noises they make when they're happy. These include a very quiet purr, a soft clicking noise, and a very quiet grinding of the teeth noise, which means she is content.[2]\n\nThese can be very quiet, so you'll need to pay close attention in order to hear the sounds. Your rabbit may softly grind her teeth or click while you're petting her in her favorite spot, like behind the ears or under the chin.\nBe aware teeth grinding can be a sign of distress, but in this case the noise is louder.",
            "Listen for warning noises. The classic warning signal is a thump with a back leg to warn other members of the group of danger. A rabbit that feels threatened and is angry enough to attack may make a series of grunting or growling sounds. Likewise loud teeth-grinding is another warning sound of annoyance. Some rabbits, faced with a threat, will hiss.[3]\n\nIf you have two rabbits (one male and one female) and the male starts grunting, move him immediately, unless you are attempting to breed them. A grunting male is a sure sign that he is attempting to mate or breed with the female.",
            "Respond quickly to sounds of fright. Rabbits have a particularly penetrating and distressing scream. They reserve this for when they are extremely frightened or actually being attacked. If your rabbit screams, she may be in danger or pain.[4]\n\nIf you notice your rabbit in pain, check for signs of obvious external injury and contact your rabbit's veterinarian immediately. Your rabbit may have a life threatening injury or internal issue that needs to be addressed right away.\nHowever, a rabbit's instinct as a prey species means when they are hurt they are most likely to hide or stay very still to avoid attracting attention, so do not rely on noise alone to alert you to discomfort.",
            "Notice signs of relaxation. Much of a rabbit's body language is subtle and understated, but you may see him relax. A relaxed rabbit may lie on his belly with his back legs stretched out behind him. He may also squat with all legs tucked beneath him and his ears softly held against his head.[5]\n\nA rabbit's ears are early warning radars for danger, so ears in a neutral position indicate relaxation.",
            "Recognize submissive gestures. Your rabbit might try to make himself as small as possible, pulling his head and neck into his body and generally trying to disappear. He'll also avoid making direct eye contact with the rabbit (or person) he is submitting to.[6]\n\nA submissive rabbit is usually signalling to other rabbits in the warren that he is no threat.",
            "Calm a frightened rabbit. If frightened, your rabbit will press his ears hard against his head (trying to reduce his silhouette so a predator doesn't spot him) and his facial muscles will appear taut and tense. This has the effect of making his eyes appear to pop out of his head.[7]\n\nThis is similar to a submissive rabbit, trying to make himself as small as possible.",
            "Make adjustments as necessary if your rabbit shows signs of irritation or dislike. Your rabbit will rapidly shake his head from side to side. He will also thump a hind paw against the ground to make a drumming sound.[8] If really irritated, he may even lunge at another rabbit or you.",
            "Learn to see signs of happiness or contentment. These are fun actions to look for. Your rabbit may perform binkies, or happy hops and twists in the air. Your rabbit may also run around your feet, showing that he's thoroughly enjoying life. He may also move his jaw as if chewing. All of these actions show that your rabbit is enjoying freedom of movement and is happy.\n\n\nIf your rabbit isn't neutered, running around your feet may also indicate that your rabbit thinks you are an acceptable mate.\nYour rabbit might also lick your hands and face while he is being petted. This may be a sign that you are very special to him. He may even rub his chin on you, thereby marking you as its territory by leaving its scent.",
            "Respond to requests for attention. Your rabbit will give you plenty of clues that he needs your attention. These include: lightly nudging you with his nose, tugging on your clothes, climbing up your leg, hopping onto your lap, or nipping at your ankles. If your bunny nips at your ankles for attention, you can train him to stop by walking out of the room whenever he or she does this. Reward more polite behavior by petting him, talking to him, or giving him treats.\n\n\nYour rabbit might also make a noise that sounds like a goose honking. This signals that he's annoyed or wants attention. If your bunny is not neutered, he may make this sound when being amorous towards you or a soft toy.\nIf your rabbit hops a few steps away, remains with its back to you, isn't occupied with anything else, and occasionally turns its head to see if you are still watching it, it is offended at something you've done. You can apologize by feeding him a treat, or giving a couple of pets on the head. You can also repeat this act to your rabbit if it does something to offend you. It will most likely come by to apologize, either with a few kisses or quick bumps.",
            "Watch for bathroom signs. Your rabbit may eat his droppings. There is no need for you to be concerned if your bunny does this. It's natural and should not be discouraged. You may also see your rabbit pushing out his bottom and tail before urinating.\n\n\nRabbits need to digest some foods twice and they take these droppings directly from their bottoms. He might make a low pitched squeak when he does this.",
            "Realize that rabbits are a prey species. You can think of a rabbit as a 'listener' rather than a 'talker' because their lives are tuned to being on alert for danger. They use a highly developed sense of smell (hence the constant nose twitching), hearing (those wonderful long ears), and prominent eyes to watch for threats.\n\n\nThis means it is even more important that you understand your rabbit, so you know what she does and doesn't like. This can minimize her stress.",
            "Read your rabbit's subtle signals. Nature intended rabbits to live underground in tunnels during the day, emerging at dusk and dawn (when it's more difficult for predator's eyes to spot them) to graze on grass and plants. Because they spend the majority of their time in the dark, rabbits make limited use of visual signals, such as nuanced facial expressions or body language.[9]",
            "Avoid picking up your rabbit, unless she likes it. Being picked up by a human can be a terrifying experience to some pet rabbits who go into a catatonic state, where the rabbit lies absolutely still, eyes open and staring, and does a good impression of being dead.[10]\n\nRabbits are ground dwelling animals. In the wild, the only time they leave the ground is when they're picked up by a predator.",
            "Respect if your rabbit doesn't want to be handled. If that's the case, she will either scrabble, wriggle, and fight so hard you get scratched, or she will go completely still. Far from indicating she appreciates being cuddled, a rabbit that keeps deathly still in your arms is actually pretending to be dead in order to make the predator (you!) give her up as a bad meal and put her back down.[11]\n\nIf your rabbit reacts in this way to being picked up, sit on the ground and encourage her to sit on your lap. This way her paws are in contact with a horizontal surface and she can learn to associate you with safety, rather than an instinctively alien and scary experience.\nIf it's essential to pick the rabbit up, place a towel over her eyes, and use the rest of the towel to scoop her up. The darkness will help calm her.",
            "Avoid handling a rabbit that's biting or scratching. An aggressive rabbit has learnt to bite and scratch in order to avoid being picked up. Be aware that your rabbit is doing this out of fear and unease around humans.[12]\n\nGradually gain your rabbit's trust. Don't try forcing your rabbit to cuddle or sit in your lap.",
            "Provide plenty of hiding places for your rabbit. Hiding can decrease his stress levels, so he may feel comforted knowing that he has lots of places to hide. This will also make your rabbit feel more secure.[13]",
            "Start keeping your rabbit company. At first, do not attempt to handle him, but offer treats (dandelions!) so that he associates tasty foods with human company. Sit down beside the hutch every day, talking in a soothing voice and giving treats, so he learns humans are no threat.[14]\n\nYou can offer several kinds of fruits to your rabbit, such as grapes, apples, blueberries, and raspberries. Be sure to only give a very small amount, like a single grape or a couple of raspberries.[15]",
            "Begin interacting gradually. As your rabbit starts to venture out of his hiding place for treats, try to touch him briefly while he eats a treat. As the days and weeks go by, increase the amount of time you touch him until he's comfortable. Then you can try to entice him onto your lap (seated on the ground of course). This is also a great way of gaining a timid, frightened rabbit's trust.[16]"

When you hear the voice in your head say something negative, take a pause and substitute the negative for something positive.\n\n\nFor example, if your mind keeps saying how much you hate your principal, you can say, “This is a tough job and he’s doing the best he can.”",
            "Keep a gratitude journal. Record instances that occur in your life that you are grateful for. Express them in a journal, letter, or other kind of writing. Write down some of the things that you’re thankful for. Write in this journal a couple of times every week.\n\n\nResearch shows that a gratitude journal is more effective when the person writes about a handful of instances in depth, rather than a laundry list. Spend a few minutes reliving and savoring these moments that you write about.[2]\n\nThe gratitude journal will help you remember the positive things in your life.",
            "Practice positive imagery. Imagine yourself in successful scenarios with as much detail as possible.[3] Keep the negative thoughts like “I can’t do this” at bay. Instead, focus on how you can do something: “I can finish this project. I will ask for a little help and it will get done.”\n\n\nWhen you strive to be confident in your activities and outlook, you will increase your potential for actually achieving your goals.",
            "Find the positive side of life’s challenges. Keep moving forward and don’t focus on how difficult life can be. Think of the adventures you’re having in life because of these challenges. If things were straight and smooth, your life might be pretty uninteresting. Think about the ways you’ve overcome challenges and become a better person because of them.[4]\n\nFor example, if you’re mad that you were laid off, think about how you have been able to spend valuable time with your children.",
            "Alter your reactions to life’s frustrations. We can often feel like we’re surrounded by life’s frustrations. Perhaps you lost weight and gained it back, or it rained at your neighborhood barbecue. When we get bogged down by frustrating events, we start to notice and get frustrated by minor things, like not finding a parking spot or hitting all the red lights in traffic. But if you alter your reaction to these frustrations, they won’t have such a strong hold over you.[5]\n\nCompare the current frustration to similar ones in the past. Will this frustration make a difference in the long run, or are you wasting your energy getting worked up over nothing?\nFor example, let’s say you are unhappy making sandwiches for a job. Put some artfulness into it, arranging the meats colorfully with the vegetables. Think of something nice to say to the customer. Ask the manager if there is something else you can control about the environment, like the music.\nIf you hate traffic, plan ahead and listen to your favorite music in your car.\nTake action to change the frustrating event. If you hate going to work, you might think this way because you want to have a different career. Make a change to fix the situation.",
            "Take time to relax. Oftentimes, we get wrapped up in negativity because we are stressed, overwhelmed, frustrated or angry. When we allow ourselves time to relax and recoup, we can find space to tackle problems with a positive attitude. Set aside time every day for yourself to do something relaxing, whether that’s reading a book, watching your favorite TV show, or talking on the phone with a friend.\n\n\nTry meditation or yoga, or spend a few minutes taking some deep breaths.",
            "Do activities you’re good at. Frustration and negativity often occur because we feel a lack of efficacy, or a lack of success for our efforts. A productive response is to do something you are good at. When you feel good about your abilities, your mindset will improve in the positive direction. Increase how often you do your favorite activities.\n\n\nFor example, if you like knitting, take a break and work on a knitting project. You will get positive energy from this activity because you can see your progress. This positive energy will then influence how you feel about other projects.",
            "Avoid media that causes negative thinking. Research shows that negative thinking is supported by media with negative comparisons.[6] If you notice media making you feel negative, one approach is to avoid that media. If you found yourself frequently comparing yourself to a certain model or athlete, avoid magazines, shows, or games that feature them.\n\n\nEven temporary exposure to media depicting ideal images has been shown to negatively impact self-esteem and self-image.[7]",
            "Try humor. Having fun and laughing can boost your mood and increase your positive reactions to things and people.[8]\n\nAttend a comedy show, watch comedy television, or read a book of jokes. This will help build a sense of humor that is associated with playfulness and positivity.[9]",
            "Surround yourself with positive people. When a friend is negative, his negativity can have the tendency of rubbing off on you. For example, if this person always talks negatively about your school, you might start to think negatively too. This is because this is all you focus on. If you think about the positive aspects of your school, you’ll start to see those more clearly.[10]\n\nBuild a network of people who approach life with positivity. Spend less time with those who bring you down.",
            "Be positive about other people. Sometimes feeling negative is pervasive and affects all our interactions. Negativity can make people not want to spend time with you, adding to a cycle of feeling negative. A way to break out of this cycle and build a positive mindset is to practice social support. Expanding positive comments towards others can help you build a positive thinking mindset.\n\n\nFor example, you can help someone feel good about themselves by recognizing him and pointing out something positive.[11] Compliment him on how well he can sing, for example.\nBeing nice to others is associated with positive outcomes in family, health and career,[12] which will help build your positive-thinking mindset.",
            "Show interest and pride in others. When you interact with others, you can help them feel positively. This will, in turn, increase your own positive mindset. Increase positive thinking in others by showing interest and reinforcing the pride you feel.[13]\n\nWhen you get together with a friend, spend the time talking about what’s new with her. Steer the conversation away from yourself and focus on listening to her.",
            "Take note of when you help others. Write down the ways that you have helped someone else and contributed to his or her wellbeing. It sounds somewhat gratuitous or self-serving. But research shows this kind of behavior can help you feel like you’re making a difference by staying positive.[14]",
            "Join a social group. Belonging to a social group can help reduce negative thinking. Religious affiliation can, for many people, cultivate a positive mindset. [15]",
            "Get enough sleep. It is much easier to handle life’s frustrations and stay positive when you’re not running on empty. Your body needs rest to recover, which will help your mind work more productively and positively. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night.[16]\n\nIf you have trouble falling asleep at night, try dimming the lights a little while before bed. Turn off all screens (computer, TV, phone) at least 30 minutes before you go to bed. This will help your mind settle down for sleep.",
            "Eat well. Feed your body with good fuel that will help you maintain a positive attitude. Avoid processed and fried foods. Eat lots of nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, proteins and whole-grains.\n\n\nEat foods rich in vitamins that are known for their mood-boosting qualities. These include selenium, such as grains, beans, seafood and lean meats; omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish and walnuts; and folate, such as leafy greens and legumes.[17]",
            "Drink plenty of water. Negative moods have been linked to dehydration. Make sure you are getting enough water throughout the day. Aim for 72 ounces of fluids (for women) or 104 ounces of fluids (for men).[18]\n\nSome of your daily fluid intake does occur through the foods you eat. It’s a good idea to shoot for about 8 eight-ounce cups of water every day.",
            "Exercise regularly. As you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which are chemicals linked to positive feelings. Regular exercise can ward off stress, depression, and other ailments.[19]\n\nGet at least 20-30 minutes of exercise three times a week."

    "wikiHow to Clean Drinking Glasses": {
        "intro": "There are several ways to effectively clean drinking glasses with everyday household products. Wash glasses regularly with warm water and a minimal amount of dish soap, and allow the glasses to air dry. If you use a dishwasher, opt for a gentle cycle and space out the glasses to avoid damage. Use a vinegar solution to clean cloudy residue or streaks. For dark stains, try a bleach and water soak, or use plain toothpaste to gently scrub your glasses.",
        "steps": [
            "Clean glasses by hand. Fill your kitchen sink approximately one third to halfway full with warm water and add a few drops of dish washing liquid. Using a clean sponge, gently wash your glasses inside and out. Rinse thoroughly.[1]\n\nAvoid using more than a few drops of dish soap, as excess soap can lead to streaks and residue.",
            "Air dry the glasses. Place clean glasses on a dish mat or clean towel to dry. Position glasses downwards, with the rim on the bottom. Avoid drying your glasses with a cloth, as this can leave residue. [2]",
            "Using a dishwasher. Using a dishwasher is a less effective way to get glasses clean and cloud-free than hand washing. If you prefer using a dishwasher anyway, there are ways to improve the results. For more fragile glasses (e.g. wine glasses), choose a delicate cycle. Leave as much room as possible between glasses to prevent clinking or scraping.[3]\n\nTo prevent residue that sometimes remains on glasses after being run through the dishwasher, add one quarter cup of white vinegar to the machine’s rinse cup.[4]",
            "Make a vinegar solution. If your glasses are cloudy or have white streaks, clean them with vinegar. Fill a medium-sized bowl with white vinegar and warm water. Use two tablespoons of vinegar for every cup of water.[5]",
            "Wipe down the glasses. Dip a clean cloth into the vinegar solution. Gently wipe down the glasses with the cloth, both inside and out. Re-moisten the cloth as needed to ensure that your glasses get clean.[6]",
            "Rinse the glasses. While the smell of vinegar is strong, it will eventually dissipate after drying. To speed up the process, rinse the glasses in cold water to wash away the vinegar solution. Rinsing the glasses, or washing them as you normally would with dish soap, will ensure that the vinegar smell disappears faster.[7]",
            "Soak glasses. If you have numerous glasses to clean, or if the cloudy deposits on your glasses are difficult to remove, soak them in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Fill a basin with the vinegar and water, place your glasses in the basin, and let them sit for twenty minutes. After soaking, rinse the glasses with cold water and let them air dry.[8]",
            "Make a bleach soak. If your drinking glasses have dark stains (e.g. coffee, lipstick), soak them in a bleach solution. Add one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to a gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves and protect your clothing from contact with the bleach while cleaning.[9]",

    "wikiHow to Reverse Insulin Resistance": {
        "intro": "You may assume that a diagnosis of insulin resistance, or prediabetes, means that you have Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Fortunately, it doesn't mean that you're diabetic. It simply means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetic. With insulin resistance, your cells don't effectively respond to insulin which means that the cells don't absorb sugar from the blood.[1] While your risk of developing T2D is very high and diabetes has grown to worldwide epidemic proportions, this can be reversed by losing weight, changing the way you eat, and through exercise.[2][3][4]",
        "steps": [
            "Pick complex carbohydrates. Try to make most of your carbohydrate intake consist of complex carbohydrates. This means that they're more complicated molecularly and take longer for your body to break down. This may help your body break down glucose and may help you feel fuller longer, controlling weight and appetite control. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole unprocessed foods like:[5]\n\nWhole grains\nPeas\nLentils\nBeans\nVegetables",
            "Avoid processed foods. Try to keep your food as close to its original or natural form. To do this, limit processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as much as possible. Processed food often contains large amounts of sugar. Read labels to determine how much sugar is in a product, but realize that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars.\n\n\nAn easy way to avoid processed foods is to avoid \"white\" foods (no white bread, white pasta, or white rice).\nFor example, one 6-ounce serving of flavored low-fat yogurt has 38 grams of sugar (which is the equivalent of 7 teaspoons of sugar).",
            "Cut back on sugary drinks and simple carbohydrates. While sugars alone don't cause diabetes, eating more high-fructose corn syrup is linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance, T2D, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.[6][7] Avoid simple carbohydrates that contain glucose, sucrose, and fructose. These include: [8]\n\nSoft drinks\nSweeteners: maple syrup, honey, table sugars, jams\nCandies, cakes, pastries",
            "Increase your fiber intake. Studies have shown that eating insoluble fiber along with whole grains can reduce your risk of T2D.[9][10] Try to eat insoluble fiber with each meal. For example, you can sprinkle one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds over each meal. Good sources of fiber include:[11]\n\nBrans: corn bran, oat bran, wheat bran\nBeans: navy beans, lentils, kidney beans\nBerries: elderberries, raspberries, blackberries\nWhole grains: bulgur, brown rice, barley, oats\nVegetables: peas, leafy greens, squash\nSeeds and nuts\nFruits: pears, prunes, dried figs",
            "Eat more lean meat and fish. Lean meats and fish are good low-calorie sources of protein. Make sure any meat you choose is not only lean, but skinless (since the skin is high in animal fat, added hormones, and antibiotics). Look for wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna. These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory. Try to eat at least 2 servings of fish each week.[12][13]\n\nLimit red meats like pork, beef or lamb. These have been linked to T2D, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer.[14]",
            "Include more fruits, vegetables, and herbs. You don't need to avoid fruit for fear that it contains sugar. The sugars in fruit are combined with the fiber which slows the absorption of sugars. Try to get 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Don't forget to add herbs that can control your blood sugar levels. These can also help you fight sugar cravings and are safe with no side effects (when taken in commonly used amounts as food). Use these herbs:\n\n\nCinnamon\nFenugreek\nOkra (not quite an herb, but more of a side-dish)\nGinger\nGarlic and onions\nBasil\nBitter melon (more commonly used as a tea three to four times a day)",
            "Choose a physical activity. Moderately increasing your physical activity can help reverse insulin resistance. You don’t have to get ready for a marathon. Just choose a physical activity that you enjoy or are interested in picking up. This way, you're more likely to become active.[15]\n\nYou may start walking more, climbing more stairs, doing more outdoor activities, hiking, gardening, aerobics, Tai chi, yoga, using an elliptical, using a rowing machine, using a stationary bicycle, or stretching.\nConsider whether you want to work out alone, with someone else, or play a group sport.[16]",
            "Start slowly. Start with 10 minutes of activity a day. When you're comfortable with that level of activity, add a few minutes every week. For example, you may tell yourself to walk more. You might try parking your car farther from the office or getting off of the elevator two or three floors early so you can take the stairs the rest of the way. Increase these amounts by parking even farther away or taking more flights of stairs.\n\n\nAvoid setting an extreme goal for yourself early on. You'll be more likely to remain active if you set small, achievable goals.[17]",
            "Become comfortable with more physical activity. Once you've been working out for a while, start to challenge yourself. Work yourself up to 30 minutes of activity a day for at least 5 days of the week. To keep things interesting, you may want to mix up the activities you do. For example, you might swim for 20 minutes and jog for 10 minutes one day.\n\n\nConsider joining a gym and getting a personal trainer. This way, you'll understand how physical conditions can impact your physical activity. A trainer can help you design a personalized fitness plan.",
            "Watch for insulin resistance symptoms. If you notice the skin around your neck, armpits, elbows, knees, and knuckles get darker, you may have a skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans. This is an early sign that you're at risk for T2D and insulin resistance.[18]\n\nYou may also have increased hunger, thirst, fatigue, weight gain, or increased urination.",
            "Consider your risk. There are many things that increase your risk of insulin resistance. These include:[19]\n\nBeing overweight or obese\nBeing physically inactive or sedentary\nHigh blood pressure\nLow HDL cholesterol (“good cholesterol”) levels (less than 35 mg/dL)\nHigh triglyceride levels (over 250 mg/dL)\nBeing older than 45 years old\nHaving a family history of diabetes\nHaving a history of gestational diabetes, giving birth to a baby with a birth weight of more than 9 pounds or a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nFor women, having a waist measurement of more than 35 inches\nFor men, having a waist measurement of more than 40 inches",
            "Get a diagnosis. Often, insulin resistance has no symptoms. Instead, your doctor may notice your blood sugar is higher than normal.[20] The doctor then will run one of these tests:\n\n\nA1c: This test measures how your body has handled sugars for the last 3 months. An A1c result of over 6.5% is a diagnosis for T2D while insulin resistance is diagnosed at levels between 5.7 and 6.4%.[21]\n\nFasting blood glucose test: You'll need to fast for several hours. Then, your blood is drawn to measure blood sugar levels. Fasting blood sugar levels between 100–125 mg/dL suggest insulin resistance.[22]\n\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Your blood is drawn to measure blood sugar levels. You'll then drink a very sweet beverage and have your blood drawn two hours later. Your blood sugar is measured again. This test determines how well your body handles sugars.[23]",
            "Talk with your doctor. Once you've been diagnosed with insulin resistance, you should get regular checkups. Talk with your doctor about any dietary changes you've made, weight loss plans, and your activity levels. Your doctor will want to do regular blood tests to check your blood sugar levels.\n\n\nTrack your labs and use them as motivation to keep making diet and lifestyle changes.",
            "Talk to your doctor about medication. Once you have been diagnosed as prediabetic, you may want to take a medication that helps control your blood sugar, such as metformin.[24] Ask your doctor about using this in combination with lifestyle and dietary changes to delay or reverse the onset of type 2 diabetes.[25]"

    "wikiHow to Grow Marigolds": {
        "intro": "Marigolds are very easy to grow and are available in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, orange, red, and mixed colors. They will bloom from mid-summer all the way until frost. Marigolds also come in a wide range of sizes, from miniatures smaller than a foot to giant varieties that can grow up to four feet tall! You can select the color and size that is perfect for your flower garden. And don't overlook marigolds in container gardens, as the smaller varieties do well in containers.",
        "steps": [
            "Determine what growing zone you live in. The USDA has defined 13 growing zones for the United States, ranging from the extremely cold Zone 1 (in far-north Alaska) to the extremely warm Zone 13 (in parts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico).[1] Most of the country ranges from Zone 3 to Zone 10. Marigolds are annual plants in most zones, meaning they will die in the winter and will not return the next growing season.\n\n\nMarigolds are hardy, self-seeding flowers. If you live in Zone 8 or higher, your marigolds may not die off during the winter and will probably return with fuller vigour the following spring.",
            "Know when to plant your marigolds. Although marigolds are a very hardy plant, they can die in cold weather. Plant marigolds after the last frost. American (African) marigolds should be planted immediately after the last frost because they are slow to mature.[2]\n\nIf possible, plant your marigolds on a cloudy day or in the morning; this will help prevent further transplant shock to the plants from the heat.",
            "Decide whether you will use seeds or seedlings. Seeds will take a few weeks to germinate but cost much less. Seedlings or plants bought from a gardening store will give you immediate satisfaction but are more expensive.\n\n\nWhile it's not necessary, you can start the seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before you want to plant them outside. Marigolds can also be directly seeded into the ground outdoors when the soil temperatures reach 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit ( Late May to Mid June) as well. Short varieties such as the French Marigolds germinate quickly and flower very fast within few weeks after planting.\nIf you use seedlings or plants, you can plant them as soon as the last frost is gone.",
            "Determine where you will grow your marigolds. Marigolds grow well both in flowerbeds and in pots and other containers, but they need space to spread out. Fully grown marigold plants in beds should be spaced 2 to 3 feet apart so that they can get enough sunlight.[3]\n\nMarigolds perform best in full sunlight, although they can handle up to 20% shade. Do not plant them in a fully shaded area, as they will not thrive.[4]\n\nMarigolds are tolerant of dry, sandy soil, but they do not grow well in overly damp soil. Make sure your beds or containers have adequate drainage; you can add a layer of gravel to the bottom and cover it with soil before planting to enhance draining.[5]",
            "Decide what size marigold you want to grow. There are four main groups of marigold species, and each of them produce variations in color and size. This varies greatly on the cultivar or variety you grow. You can always get size info on the package of seeds itself or looking it up on the web.[6]\n\nAfrican marigolds Tagetes erecta come in two basic varieties: “large-flowered” and “tall.” Large-flowered African marigolds are fairly short, at between 12-14” tall, but as the name suggests have very large blossoms (up to 3.5” inches in diameter). Tall African marigolds have small flowers but can grow up to 3’ tall. Both almost always produce orange or yellow flowers. African marigolds may also be referred to as “American” marigolds.\nFrench marigolds Tagetes patula come in two basic varieties: “large-flowered” and “dwarf.” Large-flowered French marigolds are between 12-16” tall with large (up to 2”) flower blossoms. Dwarf French marigolds rarely grow higher than 12” and produce small flowers. French marigolds come in varieties of yellow, gold, and orange.\nTriploid marigolds are a hybrid of French and African marigolds and are also sometimes known as “mule” marigolds because they cannot reproduce. They grow fairly tall and produce large (up to 2”) flowers.\nSingle marigolds are also known as signet marigolds Tagetes tenuifolia. They are quite different in appearance from other marigold varieties because their flowers have very simple, almost daisy-like flowers rather than the thick, bushy blossoms of most other marigold types also these varieties are more wild looking.",
            "Purchase seeds. Seed packets can range in price anywhere from 10 cents to a dollar or more per pack, depending on the breed. You can purchase seeds from garden supply centers, superstores, and online retailers.\n\n\nFrench marigolds start from seed much faster than African marigolds. Hybrid varieties will not usually start from seed.[7]\n\nIf you have leftover seeds, you can save them for the following growing season. Seal them in an air-tight container such as a mason jar in a cool, dry place.[8]",
            "Use a divided seed planter to start your seeds. It’s best to use a divided seed container so that you can easily separate the roots of your seedlings once they’ve begun to grow. You can purchase these at most gardening stores.\n\n\nYou can also use an egg carton filled with potting mix to start your seeds.",
            "Fill the seed planter with potting mix or seed starting mix. It is preferable to use a nutrient-enriched soil or mix when starting seeds, rather than straight topsoil, as it will give the seeds an extra nutritional boost and make it easy for young roots to take hold.",
            "Sow the seeds in the soil. Refer to the package directions for the appropriate planting depth, as this will vary by marigold breed. Avoid sowing more than 2 seeds in the same division of your seed planter; sowing too many seeds in the same spot will force them to fight for sunlight and oxygen and will prevent rapid growth.",
            "Moisten the soil daily using a spray bottle. Watering newly sown seeds with a watering can could simply wash the seeds away. Use a spray bottle filled with clean water to mist the soil until it’s damp.[9]",
            "Thin the seedlings when they reach 2” tall. Use a spoon or other small tool to dig the seedling out of the planter, being careful not to damage the roots. Remove any dead or browning seedlings.",
            "Transplant marigolds once they’ve reached 6” tall. Transplant marigolds into your garden beds or containers when they’re about 6” tall and look fairly sturdy. Handle the plants with care so as not to damage the roots.[10]",
            "Loosen the soil by digging to a minimum depth of 6”. Use a hand aerating tool, a hoe, or even your hands to break up large clods of soil and make sure it is aerated so that oxygen can reach the roots of your plants.\n\n\nRemove any sticks, stones, or debris from the soil. These will hinder root growth.",
            "Dig a shallow hole for planting. The root ball of the marigold plant should be able to fit into the hole while the leaves remain above ground.",
            "Place the plant in the hole. Cover the root ball with soil and pat firmly in place. Use a watering can to water the plant at the base, watering until the soil is moist but not flooded.",
            "Prevent weeds with mulch. Spreading a 1-2” layer of mulch, pine bark, or other organic material on your beds between marigold plants will help prevent weeds from growing. It will also help the soil retain moisture, meaning you don’t have to water as often.[11]",
            "Fertilize the soil. Most fertilizers available for home use contain three basic nutrients essential for plant growth: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n\nThe three numbers on packaged fertilizer reflect the concentrations of each nutrient. Marigolds thrive on a 20-10-20 (20% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, and 20% potassium) fertilizer.[12]\n\nDon’t over-fertilize the soil or it will actually damage your marigolds. Fertilizing once every two weeks is plenty. It's also a good idea to dilute your fertilizer more than the package recommends.\nIn place of fertilizer, you can use compost instead.",
            "Water your marigolds at the bottom, not from the top. Pouring water over the marigold blossoms and leaves may damage or even rot them. Instead, use a watering can to water your flowers at the base of the plants.\n\n\nTry to avoid using a garden hose to water your plants. The force of the water may wash away the top layer of soil.",
            "Deadhead your marigolds. “Deadheading” is a cultivating process in which you snip off dead blossoms from flowering plants. While not strictly necessary, deadheading your marigolds will help prompt the plant to produce new flowers.\n\n\nTo keep marigolds compact, pinch off new, unwanted growth.[13]",
            "Use insecticidal soap to prevent infestation. Although marigolds are very hardy, they may sometimes have pest problems. A mild solution of insecticidal soap, which is sold at most gardening supply stores and even supermarkets, will help keep pests at bay without presenting a toxic hazard.\n\n\nSome marigold species are edible. If you use marigolds in any edible preparation, wash them thoroughly first to remove any insecticidal soap residue. Do not eat marigolds that have had chemical pesticides sprayed on them.",
            "Stake your flowers, if necessary. Most marigold species grow quite close to the ground, but if you’ve chosen a taller variety such as the African marigold, you may need to provide a stake to support the stalk. Use stakes about 2’ high and tie the plant to the stake with a soft, stretchy fabric. (Old nylon stockings work very well for this!)[14]"

    "wikiHow to Disinfect Earplugs": {
        "intro": "Your reusable earplugs seem like one of life’s simple pleasures. They block out the many loud and annoying sounds you don’t want to hear throughout the day. Earplugs can make you more comfortable as you enjoy swimming or get a good night’s rest. But, they work best when they are washed regularly. Clean earplugs protect the health of your ears.",
        "steps": [
            "Inspect your reusable earplugs, first. You are checking to see if your earplugs are torn, bent, or excessively dirty.[1]\n\nYour earplugs can harden and become rigid if they are covered in a lot of earwax and skin oils from your ear canal. This loss of flexibility will prevent you from getting a good seal when you use your earplugs.[2][3][4]\n\nYour ear canal connects your outer ear with your eardrum. It makes earwax, which is a mixture of shed skin cells, a little bit of dust, and a fat-like secretions from the glands in the canal. The secretions from the glands lubricate the ear canal and fight off infections from bacteria and fungi. [5] When you insert earplugs covered with stains and other materials, you run the risk of overwhelming your ear canal’s natural defenses with too much dirt and germs.[6][7]",
            "Throw away your damaged or dirty earplugs. Do not continue with trying to disinfect them. Buy yourself a new pair of reusable earplugs.[8][9]\n\nReusable earplugs can be made from a variety of materials. The more common reusable earplugs are made from pre-molded silicone rubber, vinyl, other hypoallergenic synthetic rubbers, and foam covered in a special material or “skin”. These types of earplugs can be used more than once because they are very durable and long-lasting when washed properly. But, they are not indestructible and must be replaced.[10][11][12]",
            "Have a hands-off approach. You want to keep your earplugs clean, but sometimes your schedule will not allow for the time it takes to wash them by hand. Clean your earplugs in the washing machine, the dishwasher, or boiling water. You still have to air dry them and store them in their case.[13]\n\nKeep track of your small earplugs. Put your earplugs in a fine mesh bags used for produce, close the bag with a rubber band, and wash them in the dishwasher.[14] You can put your earplugs in a delicates washing bag when you clean them in the washing machine.\nBe careful not to damage your earplugs.",
            "Treat your earplugs gently with a hand washing. Fill a bowl with a cleaning solution. The solution can be soapy water or hydrogen peroxide. Add a mild soap, like dish detergent, to warm water and mix until you see suds. Or, use undiluted hydrogen peroxide.[15]",
            "Soak your earplugs in the cleaning solution. Let them sit undisturbed in the soapy water or hydrogen peroxide for several minutes. You will know exactly how long your earplugs need to soak after a couple of cleanings.[16]",
            "Scrub your earplugs, gently, in new soapy water. Discard the old cleaning solution. It contains the dirt and grime you are trying to get off your earplugs. Remove any visible materials with your fingers, a soft cloth, or a soft brush, like a toothbrush.[17][18]\n\nBuy a new toothbrush just for this purpose. A used toothbrush, even if it has been cleaned, will still have bacteria from your mouth on it.",
            "Rinse your earplugs with cold water. Move on to this step only after you have removed all of the dirt and stains with a thorough scrub. Do not leave behind any matter which may harden your earplugs; this may force you to discard them sooner than you want.[19]",
            "Wipe your earplugs with alcohol. Your earplugs have been disinfected. They should be soft and clean without any deformities or tears.[20][21]",
            "Air dry your earplugs in a clean place. Let your ear plugs dry completely before you use them. You can squeeze the ear plugs or pat them gently with a towel to get out some of the excess moisture.[22]\n\nUsing moist earplugs can lead to irritation, pain, or infection. The skin in your ear canal does not respond well to extra moisture.[23][24]",
            "Store your dry ear plugs in their case. It is a good habit to immediately return your earplugs to their case whenever you are not using them. This keeps your clean earplug protected from damage as well as any dust and dirt.[25][26]\n\nYour reusable earplugs will last from a couple of weeks to several months. It depends on how often you use your earplugs, how often you clean them, what type of earplugs you buy as well as where and how you store them.[27]",
            "Wash your earplugs after every use. This can be time consuming, but it is worth the effort. You decrease your chances of developing ear irritation or an infection from earplugs covered in earwax, skin oils, and dust.[28]",
            "Do not share your earplugs with anyone. You are sharing whatever germs, earwax, and skin oils the other person has in her ear canal. This is another way you could develop ear irritation or an infection.[29][30]",
            "Think about using only disposable earplugs. You can throw away your earplugs after every use. This is a reliable way to make sure your earplugs are always in good working condition. But, you may end up spending more money this way, and it creates more waste.[31]",
            "Do not use your earplugs all the time. When you keep them in for long periods of time, your earplugs stop the normal process of earwax being moved through your ear canal towards your outer ear. Take out your earplugs sometimes and let your ear canals “breathe.”[32]\n\nYour earplugs can push earwax deeper into your canal where it builds up and hardens. You may develop ear pain, ringing in your ears, irritation, infection, discharge and even hearing loss.[33][34]",
            "Do not clean and re-use disposable earplugs. A washing may cause your earplugs to degrade. They can no longer protect your hearing from loud noises or keep water out of your ears when you swim. Having earplugs that properly guard your ears is an important part of good ear hygiene.[35][36]\n\nMaterials, like uncovered foam and soft wax, used in single-use or disposable ear plugs are not designed to be cleaned with soapy water or alcohol. If your disposable ear plugs are no longer soft and pliable, they cannot form a good fit in your ears.[37][38]",

    "wikiHow to Be More Affectionate": {
        "intro": "Affection is a physical expression of feelings. It is usually associated with love and long-term relationships because a steady stream of affection can make people closer. Studies have shown that children who receive high levels of caressing affection as children had lower levels of stress. [1] Other studies have shown that relationships that have higher rates of physical affection report more relationship satisfaction. [2]",
        "steps": [
            "Recognize discomfort. Some people are uncomfortable with touch because of personality, family history, intimacy issues or trauma. This can make it difficult to initiate or enjoy displays of physical affection, such as caressing, hugging, holding hands or cuddling.[3]\n\nDeal with your fears regarding intimacy and connecting physically with another person. Accept that you are afraid, and find out where it’s coming from. It can be helpful to realize that your fears are probably not related to your current partner or events, and to try to move past them.[4]\n\nTalk to your partner and let them know that you are uncomfortable and why. Ask him or her to be patient. Showing physical affection can be easier as you get to know someone better and deal with the root causes of your discomfort with physical intimacy. Plus, improving communication may lead to a closer and more affectionate relationship.\nTalk to a professional about it. They can help you deal with the negative emotions related to your fears and get over your hesitation to show physical affection. If you don’t want to talk to someone, you can write about it in a journal or express your feelings in other ways.\nMake showing physical affection a habit. Hold your partner’s hand, touch their shoulder or give them a hug as often as possible. Eventually, showing affection physically will come easier and more natural.",
            "Schedule cuddle time with kids or spouses. Touching helps relieve stress and pain, can help people cope and strengthen bonds.[5] Put cuddle time on your daily schedule with your family to promote physical and psychological health. Date night, story time and even TV watching time can all be combined with cuddling.",
            "Hold hands. Whether it is with your partner or your kids, holding hands is quick, painless and can really cement your bond. In fact, it is probably one of the easiest ways to immediately increase the amount of physical affection you show for another person. Whether you are walking to the bus stop, through grocery isles or sitting at home on the couch, reach over and take someone’s hand that you care about.",
            "Include physical touch in your list of health goals. Having contact with your kids and partner can release oxytocin, the cuddle hormone, which lowers blood pressure. It can also help you control the stress hormone cortisol.[6] Physical touch activates the orbitofrontal cortex in the brain, which contributes to rewarding feelings and can even boost the immune system.[7]",
            "List healthy ways that you can be physically affectionate. Physical affection is any touch that is meant to boost affectionate feelings or love in the giver or receiver.[8] Write down your list so you can refer to it later. Then, make it a goal to do each method at various points throughout the week.\n\n\nSome ways that you can show affection include: kissing, back rubs, massages, caressing, cuddling, holding, hugging and holding hands. There may be other methods specific to you or your relationship that can also relay feelings of love.\nAlthough it may take 21 days to form a habit, the time length depends upon the person. Continue referencing this list for several months to permanently change how much physical affection you show.",
            "Give playful nudges. Finding humor with your partner can be enhanced by good-natured physical contact. This may be a gentle squeeze, shoulder or knee nudge, playful slap, knuckle nudge or soft push. Always be sure that your partner doesn’t mind when you nudge them and never hit hard, cause pain or leave bruises.[9]",
            "Put your feet together. You can wrap your legs and feet together, play footsie under the table, put your feet in your partner’s lap or vice versa. This connects you physically and keeps you aware of each other’s presence if you are sitting directly across from him or her. Remember, any physical contact that is intended to convey affectionate feelings is a form of physical affection.",
            "Try a massage. Along with other forms of physical affection, giving massages can help bring you closer in your relationship. Additionally, massages have health benefits including: reducing stress, increased blood and nutrient flow and helping with pain. For all these reasons, a back, foot or body massage is a great way to show physical affection. Your partner will probably enjoy it and hopefully return the favor.",
            "Give verbal affirmations. Giving verbal affection, such as saying, “I love you” or “I care about you”, is an important way to strengthen bonds and is even good for you physically and mentally.[10] Don’t let texting or emailing the ones you love replace verbal affection. If you are apart, then pick up the phone to check in because it’s more personal, even if it takes more time.\n\n\nVerbal expressions of affection are the words you speak intended to validate your positive feelings of love and affection and make your partner feel loved. This can be unique to you, your partner and your relationship as long as what you say produces the intended emotions and reinforces your affection for each other.\nIf you must use electronic modes of communication, sign off with a phrase like “Thinking of you” or “Miss you” instead of a something generic. [11]",
            "Understand that long-distance relationships require more verbal affection. Since you won’t be able to physically touch and bolster your bond that way, you will need to tell him or her how you feel more often. This is important to maintain the closeness in your relationship and reinforce feelings of safety, comfort and trust. If possible, use Skype or Google Hangout so you can make eye contact and pick up on physical cues while talking.",
            "Compliment someone you care about every day. Compliments are a form of showing verbal affection that can boost self-esteem, show you care and make the ones you care about feel good. Additionally, compliments motivate people to succeed because they believe they can. Always give truthful compliments though or you risk what you said being dismissed as shallow flattery.\n\n\nLook for things that you admire, appreciate or that the other person is good at to compliment. This can be anything from the way they look, a feature of their face that you particularly enjoy (such as eyes or lips), a personality trait, accomplishments, the positive way they make you feel or a skillset that you admire.\nBe honest, and don’t let opportunities to compliment those you love pass you by. Tell your wife, “You have beautiful eyes” while looking at her or “You complete me”, if it’s true. Tell your husband, “You look handsome in that shirt” when he gets ready for work or “You’re a great cook” when he makes you breakfast. Tell your child, “You’re so smart” when you see a report card or “You’re good at sports” after practice.",
            "Greet your partner or children when they get home. Stop what you are doing and interact with your partner or children so they know you care. You want them to know they are more important than anything else and that you missed them. Combine verbal affection with physical affection by giving your kids a peck on the cheek or top of the head. You may want to kiss your partner on the lips or cheek.",
            "Nickname your partner or children. A positive nickname shows that you have a special bond. The name you choose usually reflects some characteristic, habit or event related to the person. It can also be a shortened form of their legal name.\n\n\nSome common nicknames include: Angel, Cowboy, Doll, Babe, Dear, Honey, Love or Sweetheart or Sweetie.",
            "Take the time to say “thank you”. Think of all the things the other person does for you or the ways they improve your life. Look them in the eyes and express your appreciation in a few sentences. You want them to know exactly how much you love and appreciate them and everything they do.",
            "Don’t assume that “I love you” is the only way to express affection. If you are not saying it, you should try to make it a regular part of your vocabulary. Phrases like “You’re great”, and “I’m so lucky to have you”, are also good ways to show affection. There is probably also something specific to your relationship, such as a mutual interest in cars, that allows you to expand on these simple phrases to include descriptions of something you really love for added meaning. If you love cars, then you might use a favorite vehicle to explain how you feel by saying, “You’re my 1968 Plymouth Road Runner Hemi.”",
            "Return affection automatically. Answer cues by returning hugs, complimenting, saying “I Love You,” kissing someone on the cheek or high fiving. Ignore the urge to hesitate during these moments. If you aren’t used to doing this, it may take some practice but will become second nature in time.",
            "Don’t let only one parent be the “affectionate parent”. In decades past, it was not as culturally important for dads to be affectionate to kids. However, times have changed. Both parents should strive to show affection to their children, even if it is not natural for one of them.",
            "Make eye contact. While you are cuddling, holding hands or giving a compliment, eye contact connects you further and shows you are serious. Studies have shown that staring into the eyes of someone you love (even a pet) can increase oxytocin hormone levels. This can make you both feel really good and is well worth the effort.",
            "Give yourself goals. Motivational strategists believe that good habits can be established by dreaming big about the way you would like things to be, such as being a more affectionate parent. Then, give yourself micro quotas, such as “I am going to spend 20 minutes conversing directly with my children every day.” Always break down larger goals into smaller goals so they are more obtainable and give you the opportunity to celebrate your successes more often.[12]",
            "Don’t be afraid to talk to a professional. If you have no desire to show affection or feel affection but can’t express it, consider speaking to a counselor or therapist—either alone or with your partner. Relationships take work. Don’t associate couple’s counseling or seeking therapy on your own with weakness. If you love someone and want to make it work, then nothing should keep you from seeking help to make your relationship stronger."

    "wikiHow to Take Care of an Overheated Guinea Pig": {
        "intro": "Guinea pigs are adorable little animals that make great pets. They can overheat easily, though, and become very sick. An overheated guinea pig needs to be treated by a veterinarian right away, so it will be important for you to recognize when your guinea pig is too hot and get him the care he needs as soon as possible.",
        "steps": [
            "Recognize the signs of heatstroke. Your guinea pig’s small size increases his risk of heatstroke. When the outside temperature reaches at least 82°F (28°C) and the humidity is high, he may be at even higher risk of overheating.[1] Knowing what your guinea pig will look like when he is overheating will help you jump into action and get him the care he needs.\n\n\nGuinea pigs suffering from heatstroke will have trouble breathing, have a bright red tongue, and start slobbering (‘wet chin’). They will also become very weak, look depressed, and maybe even start convulsing.[2]\n\nAn overheated guinea pig can die if not treated quickly, so you need to be quick with noticing when he needs to cool down.[3]",
            "Call your veterinarian. Your veterinarian should know when your guinea pig is overheating.[4] When you call, give the veterinary team as much information as you can about your guinea pig, such as how long he was outside, when you noticed he was overheating, and how he looks now. Calling your veterinarian will also let them know that you will be coming in with an emergency case.",
            "Remove your guinea pig from the hot area. Take your guinea pig to a cool part of your house and start giving him first aid.[5] Guinea pigs are not able to cool off by sweating or panting,[6] so your guinea pig will not be able to cool off on his own.",
            "Cool down your guinea pig. You may be scared at how sick your guinea pig looks, but you will need to stay calm and act quickly to help him feel better. Get a bowl and fill it with about an 1 1/2 inch (4 centimeters) of lukewarm water. Place your guinea pig’s feet in the water for about 10 minutes, letting him stand if he is strong enough to do so.[7]\n\nContinue to hold him if he is not able to stand on his own.\nIf you do not have a bowl nearby, put the same amount of water in a sink and place your guinea pig's feet in the sink.\nIt is very important that the water is lukewarm. Cold water could cool your guinea pig down too rapidly and cause him to go into shock.[8]\n\nSlowly dampen the rest of your guinea pig’s body (e.g., ears, abdomen) with the water. Do not submerse him completely in the water — this could also cause him to go into shock.[9]",
            "Do not give fluids to your guinea pig. Heatstroke plus dehydration equals a very sick guinea pig and trying to rehydrate him on your own could make him even sicker.[10] For example, if he is having trouble breathing, he could accidentally inhale the liquid into his lungs. However, if the guinea pig is conscious offer him water to drink.\n\n\nLeave the task of rehydrating your guinea pig to your veterinarian.",
            "Take your guinea pig to your veterinarian. Your guinea pig will be very sick from overheating, so he will need treatment from your veterinarian as soon as possible. To keep him cool on your way to the veterinarian’s office, place him on a cool, damp towel.[11]\n\nDampen the towel with the same lukewarm water from the bowl or sink. You can also wrap your guinea pig in the towel.[12]\n\nTurn on the air conditioning (AC) in your car. You could roll down the windows if the AC isn’t working, but this may not let in enough cool to air to keep your guinea pig cooled down.[13]\n\nYour veterinarian will continue to give your guinea pig first aid by keeping him cool and rehydrating him with intravenous fluids. Your veterinarian will also give your guinea pig extra oxygen if he is having trouble breathing.[14]\n\nYour veterinarian will monitor your guinea pig intensively for signs of organ damage or failure due to heatstroke. This involves taking blood samples.[15]\n\nYour guinea pig will recover in a cool, quiet, and dark area of your veterinarian’s office. Put him in the same type of area when you bring him home.",
            "Give your guinea pig plenty of water. Your guinea pig needs water regardless of the temperature outside, but it will be even more important to keep him well hydrated in the spring and summer. Fill his water bottle with fresh, cool water. If you are not home during the day, use a large water bottle that will not run too low when you are away.\n\n\nConsider placing the water bottle on the outside of his cage, leaving only the tip of the water bottle’s snout inside the cage. This would keep your guinea pig from chewing on and possibly damaging the sipper tube.[16]\n\nRefill the water bottle whenever the water level gets low.\nWhen you have your guinea pig outside, place the water bottle in the shaded part of his run or cage. The area of shade will change according to the position of the sun, so you will need to move the water bottle periodically.[17]",
            "Turn up the AC. When it gets hot outside, it is best to keep your guinea pig inside. The ideal temperature for your guinea pig is 64 to 68°F (18 to 20°C). Depending on the temperature inside your house, you may have to crank up your AC to keep your guinea pig cool and comfortable.\n\n\nIf you are using a portable air conditioner, make sure the air is not blowing directly into your guinea pig’s cage. The direct airflow could lead to an upper respiratory infection. If you turned down the thermostat, make sure his cage is not in the direct path of the room’s vents.\nFans are good for evaporating sweat. However, since guinea pigs do not sweat, fans are not that useful.[18]",
            "Keep your guinea pig cool when he is outside. Having outside time is important for guinea pigs. You will need to take special precautions when you take him outside in the spring and summer. For example, take him outside when it is a little cooler—early in the mornings or late in the evening.[19]\n\nIf you have your guinea pig in a cage outside, cover his cage with cool, damp towels to create a cool, shaded area for him. Reposition the towels depending on the angle of the sun.\nPlace ice packs or frozen water bottles in your guinea pig’s run or cage. He can lie up against them to cool himself off. Wrap them in towels first so he does not get too cold or damage the skin on his paw pads.\nPut a ceramic tile or brick in his run or cage (whichever is most convenient for you to obtain). They repel heat and give your guinea pig something cool on which to lie.\nYou can also fill a large bowl with ice cubes, cover it, and place it in his run or cage. He can lie against this to keep him cool. Covering it will keep him from falling in.[20]\n\nConsider spritzing your guinea pig occasionally with cool (not cold) water.[21]\n\nCheck on your guinea pig at least every 20 minutes when he is outside.[22]",
            "Groom your guinea pig. Taking care of your guinea pig’s coat can help keep him cool in the spring and summer. For example, combing and brushing his coat can remove excess fur and matts that could trap heat and cause your guinea pig to overheat.[23] Combs and brushes suitable for guinea pigs are available at your local pet store.\n\n\nUse a soft-bristled brush and brush in the direction of the fur, making sure not to pull the fur.[24]\n\nFor the matts, you can try to comb them out or cut them out with a pair of small scissors. Have another person wrap the guinea pig in a towel and hold him if you want to use scissors. If the matts are large, try to comb them out over several grooming sessions.[25]\n\nGroom your guinea pig every day,[26] especially if he has long hair.\nTake your guinea pig to a groomer if you are not comfortable grooming your guinea pig yourself."

    "wikiHow to Control Arthritis Pain in Dogs": {
        "intro": "Dogs are wonderful companions—they can bring you joy and comfort when you need it most. As your dog ages, you can repay the kindnesses your dog shows you by making him as comfortable as possible. Old dogs often develop arthritis, though the condition is not always exclusive to old age. If your dog has developed arthritis, there are both medical and natural ways that you can keep your furry friend comfortable and happy. Keep in mind that you should always talk to your dog’s vet before giving your dog medications, including over-the-counter meds.",
        "steps": [
            "Talk to a vet about giving your dog aspirin to treat intermittent pain. If your dog limps after a long hike or a hard run, but generally doesn’t show signs of pain on a day-to-day basis, you may consider giving your dog aspirin, rather than prescription medication, on the days when he is in pain. Aspirin helps to relieve pain and inflammation. You should not give your dog aspirin every day, only on relatively rare occasions.[1]\n\nGive an otherwise healthy, hydrated dog 10mg per every kilogram of weight, twice a day, with or after food. For example, a typical dose for a 30kg Labrador would be one 300 mg tablet twice a day with food.\nAlways give aspirin with or after food because taking aspirin with an empty stomach on a regular basis can lead to gastrointestinal problems like ulcers.\nNever give aspirin to a dog who is taking steroid medication or other NSAID medications.",
            "Consider giving your dog paracetamol (aka acetaminophen). This over-the-counter medication gives mild to moderate pain relief. It is a part of the NSAID (non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs) family and will also keep your dog’s joints from becoming inflamed. You can give your dog:\n\n\n10 mg per kg of weight, by mouth, twice a day, with or after food. For example, most acetaminophen comes in 500 mg tablets, so a 30 kg Labrador could take three-fifths of a tablet twice a day, with food.\nThe side effects are similar to aspirin. Always make sure that your dog has eaten and is hydrated before giving him this medication, because acetaminophen can cause liver damage and ulcers. Never go over the recommended dose.",
            "Give your dog prescription NSAIDs. As stated above, NSAIDs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If your dog is in moderate to severe pain and needs relief every day, you should go to a veterinarian to get a prescription for strong NSAIDs or opioids (see Step 4) because these medications are safe for long term use. Prescription NSAIDs fight pain and inflammation but have less negative effects on the stomach, liver and kidneys than over-the-counter NSAIDs do.[2]\n\nThe most commonly prescribed NSAIDs are meloxicam (Metacam), carprofen (Rimadyl), and robenacoxib (Onsior).\nThe maintenance dose of metacam is 0.05 mg/kg by mouth, with or after food, once daily. For example, the oral suspension metacam is 1.5 mg/ml and so a 30 kg Lab requires 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz) daily on his food.",
            "Talk to a vet about giving your dog opioids. If your dog is in severe pain, your vet will most likely prescribe an opioid. This type of medication is like morphine but does not sedate your dog or cause stomach irritation. They can be taken with NSAIDs without any ill effects.\n\n\nMost veterinarians prescribe a dose of 2 mg/kg, twice daily. Tramadol, the most common opioid comes in 50 mg or 100 mg and the capsules should not be split, so Tramadol may not be an option for small dogs because you cannot give a low enough dose.\nToo high a dose will result in profound sedation, which usually wears off after 6 – 8 hours.",
            "Put your dog on a diet. When a dog has arthritis, it can be hard for him to move around and maintain a healthy weight. However, the extra weight can actually make the arthritis worse, so it’s important to help your dog with weight control. Cut back the amount of food your dog gets every day and you will most likely see a drastic improvement in his condition.[3]\n\nIn fact, it has been proven[4] that actually helping your dog lose that burden of extra weight can relieve their arthritis so much that they don’t need to take medication anymore. It is good to keep your dog on medication while he loses weight, but when he gets back to a healthy weight, you can talk to your vet about taking him off medication.",
            "Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise. While an arthritic dog may have a hard time walking, it is still important to make sure that he gets regular low-impact exercise because getting no exercise can actually make his joints stiffer. Low-impact exercise helps joint fluid to circulate (keeping your dog flexible), promotes good blood circulation, and keeps up muscle strength.[5]\n\nYour dog should exercise for the same length of time every day. A good baseline amount of exercise is 30 minutes of walking, swimming, or running every day. Swimming in particular is good because it gets your dog moving but takes the pressure off of his hips and joints.",
            "Help your dog by giving him heat therapy. Heat therapy is great for getting rid of pain in a specific spot. Heat helps keep synovial fluid circulating (so that your dog can feel limber) and reduces the build-up of inflammatory chemicals within the joint (which makes your dog’s joints stiff).[6] You can provide your dog with heat therapy by:\n\n\nGetting your dog a heated sleeping pad. Heated sleeping pads both provide heat for your dog, so he is less stiff in the morning, while also cushioning his arthritic joints, making him more comfortable.\nCover your dog with a blanket on chill nights. The blanket will keep your dog warm, which will help keep his joints from stiffening up.\nGet a microwaveable wheat bag. These bags can be heated in the microwave and then placed on the spot where your dog experiences the most pain and stiffness.",
            "Put down padding that can help your dog walk on slippery floors. Smooth hardwood floors can pose a challenge to an arthritic dog because he cannot get a good grip as he walks. Because of this, you might want to consider putting a grippy surface, such as the no-slip grip pads you put under rugs, on hardwood floors to help your dog move around.\n\n\nIt is particularly helpful to put carpeting or grip pads on slippery stairs if your dog goes up and down the stairs. This will help him to get up and down without falling.",
            "Put ramps in your house. You can take the strain off sore joints by offering your dog a ramp to access the car or another level of your house. Ramps make it easier to get up and down stairs because they take the pressure off of your dog’s arthritic joints.[7]\n\nSome dogs will ignore their pain in an effort to follow you upstairs at night, so it might be a good idea to put up a barrier at the bottom of your stairs if your dog wants to come up but you have not purchased non-skid carpeting or a ramp yet.",
            "Elevate your dog’s food and water bowl. Sometimes, dogs can get arthritis in their necks and spines. If your dog has this problem, you can make his life a lot easier by putting his food and water bowl on a short table or elevating it in some other way. When you do this, he will be able to access his food and water much more easily without having to put painful pressure on his neck and spine."

    "wikiHow to Respect Your Partner": {
        "intro": "If you want to have a passionate, long-term and successful relationship, then you have to start with a baseline of mutual respect. You have to make sure that you see you and your partner as a team and that you’re considerate, honest, and compassionate as much as possible. However, nobody’s perfect, and you have to be prepared to apologize sincerely when you have made a mistake. If both you and your partner are willing to put in the effort you can have a fulfilling and respectful relationship.",
        "steps": [
            "Look at yourselves as true partners. If you want to respect your partner, then you have to be able to see yourselves as a true team together. You should think like a team in your mutual decisions and always think of your partner when you make individual decisions. You should think about you both striving toward goals that make both of you stronger instead of feeling like you have opposing needs and wants. If you truly look at yourselves as a unit, then you’ll be able to give your partner the respect that she/he deserves.\n\n\nWhen you and your partner go out into the world, you should think of yourselves as a united front. Though you can’t always agree on everything, you should work on treating each other with kindness and dignity and in making decisions that help each other.\nThough you don’t have to have all of the same thoughts, you can practice saying “We” when you’re making a decision together instead of always starting your sentences with “I…”",
            "If you don’t agree with your partner, discuss the situation respectfully. You can’t always be on the same page as your partner, and that’s perfectly fine. However, when differences do arise, it’s important that you discuss them respectfully. If you say something like, “That’s a stupid idea…” or, “I can’t believe you want to do that…” then this will make your partner feel angry and defensive and won’t lead to a productive conversation. Instead, take the time to listen to your partner and to be kind as they share their opinions.[1]\n\nRemember that if you start by being aggressive and angry, your partner will be much less likely to share their ideas or to compromise.\nInstead of being condescending or mean when you don’t agree, focus on phrasing it with \"I\" language, such as “I understand why you would see it that way…” or, “I just don’t think that’s the most suitable option right now…” Remember that how you say things can be just as important as what you say.",
            "Learn to tolerate and appreciate differences. As you move forward in your relationship, you will find that there are some ways in which you and your partner are fundamentally different. Maybe your partner is a neat freak while you’re messy; maybe you’re really social while they are more on the shy side. Though you can change a bit to suit each other, you can’t change completely, and you have to learn to accept and appreciate your differences if you want to truly respect your partner.[2]\n\nOf course, if you’re super messy and your partner is a neat freak, then you’ll have to be respectful of their boundaries and keep your part of the home clean, though you may not be able to reach their standards.\nIf there are certain things about your partner that bother you that you know you won’t be able to change, such as their obsession with their dog, then you have to be respectful and learn to live with them if you want to continue a healthy relationship.",
            "Acknowledge your partner’s contributions. In order to respect your partner, you have to let them know when they are doing things right. You can’t spend all of your time nagging them or being negative about all of the problems you see or you won’t be able to be happy together; whether your partner cheered you up when you were having a rough day, cooks amazing meals for you, or is always kind and attentive, take the time to truly let your partner know how much they mean to you.\n\n\nThis can mean that saying “thank you” and being specific, writing them a love note, or just taking the time to acknowledge positive behavior.\nIf you never acknowledge all of the nice things your partner does for you, then they’ll see it as a sign of disrespect because it’ll look like you’re taking them for granted.",
            "Have self-respect. Respecting yourself builds the foundation for a good relationship and life in general. Treat your body with care, avoid any behavior that makes you lose respect for yourself, such as abusing alcohol or being rude to strangers, and work on being the best possible version of yourself. If you don’t have that baseline, then it can be difficult for you to respect your partner, and you may fall prey to people who don't respect you.\n\n\nWork on caring for yourself. As a rule of thumb, ask yourself if you would treat a best friend that way, e.g. “Would I tell my best friend that she's a failure?” If not, don't say or do it to yourself. Become your own best friend.",
            "Learn to compromise. Another way to respect your partner is to be able to compromise on the things you disagree about. When you’re making a decision together, the most important thing is that you both first listen to each other and make sure you understand exactly where the other person stands on the issue. Then, you should be able to discuss the pros and cons of the situation in a respectful manner and to find a resolution that can make both of you as happy as possible.\n\n\nWhen it comes to compromising, you may find that it’s better to be happy than to be right. Learn how to pick your battles and decide when it’s better to let your partner get what they want; when you really want something, though, then you can ask for it.\nWhen it comes to making smaller decisions, such as where to eat, you may be better off just taking turns.",
            "Practice mutual accountability. If you and your partner want to respect each other, then you have to practice mutual accountability. This means more than just apologizing when you’re wrong, but being aware of all the times when you disrespect your partner, while knowing that your partner is aware of the large and small ways that she disrespects you, too. As long as you’re both self-aware and understand what it means to disrespect each other and are willing to be accountable for your actions, then you have a long and healthy relationship ahead.\n\n\nFor example, if you came home two hours late without calling when you knew your wife was excited for a date night at home, you can expect that you disrespected your partner and should be accountable for what you did.\nFor example, if your partner invited a friend to join you to an event that was supposed to be a date, then she should feel accountable for the way she disrespected you, too.\nAs long as you both have little checks and balances in your relationship and are comfortable discussing your mistakes, you’ll be headed in the right direction.",
            "Apologize when you’ve made a mistake. One way to respect your partner is to apologize when you’ve truly messed up. Instead of being in denial or trying to brush it under the rug, the best thing you can do is to say you’re truly sorry and to not only say those words, but to mean them. Look your partner in the eye, put away your phone, and make it clear how much you regret what happened and how badly you want to make it up to your partner.\n\n\nDon’t just say, “I’m sorry you feel that I…” or “I’m sorry you got so mad when I…” instead, really take responsibility for your actions and make it clear that you know you’re in the wrong.\nOf course, actions speak louder than words. You should not only say you’re sorry, but make a real effort not to do whatever you did again.",
            "Practice putting yourself in your partner’s shoes. Another way to be considerate and to show real respect to your partner is to think about where they are coming from whenever you have an argument, or just when you’re making a decision. For example, if you know her father is in the hospital, you should think about what she’s going through before starting a fight about doing the dishes. If your ex boyfriend is in town and your current boyfriend is less than pleased that you want to meet him for a drink, think about how you’d feel if he wanted to meet up with an ex.\n\n\nMaking a regular effort to think about your partner’s perspective before you start a conversation or have an argument can really help you develop more respect for your partner.\nTrying to put yourself in another person’s shoes is a great way of showing someone respect, whether it’s your best friend or your boyfriend.",
            "Take the time to truly listen to your partner. Listening is a skill that many people lack in today’s world of multi-tasking and obsession with technology. If you want to show your partner true respect, then you should make an effort to truly listen to them when they are talking to you. This doesn’t mean interrupting, offering advice when you aren’t asked, or waiting for your turn to speak, but truly taking the time to pay attention to the things your partner is saying to you and appreciating their thoughts, experiences, and ideas.\n\n\nPut your phone away, make eye contact, and stop looking around the room to see what else is going on; give your partner your full attention when they talk to you.\nYou can practice active listening, too. You can repeat what your partner said to show that you’re really listening, making sure to put it in your own words to show that you really understand. You can say something like, “I see that you’re frustrated because your boss doesn’t appreciate you…” to show your partner you really do pay attention.\nYou don’t have to nod emphatically or say, “I know,” every two seconds to show you’re paying attention. The words you use after your partner is done talking will show that you’re listening.",
            "Respect your partner’s boundaries. Everyone has their own boundaries, and if you want to truly respect your partner, then you have to know what theirs are and be willing to respect them. Maybe your partner is really private and hates it when you look through old photos of him or talk about his past in front of others; maybe she really doesn’t like it when you tease her about how she was overweight as a child. Whatever those boundaries are, you have to recognize them and be caring and respectful enough to respect them.\n\n\nRespecting your partner’s privacy is crucial to a successful relationship. Don’t think that you have the right to snoop through your partner’s phone or computer just because you’re dating.\nYou should also respect your partner’s things. If he really doesn’t like it when you borrow his favorite watch, you have to understand that.\nIf you think your partner has a boundary you have a hard time dealing with, such as not discussing her ex-husband, have a respectful conversation about why she feels this way.",
            "Encourage your partner to reach their full potential. If you want to respect your partner, then you should want only the best for them. You should be there to help your partner reach his full potential and to realize their dreams. You should be there to tell your partner she’s going to do great before a job interview, that he’s going to break his personal record during his next marathon, and that they are capable of finishing that novel they started five years ago.\n\n\nYou shouldn’t put your partner down or make them feel like they can’t reach for their dreams. If you have real reasons for why you think certain goals are not a good idea, then you should have an amicable discussion about it.\nTo have a truly successful relationship, you and your partner have to be better together than apart. You should care for your partner and encourage them to be better than they are.\nIf your partner reaching their full potential is in conflict with you reaching yours, then you shouldn’t be mean about it, but should have a discussion about what it means.",
            "Be compassionate. Compassion is key when it comes to having a successful relationship and showing respect to your partner. If you really care for them, then you have to be able to show love and forgiveness for them, especially when they’re going through a hard time. You have to be able to see that they have their own struggles and that you can’t ignore their feelings just because they’re not doing exactly what you want them to do.\n\n\nWhen your partner really needs you, make sure to give them love and affection. Though you can’t feel sorry or sad for them all the time and anyone’s patience has its limits, make sure you show compassion to your partner when they really need it.",
            "Be honest. If you want to be considerate and to respect your partner, then you have to be honest with them above all else. Don’t be dishonest about where you went last night, and don’t do anything that would make them distrust you. Though you may not feel comfortable revealing everything about yourself and there are some things about your life you’d like to keep private, you should avoid lying to your partner’s face as much as you can. If they find out that you’ve broken their trust, it will be pretty difficult to get it back.\n\n\nOf course, there are times when a little white lie can’t hurt. But if you get in the habit of lying to your partner, then that is showing a major lack of respect.",
            "Give your partner space. Another way to respect your partner is to give them space when they need it. If your partner wants to be alone or to do their own thing for a while, it’s actually not very respectful to disregard that, hold it against them, or barge in. Everyone needs time apart and it’s healthy and normal for people in a relationship to maintain their independence; if you can’t understand why your partner would rather be alone than with you, sometimes, then you’re not being very respectful.\n\n\nDon’t think that when your partner wants to be alone, that it has something to do with you. You have to understand that some people just need privacy to regroup and to be respectful of that boundary.\nIf their frequent alone time is becoming stressful to you, try taking them aside to talk about it. Phrase it in a non-accusatory manner, such as \"I feel that we haven't been spending much time together and I really miss being with you.\"",
            "Don’t demean your partner in public. One way to majorly disrespect your partner is to be mean or to criticize them in public, especially in front of your friends and family members. You should look at each other as a team; if you have any issues with them, you should raise them in the privacy of your own home, not in front of other people. Saying mean things to them in front of others or snapping at them in public will make them feel terrible and resent you, and it will make your friends and family uncomfortable.\n\n\nIf you do snap at your partner in public, make sure you apologize. Not everyone can keep their cool all the time.\nInstead of calling your partner names or demeaning them in public, try casually praising them and make them feel better in front of others.",
            "Don’t say terrible things about your partner to your friends. Along the same lines, you shouldn’t tell your friends and family all of your dirty secrets or complain about the fifty most annoying things your partner does. Though you can come to your loved ones for advice when you’re really struggling, if you get in the habit of bad mouthing your partner to others all the time, then it will make both them and your relationship look bad.\n\n\nIf you’re demeaning them when they aren’t not around, it shows that you don’t respect them very much.\nThink about it: how would you feel if your partner was always saying terrible things about you to their friends? That would feel like major disrespect towards you, wouldn’t it?",
            "Don’t talk about members of the opposite sex in a disrespectful manner. Another way to show your partner major disrespect is to talk about members of the opposite sex in a disrespectful manner. Okay, so we’re all human and we can’t stop appreciating other beautiful people even when we’re madly in love; that said, if you go around talking about all the “hot girls” or “cute guys” you see, then yeah, this is bound to make your partner feel bad and is a major sign of disrespect towards them. This is especially disrespectful if you do it in front of your partner and your friends; it shows that you don’t really take your relationship seriously.\n\n\nOf course, some people are much more sensitive about this kind of thing than others, but you should still avoid it as a rule.\nWhen your partner isn’t around, you shouldn’t talk about all of the hot guys or girls in your orbit in front of your friends, either. Okay, so you don’t have to completely ignore the fact that there are other attractive people on the planet, but if you keep talking about it, then your friends will think you don’t really respect your partner.",
            "Don’t wait until your feelings reach a boiling point. If you really respect your partner, then you shouldn’t let your feelings fester until all you can do is start yelling at them. If something is really bothering you, then you should give your partner the basic respect of wanting to sit down and have a serious conversation about it. Don’t just wait for your partner to guess what’s bothering you or bring it up when you’re out in public or just can’t take it anymore; that’s not very respectful toward your partner or your relationship.\n\n\nIf you don’t really talk about the things that are bothering you, then you’re likely to be passive aggressive toward your partner, which is also not very respectful.\nEven if you’re having a really busy week, you should make time to talk about something if it’s really bothering you; if your partner were angry with you, you would want to know too, wouldn’t you?",
            "Don’t take your partner for granted. Remember the sweet things that they do for you, and how much you appreciate them. This helps your attitude and shows that your relationship has had a positive impact on your life. Work on making loving choices, and showing them how much you care every single day.\n\n\nYou may not even realize that you’ve been taking your partner for granted until you sit back and realize that you can’t even remember the last time you said a kind word to them or said “I love you.” Make sure that your partner knows exactly how much you care for them, no matter how busy you are."

        "intro": "Green onions are so versatile that you can grow them in almost any location. Whether you have a spacious yard, a tiny deck or simply a sunny window, you can grow green onions. Start growing your own green onions and enjoy the fresh, pungent flavor of onion in your salads, soups and casseroles.",
        "steps": [
            "Choose a type of onion to grow. Green onions, or scallions, are the green shoots that come up before an onion bulb begins to form. They are essentially immature onions. Look for a hearty scallion seed, such as the species A. Welsh onions, or simply choose your favorite white, red or yellow onion to grow.[1]\n\nIf you'd prefer not to start the green onions from seed, choose red, white or onion \"sets\" to plant. These look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands. You can pick up a few sets to use as scallions, and let the others mature into onion bulbs.[2]",
            "Prepare a planting bed. Choose a spot in your yard or garden that gets full sun and has soil that drains well. Till the dirt to a depth of 12 inches and work in compost, blood meal or another organic material to enrich the soil with nutrients. This will ensure that the green onions grow strong and healthy, and continue to produce shoots throughout the growing season.\n\n\nBe sure rocks, sticks and weeds are cleared away before you till and work the soil.\nYou can till the soil using a garden rake if you're working with a small patch. For a bigger area, buy or rent a soil tiller to make the job easier.\nIf you just want a few green onions, you can prepare a pot with a compost-rich potting soil instead of planting them in the ground.",
            "Plant the seeds or sets. As soon as the soil is workable, about four weeks before the last frost, it's time to plant the seeds or sets you have ready. If you have seeds, sow them thickly about 1/2 inch deep in rows spaced 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. If you have sets, plant them root-side down 2 inches apart and 1 inch deep, in rows 1 foot (0.3 m) apart. Water the garden bed thoroughly.\n\n\nThe onion seeds will germinate when the soil is anywhere between 65 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 to 30 degrees Celsius). It may take up to a month for onion seeds to germinate.\nIf you live in a cold climate with a late spring, you can start the seeds indoors about eight weeks before the last frost. Plant the seeds in peat seed starter pots and keep them well-watered. Put them in a warm, sunny room to during the germination period. When the ground outside is warm enough to work with, transplant the seedlings to the garden or a larger pot.",
            "Thin the plants if necessary. When the first green shoots begin poking up, determine whether to thin them to give them each a bit more room. Green onions grow well in bunches, but for best results the mature plants should be spaced 2 to 3 inches apart. Take a look at your garden bed and remove weaker seedlings if necessary.",
            "Mulch between the seedlings. Cover the soil around the seedlings with grass clippings, pine straw or fine pieces of bark. This will prevent weeds from growing and keep the soil evenly moist.\n\n\nIf you're growing your green onions in a pot, you can skip this step, since weeds won't be an issue and you can more easily control the moisture level.",
            "Keep them well watered. Green onions need evenly moist soil throughout the growing season. Provide the onion plants with about 1 inch of water per week. For optimal plant growth, the soil does not need to be soggy, but it should be moist. Water the garden bed every few days, or when it begins to look dry and dusty.\n\n\nAnother way to determine whether the onions need watering is to test the soil conditions. Insert your finger, up to the second knuckle, in the soil close to where the plant is. If you feel that the soil is dry, water it. If you think the soil is wet enough, don't worry about watering, and repeat the test again in a few days. If your area has received rain recently, you may not need to water.",
            "Harvest the green onions when they have matured. After three to four weeks, the green shoots will be 6 to 8 inches long and ready to eat. Harvest them by pulling the entire plant from the ground. The plant will not yet have formed a bulb. Both the white and green parts of the onion are flavorful.\n\n\nIf you want to let some of the plants mature into storage onions, simply leave them in the ground. The bottom of the plants will begin to form a bulb, which will be ready for harvest in the fall.\nIf you only want to use the green part of the onions, and not the white part close to the roots, you can use a pair of scissors to simply cut off the green tops. Leave an inch or two of growth. The onions will continue to grow, and you can harvest the greens again once they're 6 to 8 inches long. Note that they will become stronger-tasting as the plant matures.",
            "Pick out onion sets to grow. Choose red, white or onion \"sets\" to plant. Available at your local nursery, these look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands.[3] Any type of onion sets will make excellent green onions, and they all grow well in pots indoors.",
            "Prepare a pot with rich potting soil. Green onions grow best in very rich soil, so choose a potting soil that has been enriched with compost - or mix in your own compost with standard potting soil. Fill the pot to within a few inches of the top. Water the soil to prepare it for planting. Be sure the pot you use drains well, so that the soil never gets waterlogged.",
            "Plant the sets. Plant each onion 1 inch deep, pointing the root side down. Gently pat soil over the top. Space them 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart to allow them a little room to form roots without crowding each other. Water the onions and place the pot in your sunniest window.\n\n\nYou can grow green onions indoors any time of year, as long as you maintain the correct conditions. The onions need full sun, so they should be placed in a window that receives light for most of the day. Be sure the temperature never drops below freezing.\nKeep the soil evenly moist. Water every few days, or when the soil seems to be getting dry. Don't overwater the onions, though - the soil should be moist, but never soggy.",
            "Harvest the greens when they're 6 to 8 inches tall. After a few weeks, the green tops will emerge and grow. Either pull the plants from the pots to use the whites and greens, or use a scissors to trim off the green tops and leave the bulb to continue growing. If you leave the bulb in the pot, you should get at least one more harvest before it stops producing.[4]",
            "Save your green onion bulbs. Next time you buy green onions to use in a recipe, save the white part with roots and eat only the greens. You can grow more green onions using only the leftover roots - and next time you want to add flavor to a dish, you'll have your own home-grown green onions on hand.\n\n\nAny green onions bulbs will work, but you might have the best luck if you use green onions that were grown nearby. That way you know they'll grow well in your climate. Try starting with green onions you bought at the farmer's market, since they were probably grown in your region.",
            "Put them root-down in a glass jar. Any type of clean glass jar will do. Just make sure the glass is clear, and not tinted, so that the sun's rays can easily reach the onions inside. Put in as many green onion rots as you'd like - just make sure the roots are facing down, so that the greens grow up and out of the jar.",
            "Add water and sun. Pour in enough water to cover the bulbs entirely. Set the jar in a sunny window and wait for the magic to happen. Within a few days, you should see the roots starting to get longer. Tiny green shoots will emerge from the bulbs and begin growing upward. Keep the jar filled with enough water to cover the white part of the onions.",
            "Harvest the greens. Once they're 4 to 6 inches long, they're ready to harvest. Remove a green onion from the jar and chop off as much as you want - or use the whole thing. If you just need a handful of chopped scallion, you can return the bulb and roots to the jar to continue growing. You should be able to harvest the same onions two to three times before they stop growing.[5]\n\nIf you want to continue growing onions year round, then put some rocks and pebbles in the bottom of the jar. Then, place soil over the rocks and pebbles and plant the bulbs in the soil."

    "wikiHow to Use Self Hypnosis to Quit Smoking": {
        "intro": "Quitting smoking can be incredibly difficult, but it’s a good decision for your health. If you have tried other methods to stop smoking and they haven’t worked, self-hypnosis could be an option for you. Some people respond to hypnotic suggestion and some don’t, but hypnosis may be able to help you relax, manage anxiety, and kick your smoking habit for good.",
        "steps": [
            "Understand how hypnosis works. Unlike the myths in popular culture, hypnosis doesn’t render you unconscious, and you cannot be forced to do anything against your will while under hypnosis.\n\n\nHypnosis first encourages you to relax. Relaxation is often achieved by deep breathing and visualization exercises. If a trained hypnotherapist is helping you, they may speak very softly and slowly to you. If you are on your own, you may find a hypnosis CD or soundtrack with relaxing noises helpful.[1]\n\nOnce relaxed, hypnosis provides statements and suggestions to help you change your behavior. It is thought that the hypnotic state makes you more receptive to embracing suggestions.[2]\n\nHypnosis helps you achieve focus. While in a hypnotic state, ideally you will focus only on the goal that you want to accomplish. This enhanced focus can help you accept the suggestions and prepare you to work for your goal.[3]",
            "Explore your own mental state. Hypnosis can’t make you do something you don’t want to do. It cannot give you a “secret password” that makes you never want to smoke again. It can, however, help you focus, concentrate, and change your behaviors.\n\n\nHypnosis works best for people who are suggestible. If your personality is very resistant to new ideas or changes, or if you find it difficult to suspend disbelief, hypnosis may not be a good fit for you.\nHypnosis relies on your own belief that the treatment will work. Hypnosis will only help you make changes that you actually want to make.[4] For self-hypnosis to help you, you must be committed to quitting smoking.",
            "Find a quiet, private space to practice self-hypnosis. Ideally, it should be free of all distractions: no TV, no cell-phones, no other people. You should feel comfortable and relaxed in this location.\n\n\nIf you can, avoid lying on a bed, as you may end up falling asleep instead of entering a hypnotic state. A comfortable chair or recliner may be more helpful to keep you relaxed but awake.",
            "Create affirmations for yourself. Hypnosis may be more effective if the suggestions you use are direct statements, rather than abstract questions. Rather than asking yourself something like “Why do I smoke?” consider using statements such as “Smoking harms me. I do not want to harm myself.”[5] Write them down and keep them.\n\n\nTry to keep your affirmations reasonable. A statement such as “It will be easy to quit smoking” or “I will never want to smoke again” may not be very effective. Instead, consider something like “I respect my body and will not damage it by smoking.”[6]\n\nAffirmations that are phrased in the present tense, such as “I do not want to smoke,” may be more helpful to you as they keep your attention on what is happening at the present moment.",
            "Accept that self-hypnosis may take some time. Most people are not immediately skilled at self-hypnosis. Even if the technique does work for you, it may take quite some time for you to become fully comfortable practicing self-hypnosis. Stay patient with yourself and keep trying.",
            "Commit to consistency. While some people can stop smoking after only one session with a clinical hypnotist, for most people it may take several sessions for the technique to work.[7] This is doubly true if you are practicing self-hypnosis, as you may need to experiment and practice before you are able to effectively use it.",
            "Understand when to see a professional. While many people have found self-hypnosis useful for helping them quit smoking, it may not work for everyone. Sometimes, seeing a trained clinical hypnotherapist can help even if self-hypnosis has not worked for you.\n\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Hypnosis maintains a database of certified professional hypnotherapists. It is highly recommended that you visit a professional, as clinical hypnosis requires training to be administered safely and effectively.",
            "Prepare yourself for self-hypnosis. Go to the private, quiet space you previously identified. Sit and make yourself comfortable.\n\n\nEliminate as many distractions as possible. Wear comfortable clothing, don’t eat a heavy meal just beforehand, and schedule your self-hypnosis at a time when you know you’re unlikely to be interrupted.[8] If you live with others, ask them not to disturb you for a little while.",
            "Focus your attention on a particular spot in the room. This should preferably be a wall or a ceiling that does not have distracting details. Take long, deep, slow breaths, breathing in through your nostrils and breathing out through your mouth.",
            "Think about feeling tired and heavy. Silently repeat to yourself that your eyes want to close, and that you want to relax. Close your eyes. Keep breathing deeply.",
            "Relax your body. We often hold a lot of tension in our bodies that we’re not even aware of. Allow your body to completely relax, becoming loose and heavy in the chair.\n\n\nContinue to breathe deeply, allowing your attention to focus on the movement of your chest, lungs, and diaphragm.\nIf you have trouble relaxing, simply continue your deep breathing and try not to focus too much on the fact that you’re having trouble. The more you focus on not relaxing, the more stressed you may become.",
            "Repeat your affirmations to yourself. Use a soothing, soft tone of voice as you repeat your affirmations. Don’t be harsh or angry toward yourself. Hypnosis is more likely to work if you are positive about the process.",
            "Visualize an image that represents your goal. This image should be positive and represent you achieving your objective. Perhaps you could visualize yourself running a marathon without running out of breath, or perhaps you could picture yourself surrounded by your friends and family who are proud of your achievement.\n\n\nWhile focusing on this visualization, repeat your affirmations to yourself. Continue this for about 30 seconds.",
            "Return from the hypnotic state. Once you have completed your affirmations, tell yourself that you are coming out of your relaxed state. You are becoming light and energetic, and returning to your surroundings. Count from 1 to 5, then open your eyes. Stretch and take a few deep breaths.",
            "Repeat this process consistently. Ideally, you will be able to practice self-hypnosis every day. Even if that isn’t possible, try to be consistent with your sessions and practice at least a few times a week.",
            "Remain patient with yourself. You may experience some difficulty with self-hypnosis techniques at first. You may even find that self-hypnosis is not effective for you to stop smoking. Be accepting and kind toward yourself, and don’t focus on the negative."

If you want to know how to keep your wife happy, just follow these steps. They may help you out and give you a better chance in your relationship.",
        "steps": [
            "Always make time for date night. No matter how busy you may be, you should always make time for a date night with your wife, ideally once a week or at least twice a month. If you spend all of your precious time together hanging out with friends or just lounging around the house, then you'll forget that spark that makes your relationship so special.\n\n\nMix it up. Do something different during every date night, whether it's checking out a new movie or going to a restaurant you've never been to before.\nIf you're staying in to cook, dress up just as nicely as you would if you were going out.\nMake time to talk. Activities like mini-golfing or watching movies are great, but make sure there's a portion of the evening when you have time to just look into each other's eyes and talk.\nGive your wife a card that tells her how much you love her during date night, even if there's no special occasion. Every occasion with your wife should be special.",
            "Maintain your appearance. Though it's tempting to let your scruff grow and to lounge around the house in your workout clothes, you should try to be presentable at all times and work to maintain your handsome looks. If you two don't care how you look anymore, then you're slacking in the romance department.\n\n\nUnless you're rocking a beard or some scruff, make sure to shave every day and to keep your face smooth.\nTake a shower every day and continue to smell fresh. Don't let hygiene get in the way of you and your wife.\nEven if you're just hanging out around the house, make an effort to wear clean and matching clothes.\nOf course, you can't look amazing every day. You and your wife can decide on a more casual day, such as Sunday, when you can wear whatever you want, but don't let your old ratty sweatpants become the standard.",
            "Make time for romantic getaways. Though a romantic vacation is not a long-term solution for any problems in the romance department, taking a short getaway is a perfect way to spend time with your wife in a fresh environment and to learn to appreciate your relationship even more.\n\n\nMake a goal of going away somewhere exotic together at least once a year, if your budget allows for it. Book your trip well in advance so when the time comes, you can't say you're too busy as an excuse.\nTry to go to a new place every time. Not only will this keep your romance fresh, but it will also strengthen your bond when you explore the world together.\nIf your budget is really tight or if it's difficult for you to find a sitter, have a goal of at least going away from the weekend together from time to time even if you're only going an hour's drive away or just checking into a hotel in the closest city.",
            "Maintain a romantic atmosphere at home. You can still make room for romance even if you're just sitting around the house. Though it may feel impossible to create a romantic atmosphere when your house is cluttered with dirty dishes and toys, there are a few things you can do to make your time at home feel more romantic.\n\n\nBring roses or other flowers home to your wife once a week and put them in a bouquet on the dining room table.\nIf the two of you are just having a normal dinner or watching TV, dim the lights and light a few candles.\nIf you're just engaged in a quiet conversation, turn up some jazz or romantic music.\nTry to keep the house as clean as possible, so you'll feel more relaxed and happy in your own environment.\nMake your bedroom a sex sanctuary. No matter how cluttered the rest of the house may be, you should keep your bedroom clean, neat, and smelling fresh at all times. Don't use your bedroom as an office or a place to throw your dirty laundry.",
            "Always show love and affection. If you want to maintain romance in your relationship, you should never take your wife for granted. Though you know you love her, and she should know how you feel, you still have to take the time to tell her how much you value your relationship. She's a wife, not a psychic.\n\n\nTell your wife that you love her every single day. No matter what.\nTake the time to not only tell your wife you love her, but tell her why you love and appreciate her so much. Remind her why she's special.\nDon't just be affectionate in the bedroom. Take the time to hug, caress, and kiss your wife as often as you can.\nIf you're leaving the house while she's away or still asleep, leave a post-it note that tells her how much you love her and wish her a good day.",
            "Stay honest and open. Honest communication is the key to any long and stable relationship. If you want to keep your wife happy, then you should always share your feelings and be happy to listen to what she has to say. You should feel comfortable sharing your feelings with your wife and being open about your thoughts, even if you have a hard time expressing them.\n\n\nIf there's something on your mind, say it. Don't deal with a difficult situation alone.\nIf you're upset about something your wife did, bring it up. It's better to talk about your feelings than to be passive-aggressive.\nIf your wife asks you about your honest opinion about a new outfit or haircut, don't be a fool and say she's looked better -- just tell her she looks beautiful no matter what. She obviously just wants you to confirm that she thinks she looks great.\nTime your honesty. If you have something important to say to your wife, do it when she's relatively stress-free and can give you her time and energy.\nYou may be worried over a recent flirtation with a colleague at work, but you should tell her the truth, not deal with it on your own. Open, honest communication is the key to a relationship. Your wife is your partner in life and deserves to know the whole truth about you and your activities.",
            "Continue to compromise. Compromising is a major part of strong communication. You should be able to compromise and to make decisions as a unit instead of always looking out for yourself. You should work on being able to discuss an important decision and finding a resolution that will make you both happy.\n\n\nFirst, take time to listen. Each of you should say why your opinion is important to you and what it would mean to make the decision.\nBe thoughtful. You can even make a list of pros and cons when you're making a decision together.\nTake turns compromising. Sometimes a decision will only make one person happy (such as choosing to live in one city over another), but the next time a big decision comes, make sure the other person gets his way.\nMake sure both people are actually compromising. Don't guilt your wife into always doing what you want because you'll be so upset if you don't get your way.",
            "Learn to give and accept an apology. If you really want to make your wife happy, then you should know that being happy is much more important than being right. You need to swallow your pride and step up if you've made a mistake, and be reasonable enough to accept your wife's apology if she is the one who erred.\n\n\nWhen you apologize, be sincere. Maintain eye contact and let your wife know that you're really sorry. She won't accept your apology if you sound like you're just doing it because you don't have a choice.\nLearn to accept an apology. You can still be mad, but make it clear that you do accept your wife's apology even though you need some time to cool off.",

If you want to keep your wife happy, then take the time to work out with her or to just get some mild exercise together at least once a week.\n\n\nTrain for a race together. This is a great goal that will bring you closer together as a couple, whether you're training for a 5K or a marathon.\nTake a dance class together. This will not only boost the romance factor, but you'll have a great time learning something new while shedding pounds.\nGo to a circuit gym together. You can keep up a conversation while burning calories.\nIf you're both not workout-aholics, take a twenty-minute walk together a few days a week, whether it's in the morning before breakfast or after dinner.",

You don't have to take a trip to the sex store to maintain and exciting and rewarding sex life.\n\n\nMake sure that you're making love at least once a week, no matter how busy you are.\nTry to make love at a different time each day. If you only have sex in the mornings or on Wednesday evenings, your sex will feel like just another part of your routine.\nBe adventurous. Don't be afraid to make love in new positions or in new places.\nDon't forget to cuddle with your wife after sex and to tell her how much you love her.",
            "Be active around the house together. Though chores are no fun, you can have more fun with your wife if you're active around the house together instead of taking turns doing what needs to be done. This will bring you even closer together.\n\n\nIf you need to fix the roof, make sure your wife is near you on the ground so you can talk while you get things done.\nIf you have a garden, try planting something together. Who says gardening is woman's work?\nSpring-clean the house together. Don't let your wife do all the cleaning.\nPaint a new room of the house together. This is a great way to have fun and improve your home's appearance.",
            "Be a father, not a babysitter. If you're lucky enough to have kids, then you should try to spend as much time with them as you can, instead of waiting for your wife to get tired and then taking over. Your wife loves your kids, but she would love it if you helped out as much as you could.\n\n\nYou don't have to take turns with the kids, either. You can cement your bond by taking the kids to the park or having a family movie night together.\nIf you work while your wife stays at home with the kids, try to make as much time as you can to see them when you're home.\nPick some weekends when you hang out with the kids to give your wife some time to rest. Motherhood is a beautiful thing, but it's also exhausting.",
            "Give her some space. Part of keeping your wife happy means giving her some time to herself. Though it may seem nearly impossible to give her some space when your lives are so entwined, letting her do her own thing once in a while will make you appreciate each other even more.\n\n\nLet her visit her family without you from time to time. You don't have to be there at every single family event -- unless she insists.\nLet her have a girls' night with her friends once in a while. You don't have to be there at every social event, either.\nLet her pursue her own hobbies and interests. You don't have to do all of the same sports, love all of the same television shows, or read all of the same books.",
            "Understand the difficulties of her career or occupation. Take the time to talk to your wife about her career and give her advice when necessary. Remember how hard it is to be a wife, a mother, and a career woman all at the same time.\n\n\nLet your wife vent about her job from time to time. She needs your love and support.\nIf she's having a tough week at work, you should make her lunch or drop in with some coffee, and take over the chores at home for a little while.\nIf she's a stay-at-home mom, remember that this is a full-time job too, and not an easy one.

In most cases, though, you can expect:[4]\n\nSmall sizes to range between 20 and 26 in (50.8 and 66 cm).\nMedium sizes to range between 26 and 32 in (66 and 81.3 cm).\nLarge sizes to range between 32 and 38 in (81.3 and 96.5 cm).\nXL sizes to range between 38 and 44 in (96.5 and 111.8 cm).\nCups generally have four sizes also: peewee (ages 5-7), youth (ages 8-12), teen (13-15) and adult (age 16 and above).[5]",
            "Substitute athletic briefs for a jock, alternatively. Everyone's body is different, and it's possible that a jockstrap might not be comfortable for you If this is the case for you, the athletic brief is an excellent substitute that's more similar to conventional underwear.\n\n\nNot all athletic briefs come with cups. If you are playing a sport that requires a groin protector, be sure you purchase a pair that comes with a cup.",
            "Wear jockstraps without a cup for running intensive activities. Though a protective cup is sometimes required for certain activities, cups can chafe, cause heat to build up more than usual, and can sometimes be uncomfortably bulky. Activities like track and field, basketball, rollerblading, and so on, are better suited to cup-less jocks.[6]",
            "Prioritize cups for projectile/ball activities. Projectiles, like balls, pucks, and so on, can pick up a great deal of speed. These projectiles can become deadly to the more delicate parts of your body, especially your genitals. Wear a jockstrap with a cup for sports like:\n\n\nBaseball\nFootball\nHockey\nSoccer\nRugby[7]",
            "Choose between styles of cup. Cups are made out of hard plastic or metal, and have small holes in the cup material for ventilation. For low contact activities where you still want some protection, you might use a soft cup or flex cup, which are more comfortable. Depending on the jockstrap you buy, you'll likely have two styles of cup to choose from:\n\n\nThe traditional protective cup is an upside down pear shaped, hollow, plastic cover. This style is ideal for most genital sizes and shapes.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 9Bullet1\" src=\"http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/43/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-9Bullet1.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nThe banana cup has a longer up-and-down shape than the traditional cup. This style is most suitable for larger genitalia, especially genitals that are longer than average.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 9Bullet2\" src=\"http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-9Bullet2.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
            "Layer your undergarments. The more layers of undergarment you wear, the more support you'll receive. Athletes will often wear more than one pair of undergarment for precisely this purpose. For example, for extra support you might:\n\n\nWear a pair of compression shorts under your jockstrap and a cup too, if necessary.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 10Bullet1\" src=\"http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/01/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-10Bullet1.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nWear a pair of snug, but still comfortable, briefs or athletic trunks underneath your jockstrap.[8]\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 10Bullet2\" src=\"http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/1/1e/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-10Bullet2.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-10Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">",
            "Choose narrower protective cups for young kids. Children, not having gone through puberty yet, will not need as much space in their protective cup. Children can also be more prone to clothing irritation or discomfort, like what might be experienced with a cup. A narrow cup will be less bulky and more comfortable.[9]",
            "Utilize specialized jocks for sports specific purposes. There are many examples of specialized jockstraps, and one of the best examples of this comes from hockey. Because hockey players wear so much padding to keep warm and protect themselves from damaging hockey pucks, hockey jocks often have special clips or garters to help hold up socks and keep your gear tight to your body. Two common other varieties of jock include.\n\n\nSwim jocks, which generally have a narrower waistband than traditional kinds of jockstrap.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 12Bullet1\" src=\"http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-12Bullet1.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nWindproof jocks, which include a layer of cloth or fabric to provide additional protection against wind and cold in winter sports.[10]\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Buy a Jockstrap Step 12Bullet2\" src=\"http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ed/Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-12Bullet2.jpg/aid1998474-v4-728px-Buy-a-Jockstrap-Step-12Bullet2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">"

    "wikiHow to Exercise Your Rabbit": {
        "intro": "Rabbits are inquisitive and energetic pets. They need regular exercise to keep them from getting bored and restless. If you have a rabbit, make sure you give it the time and space to run around and explore to stay active and healthy. Plus, exercising is a great way for you to spend time and bond with your furry friend. An active rabbit is a happy rabbit, and one who will enjoy spending time with you.",
        "steps": [
            "Play tag. Rabbits like to run around, including after people. If your rabbit is coming towards you, turn and run away so it will chase you. Then, turn around and start chasing your rabbit so it can run away in the other direction. You can turn around again to make your rabbit the pursuer once more.[1]\n\nIt may take a few times for your rabbit to figure out what you are doing, but once it learns that this is just a game, it’s a great way to get some running exercise.\nIt can be good to crawl while doing this. Being closer to the ground will help your rabbit get comfortable with you.",
            "Hold treats out for your rabbit to reach. This is good to get your rabbit to stretch out different parts of its body. Make sure the food is just out of regular reach so your rabbit has to really extend to get there.[2]\n\nHold a treat in your hand in the air above your rabbit’s head. Make sure it has to stand up and stretch to get there.\nPut your rabbit on a box or table, and either hold or place a treat just off the edge. Your rabbit will need to stretch its neck to get there. Just make sure your rabbit doesn’t slip or fall off the edge.",
            "Play fetch. Unlike with a dog, you will be the one doing the chasing here. Give your rabbit a toy and let it toss the toy in the air. Chase down the toy, and return it to your rabbit.[3][4]",
            "Hide food. Take some small treats or pellets and hide them somewhere your rabbit likes to explore. It will smell the food, and try to hunt down a treat.[5] Alternatively, you can put some raisins into a small paper bag, and let your rabbit dig around the bag to find them.[6]",
            "Create a digging box. Rabbits love to dig around. Take a large cat litterbox, or something of similar size, and layer the bottom with newspapers. Put some crumpled up newspapers on top to encourage digging. Your rabbit will enjoy shredding and tearing apart the newspaper.[7]\n\nBy rummaging around in newspaper, your rabbit will probably get ink on its nose, paws, and other parts of its body. Don’t worry, the ink is nontoxic, so your rabbit will be just fine.",
            "Train your rabbit to follow commands. Rabbits are intelligent creatures, and are quite easy to train. Think about commands you want your rabbit to follow, and create steps for it to accomplish them. Reward good behavior with praise and a treat, but just be sure the rabbit doesn’t do something else first, or else you will be rewarding the wrong behavior.\n\n\nInclude simple command words, like “Sit” or “Jump,” so your rabbit begins to associate those words with what you want it to do. Once your rabbit is getting the hang of its tricks, start weaning off the treats, so it only follows commands.\nSome good tricks include getting your rabbit to jump up and down onto places like the couch or your lap, running into and around certain parts of its play area, house breaking, or stopping aggressive behavior.\nYou can also use a clicker to reinforce what you are doing. When you provide treats, also click so the rabbit associates the sound with a treat.[8]\n\nMake sure you don’t yell at or hit your rabbit during training. This will only make the rabbit uneasy or scared of you, which you definitely don’t want. Your rabbit should associate your hands with food and affection, and if you hit your rabbit may become more aggressive.[9]",
            "Walk your rabbit on a leash. If you want to take your rabbit out for a bit, attach it in a harness with a leash. Your rabbit will probably resist the harness at first, so make sure you have little delay between putting it on and going for your walk.[10]\n\nLook for H-style harnesses, which you’ll probably find the cat section of the pet store. Don’t use harnesses or collars that go around the neck, as these can cinch the neck and cause injury. Make sure you have a stretchy leash, and don't tug too much while walking, as that is also a good way to hurt your rabbit.\nIn general, rabbits will prefer more unstructured freedom to roam and explore rather than a restricted walk. Still, this can be another way to get your rabbit out for some movement.\nNever leave your rabbit leashed if you are not around. Left alone, your rabbit may chew through the leash, get tangled in it, or be unable to escape a predator.",
            "Give your rabbit 3 hours of free ranging time a day. Rabbits need up to 3 hours a day where they can run about and stretch their legs. If you allow your rabbit the space to roam around your house, this doesn’t need to be structured playtime, which can be easier on your time.[11]",
            "Get on the floor with your rabbit. Rabbits are curious and friendly, and you can do a lot to encourage your pet’s activity by getting down on its level. Get down on the floor with your rabbit and its toys. The rabbit will explore around you, and may even follow you as you roam around your house.[12]",
            "Move your rabbit around. If rabbits are given regular free range, especially indoors, they may get comfortable in particular places and spend too much time relaxing there. If you are worried about your rabbit settling, pick it up and move it to a different part of your house. The rabbit will get a little bit of exercise hopping back to the preferred location.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can confine your rabbit for a few hours, limiting the space it can move around in. That way, when you remove the barriers and let it free, your rabbit will be more likely to explore the parts it couldn’t go before.[13]\n\nYou can also take some of your rabbit’s favorite toys and move them to different areas. Your rabbit will want to track them down, and maybe bring them back where it thinks they belong.",
            "Watch for problems. Just like in humans, rabbits that don’t get exercise will suffer from various health problems. If you notice your rabbit suffering from some of these concerns, you may need to take some time to get your rabbit exercising. You should also consult with your vet to see what else you should do to help your rabbit.[14] Problems include:\n\n\nObesity. Without exercise and a good diet, your rabbit will gain weight, which will add stress to other parts of its body, including the cardiovascular system and the pads of its feet. Your rabbit will even find it difficult to groom itself effectively. Keep an eye on your rabbit’s weight, and make sure it is getting a healthy diet of grass hay and fresh foods.\nBehavioral problems. If your rabbit is not getting enough exercise, it may also become bored and unhealthy. Look out for signs that your rabbit isn’t healthy such as lethargy, aggression, chewing cage bars or its own fur, or destroying parts of its cage.",
            "Leave toys around. Rabbits are curious and playful. While they may not always be interested in toys you have, leaving things around for them to play with will help prevent boredom.[15]\n\nThese don’t need to be fancy toys bought at a pet store. Rabbits can enjoy themselves with untreated wood products, hard plastic baby toys, pine cones, oatmeal boxes, and phone books. Just be prepared for your rabbit to chew those items up.\nYou can move toys around too. When something isn’t where your rabbit expects it to be, it will naturally try to explore and learn more.[16]\n\nAvoid toys made from cherry, redwood, and peach wood, as these materials can be poisonous to rabbits.",
            "Give your rabbit enough space. Rabbits are fast, active animals that like to run and jump around. In the wild, rabbits can run up to 3 miles every day. You probably don’t have 3 miles to give your rabbit, but you want to make sure your rabbit’s secure play area is large enough for it to move around. Ideally, your rabbit run will be at least 8 feet long and 4 wide with some kind of fence or barrier at least 4 feet high.[17]",
            "Create raised platforms. Rabbits need to exercise their legs by jumping on and off raised areas. These don’t need to be complicated things, maybe a box or chair that your rabbit will be able to jump on and off of. Keep these areas near grassy or soft areas for more comfortable landings.[18]\n\nYou can encourage your rabbit to jump up and down on these platforms by placing treats on top of them or back on the ground.[19]",
            "Provide hiding places. Rabbits sometimes need an area where they can feel safe and secure. Your rabbit will also want an area that it can go to get out of wind and rain, or just go if it feels stressed and afraid, or simply wants to be alone. Make sure your shelters are big enough for your rabbit, and try to make more than one entrance if possible.[20]\n\nCardboard or wooden boxes, paper sacks, sections of wide-bore drain pipes, and shelves are all good places for a rabbit to hide.\nIf you have multiple rabbits, make sure you have enough hiding spaces for each individual.",
            "Remove potential hazards from the area. Because of their curiosity and speed, rabbits can easily get themselves into trouble, even if you are watching. Make sure you’ve gotten rid of hazards or other things that can cause harm to your pet.[21]\n\nMake sure the area is sealed off and doesn’t have any small holes, like in a fence, where your rabbit can escape from the area. Outside of a den or other safe space you have set up for it, you don’t want your rabbit to get somewhere you can’t reach.\nRemove house plants and weeds to prevent your rabbit from eating something poisonous.\nBlock off wires with a PVC pipe, or wrap them in electrical tape to prevent nibbling.",
            "Always watch your rabbit. If your rabbits are going to be let loose outside, you need to keep an eye on them at all times. Keep an eye out for possible escape attempts, poisonous items they may try to eat, and any predators that might be lurking nearby.[22]"

        "intro": "Laziness is a nasty affliction that affects everyone from time to time. You may be disinclined to carry out tasks for the day, remain idle, get sidetracked easily, or just lack overall motivation. Laziness is something we all wrestle with but by building up good habits, organizing your priorities, and stop dwelling in negativity, you can jumpstart your life.",
        "steps": [
            "Find reasons to stay active. A major reason for laziness is a lack of motivation. You can be discouraged by a daunting pile of tasks, or a feeling that the challenges of your day simply aren't worth motivating yourself for.[1]\n\nThink of the big picture. It can be easy to get lost in the day-to-day tasks of life and not realize what you're working toward. Take some time out of each day to remind yourself how the task at hand is contributing to larger goals for your life. These can be financial, fitness, or education goals that will help your career and personal life. Make a list of reasons why you want to accomplish tasks before you.",
            "Celebrate success and milestones. You may feel less motivation to do something if it feels insignificant. Stay optimistic and when you complete a task, give yourself a pat on the back. This will also help keep you from being lazy because you are seeing the fruits of your labor.\n\n\nWhether its exercise, school, or work, make sure you have objective, achievable goals along the way. Write them out and check them off when you accomplish them.",
            "Don't beat yourself up. Laziness can be a self-perpetuating cycle. It can be a type of self-loathing. When you are lazy and fail to complete a task, you can sink into a depression that makes you less likely to keep pushing.[2]\n\nIf you keep telling yourself that you are lazy, you'll always be lazy. From now on, stop that kind of internal conversation. Tell yourself repeatedly that you are a man of action. Visualize yourself as a hardworking person finishing all the necessary tasks at hand. Do this every day for 30 days until it becomes a habit.\nMake time for relaxation. There is a tendency to always associate inactivity with laziness. This produces guilt and can perpetuate more laziness. Rather than beat yourself up, allow yourself time to relax with no guilt.[3]",
            "Encourage accountability. Rather than go at everything alone, put yourself in a situation where peers and family can help motivate you. Group accountability is great motivator for staying fit, staying on task, and moving toward goals.\n\n[4]\nIf you're trying to get in better shape, find a gym buddy or an exercise class. It will feel like you are letting others down if you skip and you are more likely to keep at it. If it is a school goal, find a friend in the class that can help you study and stay on track with achieving grades you want.",
            "Recognize that you're procrastinating. Sometimes part of procrastinating is filling our day up with so many side tasks that we have difficulty seeing what we are really doing. Look for useful indicators that your procrastinating that include:[5]\n\nSitting down to do something important and then deciding to get coffee or a snack.\nFilling up your day with low priority tasks.\nRe-reading memos or e-mails many times before deciding what to do with them.",
            "Schedule your day. Many people are inclined to make to-do-lists. However, these can make your day seem daunting and without being tangibly incorporated into your day are little more than wishful aspirations. You need to consider how much time you have and how long each task will take in order to effectively get moving and avoid a day of laziness.[6]\n\nMake sure you actually account for how long tasks will take you. This reduces the chance you will procrastinate because you are working along a tangible schedule. Also, realize that things may come up that alter your schedule. This is okay. All you need to do is add this to the schedule and adjust your day.\nSet boundaries. People who are prone to procrastination should avoid blending life/work boundaries. Assuming you will end each work day at 5:30 P.M. forces you to be productive within a certain timespan.",
            "Do fewer things well. You may procrastinate when you feel like there are too many things to do and you shouldn't bother even starting. Most people believe that they are working harder than they actually are. This is because people feel so overwhelmed and fragmented by endless tasks. We live in a world of constant stimulation and information. Simplify your life and you'll be less likely to be overwhelmed into inactivity.[7]\n\nTry media fasting for a week. Not all the information that we consume everyday from all kind of media is useful. Unless it's required for you to consume certain information for your work, stop everything else for a week. No TV, no newspaper, no social websites, no leisure Internet surfing, no watching videos on the Internet. You might want to create your own rule for this tip.",

It is not important but sooner or later you have to do it. Make it a habit to do it now and you'll stop having an endless list of tasks to do later.\n\n\nThis will be hard at first, but it will help you to build a good habit. The tendency to put things off until later can snowball procrastination and laziness.",
            "Start your day right. Don't hit the snooze on your alarm or go back to sleep but get right out of bed to start your day on the move. You are more likely to get and stay energized by starting your day out active.[8]\n\nThis can take practice to make it a habit. Try placing your alarm clock out of arm's reach. This will insure that you need to actually physically get out of bed before hitting the snooze.",

            "Dab on a tinted moisturizer or a light foundation to your skin. Apply just a few spots with your fingers to your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin, then blend with fingers or a foundation brush, working the spots outwards from the center in all directions.\n\n\nIf you want more coverage, you can use a makeup sponge to apply, using the same blending technique.",
            "Put a little concealer under the eyes. Use a small pointed brush to dot a bit where under-eye circles are darkest, usually at the inner and outer corners of the eye. Add a speck to other blemishes that aren't covered by the foundation and blend into the skin.\n}\n\n\nThere's a little controversy about whether a concealer should be the same shade as your skin or ever-so-slightly lighter; however, it should never be lighter than one shade away from your natural tone. Look for something as close as you can find to your skin tone and err on the lighter side if need be.[2][3]",
            "Set the concealer and moisturizer with a translucent powder. Apply it to your face, ideally using a velvet-y powder puff (as opposed to a powder brush, as that leaves a lot of loose powder) in a pressing motion. Use a powder brush to flick off any excess. If you are using a powder brush to apply, tap off the excess powder before applying to your face in circular motions. [4]",
            "Apply an eyeshadow of your choice to your eyelid. For beginners, try a single neutral shade like taupe or aubergine. Use a rounded shadow brush or your finger and make quick, short swipes across the lid, working your way up to the brow bone.[5]\n\n\nThe shadow should go from your lash line to just beyond the inner crease. From there it fades upward toward the bone.\nSet with a thin dusting of translucent powder.[6]\n\nIf you're using a brush, tap it lightly on the side of the eyeshadow case to remove any excess.[7]",
            "Apply eyeliner. Use a black or brown pencil and apply along the rim of your upper lash line in short strokes.\n\n\nLift your upper lid with one hand and look down into a mirror as you apply with your other hand.[8]\n\nEyeliner is one of the areas that you can really experiment with as you become more confident applying makeup. Factors like color, texture, and line application can have a big impact on the appearance of your peepers. Play around!",

            "Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks. Smile as you do this so you can clearly see where the apples are. Dab on the blush and blend upwards towards your temples.\n\n\nTry a cream blush for a natural glow that's easy to blend in.[9]\n\nIf you opt for powder blush, use a brush that's fluffy yet dense. Dust translucent powder over it to blend the edges.[10]",
            "Apply lipstick or lip gloss. Pucker your lips like you're about to plant a kiss and dab the lip color to the center of your upper and lower lip. This first application can be straight from the tube; then, use your fingers to blend outwards, adding color with your fingertips as needed.\n\n\nIf your lips are chapped, prep them before putting on lip color. Gently buff them with a warm, damp washcloth and put on a light layer of lip balm. Let the balm absorb before moving on to lipstick or gloss.[11]\n\nFor beginners, the lips are a great opportunity to add color and vary your makeup regime without having to fuss over application technique, etc. You can work with anything from neutral, barely-there gloss to creamy, fire-engine red.",

The goal is to get all the areas that you’ll later put makeup on covered up and protected.[12]",

Skip the bottom lashes unless you’re going for a Twiggy-esque look.[14]\n\nCurling your lashes is optional, and eyeliner isn’t a must for a casual, daily look.

Pick a hue that’s slightly deeper than your lip color, and concentrate the color in the middle of your lips, blending outwards. When in doubt, choose a soft, neutral color - a light pink or soft beige will give your lips a glowy “oomph” while still looking natural and casual.\n\n\nIf you’re in a rush, just dabbing on some Vaseline will do (and is especially great if you’ve got really sensitive lips!). Throw the lip balm in your bag so you’re always ready for touch-ups.",
            "Keep your base makeup simple. For a stunning, vibrant look, you’ll most likely want to highlight either your eyes or your lips to keep things balanced.

Put on some primer, foundation, a little concealer, and you’re ready to get the best part of this look started.[15]",
            "Play around with colorful eyeliner for a fun pop. Line either your top or bottom lids, close to your lashes, with an eye-catching color, like aquamarine, hot pink, or deep plum. Edgy? 100%. Classy? That too -- this look is subtle yet fun enough to make you stand out from the crowd.[16]\n\nYou might also try using shimmery gold shadow just on the inner corners of your eyes. It’ll brighten up your eyes and make you look like royalty.",
            "Color block your eyeshadow for a striking look. Who said eyeshadow has to match your eye color or be “barely there?” A fun, bold shadow will make you stand out like no other. All you have to do is pat some light colored blue shadow (or whichever color you prefer - your pick!) on your upper lid and smudge it onto your lower lash line, taking care to blend it well. Then, use a darker blue eyeshadow on the corner of your eyes and blend it in with a brush.[17]\n\nMatching blue mascara on both your top and bottom lashes will make your look even cooler!",
            "Try a wild lip color with an otherwise bare face. Now’s the time to pull out all the stops. Neon orange, metallic blue, carbon black, banana yellow, forest green…flash a smile wearing any of these shades and you’ll be the belle of the ball.[18]",
            "Go with ombre lips for a hypnotizing effect. It’s easier than it sounds! Try doing a light plum around the outer part of your lips and filling in the rest with a bright orange, or maybe you’re in the mood to line your lips with hot pink and fill the outline in with a poppy red. Regardless of the color combo, this is a look guaranteed to shift all eyes your way! The lipstick application doesn’t have to be perfect - just make sure to blend the edges between the colors so it looks intentional.[19]\n\nSomething else you can try is doing a two-toned look: make your upper lips a really bold color, like a bright red, and do a red one to two shades lighter on your bottom lip.[20]",
            "Go with neon lips and lids if you’re feeling extra bold. A “tame” approach to doing wild, out-there makeup is to highlight either just your eyes or your lips. But in makeup, the only rule is that there are no rules. So take that matte candy pink lipstick and the solid turquoise eyeshadow and go to town! This is a pairing that will work especially well for a night out on the town with friends.[21]",
            "Go for elegance with a cat-eye. Using a black liquid liner, trace the top of your upper lashes starting at the inner corner, making the line thicker as you move the liner outwards. Now comes the flick. Do a curvy wing if you want to make your eyes look bigger or if you have deep eyelid creases; try a triangular wing for added definition or if you have shallow creases. Experiment with how long you want the flick to be - it’s up to you![22]",
            "Try a sultry smokey eye. This is a makeup pinnacle, no doubt! But it’s nowhere near as hard to create as you might think. Pat a little bit of eyeshadow primer on your lids to make sure your shadow sticks. Then, apply a dark shadow (black, brown, gray - your choice) from your lashes to your crease, and then use a small brush to apply that same shadow along your lower lashline. From your crease to your brow bone, apply a slightly lighter shade of that dark color you first used. Take a Q-tip and smudge the shadow so it looks blended.[23]\n\nTake a creamy dark pencil and line your lashes to make sure no skin is showing - it should be all dark, dark, dark. If you can get inside the rim of your eyes, even better. Top it all off with a coat of mascara and you’re set to smolder!\nSome pearly highlighter along your brow bone and the inner corner of your eyes will make you look wide-eyed and dewy.\nKeep your lips neutral to bring all the attention to your eyes. A nude lipstick with a pink undertone (for cool skin tones) and a caramel undertone (for warm skin tones) will do the trick.[24]",
            "Do a classic red lip. Whether you’re going on a date with your crush or wanting to turn heads at the school dance, a red lip will impress. This quintessential French look is easy to achieve: use a soft toothbrush to remove dead skin from your lips, then put a thin coat of your favorite foundation over them. Now take an angled lipstick brush and apply the red using short strokes.\n\n\nIn a hurry? Just use the applicator the lipstick came in, but use your fingertips to blend it in as you go. Use a liner in a shade similar to that of your lipstick and trace the outline of your lips with it. Voila! You’re done.[25]\n\nLet your lips be the star by keeping your eye makeup minimal. A cat-eye flick or just one coat of mascara will do the trick.[26]",
            "Shine bright with strategic highlighting. For a glowy, luxe appearance, make use of shimmer. Apply subtly pearly highlighter right over your cheekbones all the way down the bridge of your nose. Don’t use too much, though, or you’ll risk looking shiny instead of dewy. Then, use a little bit of silver shadow on the inner corner of your eye, and put a little bit as well over the top of your upper lip to bring attention to all the right places.[27]",
            "Apply concealer to cover up blemishes. When applying makeup for a workday, less is more. A little bit of concealer over late-night undereye circles will cover up any visible discoloration. You can also put some on over any unexpected pimples or pesky blemishes and keep them a well-kept secret. Make sure to blend in the concealer with a small brush so it doesn’t look like you’re trying to cover up anything![28]",
            "Put on a bit of eyeliner for subtle definition. Eyeliner isn’t a must, but if you want to define your eyes come Monday morning, it can do wonders. Take a black or brown gel liner and tap it along your upper lash line, wiggling the brush just a touch every time it makes contact with your skin to ensure the pigment stays. Move from the inner corner of your eyes outwards. That’s all![29]",
            "Wear one coat of black mascara. For work, you want to stay away from anything too flashy, meaning no colored mascara or falsies. But a simple coat of lengthening mascara will make you look wide-eyed and awake, even when you feel anything but.[30]",
            "Put on a nude or pinkish lipstick or balm to finish up. Again, subtleness goes a long way at work. You want to look fresh-faced, so a lip balm that’s lightly tinted or a nude-pink lipstick can help tie your look together.[31]\n\nFor a slightly more vibrant, playful vibe, use your fingertips to dab on some coral or cherry-red lipstick, concentrating the color in the middle of your lips."

    "wikiHow to Calculate a Down Payment for a Car": {
        "intro": "Buying a car can be daunting, with the moving parts of finding a car you like, securing financing, and getting rid of your old vehicle if you have one. Knowing how much a down payment for a car you are interested in is a key element of decision making when you are on the market for a new automobile.",
        "steps": [
            "Consider your options. Dealerships make money by offering higher interest loans than other financial institutions.[1] Because of that, you should know ahead of time how much you are willing to spend, and stick to that. Generally, if you have a credit score above 650, you should be able to get financing through a bank or credit union for a much better interest rate than at a dealership.",
            "Decide how much you can afford to pay as a down payment. Most analysts recommend putting at least 20% down on your car, although the average down payment in recent years has been only 12%[2]. The danger of putting less than 20% down is that your car may lose resale value faster than you pay off your loan, leaving you “upside down” or unable to pay off your loan by selling the car.\n\n\nUnless you have practice investing, it is generally smarter to pay for as much of your car as possible up front rather than investing in savings and using the earnings to make monthly car payments. The interest cost on the car loan is generally higher than you can expect to earn on a short-term investments. However, the new zero interest loans might make sense if the price of the car is as low as it would be paying cash.\nIf you do decide to pay less of a down payment than you can afford, paying at least 20% of the car's cost as a down payment will increase the chances that your car retains its value above the amount outstanding in your loan.\nKeep in mind that your initial payment may include a downpayment on the purchase price as well as various fees from the dealer or licensing authority.",
            "Calculate your monthly payment budget. How much can you afford to spend on your car payment each month? And for how long?\n\n\nConsider the type of car you will be buying and how long you will drive it as well, when thinking about the life of your loan.",
            "Shop beforehand. Use online resources to look at the cars for sale in your area. Use Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds to find the fair value of the car before going to the dealership. Make a list of a few cars at different dealerships you would be interested in.\n\n\nIf you want to trade in your current car, look at the fair value of it using one of the same tools. Most car value calculators include an option to calculate the trade-in value of the car.\nConsider buying a used car. New cars are the most expensive and lose their value a lot faster than used cars.[3] You can buy a one- to three-year-old car and save thousands off the price you would pay for a brand new one.",
            "Go to the dealer. Once you have an idea of what you want and what you can afford, go look at the cars you wrote down on your list. Test drive them, and if you like one, make an offer. Start by offering less than the fair value for the car based on your research. If the dealer rejects your offer, leave the lot. You can come back later if you want, but physically leaving will signal that you are serious about looking for a bargain.\n\n\nDon’t be persuaded to test drive a car you didn’t come to look at. Because they are paid on commission, dealers will want you to buy as expensive a car as possible, regardless of your financial position. Make clear that you came to see only a specific car or type of car, and that you won’t stray from that price range.\nDon’t tell the dealer about a car you are planning to trade in until after you have made a deal. This will ensure you get the best offer possible from the dealer before offering to trade in your car.",
            "Accept an offer. When you’ve found a car you like for a price that seems right, accept the offer. Then you can negotiate the type of financing you will get. You will have to apply for a loan through the dealership, so they will likely want to see your recent pay stubs as proof of income, as well as identification.",
            "Negotiate your auto loan. This is where your down payment comes in — the more you are able to pay in down payment, the less you have to borrow from the dealership. The dealer may try to convince you to borrow everything from them — that’s because they earn interest on the money you borrow. This is also when you should notify the dealer if you are interested in trading in a vehicle.\n\n\nThink about how long you realistically plan to drive this car as you determine the life of the loan. A dealer will try to entice you with very low monthly payments, but beware as this tactic will keep you making monthly payments for years to come.\nIf possible, try to get a loan for three years or less. A shorter term with a higher monthly payment will save you a lot of money in total rather than making low monthly payments for a very long time.",
            "Buy auto insurance. Dealers will be more open to financing a car with a salvaged title, but you will still need to get insurance on the vehicle you purchase. If you have pre-existing insurance, you can likely call your agent and add your new vehicle.",
            "Plan ahead. The first thing you should do when you decide to buy a car is decide how much you can afford to pay upfront, and how much of a monthly payment you can afford. You should also consider the costs of borrowing to buy a car, as you will pay interest on your auto loan. Decide how long you are willing to make payments and whether the cost of borrowing is worth it.\n\n\nUse online tools like Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds to research different cars and price ranges. This way you can get an idea of what you want without having a salesperson pressuring you.\nDecide whether you are willing to purchase a used car. Used cars generally offer a lot more value than new ones, as new cars lose about 10% of their resale value as soon as they leave the lot, and about 20% of their resale value within the first year.[4]",
            "Go to the bank. Before you start shopping for your car, you should go to the bank and get pre-approved for an auto loan. Banks generally offer much lower interest rates on auto loans than dealerships do.[5] Take a copy of your two most recent paychecks, which the bank will want to review as proof of income. Ask about getting an auto loan. The bank will take your information and tell you what amount, if any, you are approved to borrow. At this point, you still need to go shop for a car, so you won’t enter the loan until you choose one and allow the bank to inspect it.\n\n\nCredit unions also offer auto loans at competitive rates. You should start with whatever institution you already have accounts with, as these are the most likely to offer you a good interest rate.[6]\n\nRemember that the amount you are approved for is the maximum you can borrow, so you shouldn’t automatically take the whole thing! Instead, ask the bank to give you payment quotes on different amounts and time periods, and think back to the budgeting you did before.\nYou may also ask about the cost of an unsecured loan from the bank. On a normal auto loan, the bank holds the title to the car, and you make payments to them until the balance is completely paid. Then the title is passed to you. An unsecured loan means that the bank loans you money without securing collateral. If you are only borrowing a few thousand dollars, the interest rate on the unsecured loan may not be much higher, and you will hold the car title outright.",
            "Consider insurance. If you are borrowing money for a car from your bank, you need to plan to get comprehensive insurance to protect your car from damage while the bank owns the title. (If you take out an unsecured loan this won’t apply.) Make sure you count the cost of insurance in your calculation.\n\n\nMost banks won’t finance the purchase of a car that has a salvaged title. Salvaged means the car has been totaled in the past, so that the damage to the car would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself. Insurance companies won’t insure salvaged vehicles with comprehensive insurance, which most banks require to secure an auto loan.\nIf you already have a car under an insurance policy, you can call your insurance company and ask what the cost of adding specific vehicles would be.",
            "Make a budget. Once you know what amount you are approved for, you can add whatever money you are able to pay as a down payment, and the total is how much you can spend on a car. You should consider spending less, just because the more you borrow from the bank, the more interest you will pay.\n\n\nFor example, say you are approved at the bank for an auto loan up to $10,000, and you have $5,000 in cash to put towards a car. You could combine the two and buy a car worth $15,000, or you could use less than the bank offered and buy a $12,000 car, with $5,000 of your own money and $7,000 in borrowed funds from the bank.",
            "Shop for a car. Using the price range you’ve established, start shopping! You can shop for a car either at a dealership or from individual owners selling their own cars, and modern tools like Craigslist and Cars.com will allow you to search vehicles for sale in your area without leaving home. Make a list of three or four cars you’re interested in, and go look at each before making a decision.\n\n\nGenerally, you will pay more for a vehicle at a dealership than from a private party. Many dealerships will let you trade in your old car for credit against the new one, but they might be less likely to negotiate the price of the car.[7] You may be better off selling the car separately, either privately or to CarMax.\nIf you go to a dealership, stick to your budget. Dealers usually are paid by commission, so they want you to buy the most expensive car on the lot. By knowing ahead of time how much you are willing to spend and what you’re interested in, you can avoid some of this nonsense and start by test driving the car you researched.",
            "Negotiate. Especially at dealerships, prices are always negotiable. Use the fact that you know your budget and have other options to your advantage and negotiate the price you pay for the car. Remember what amount of money you were approved for at the bank, and only accept an offer that is reasonable and within your budget.\n\n\nYou know the fair value of the car based on your research, so offer slightly less than that for the car. If the dealer rejects your offer, leave and go look at the next car on your list. The dealer will likely make you a counteroffer that you can come back to, but by walking off the lot you show that you’re serious about finding a bargain. Often as you are leaving the dealer will offer to sell at your suggested price.\nIf you’re getting rid of your old car, a dealership might also offer you the trade in value of your car. Generally this is less than what you can get by selling the car yourself, but some people prefer to trade in vehicles simply because of the convenience. If you do trade in your car, don’t tell the dealer about it until after you have negotiated a final price for the car, so that you get the most value for each individual vehicle.[8]\n\nHowever, you also don't want to lie, so you can mention you may want to trade-in, but tell the dealer, \"We can talk about that later. Right now let's focus on the cost of the new car.\"[9]",
            "Make your purchase. When a dealer or private party has accepted your offer, it’s time to go back to the bank. The bank will want to inspect the car, review the title, and look up the vehicle history. Once the inspection is complete the bank will complete your loan and take the title of the car.\n\n\nYou will either have to get insurance before the loan is closed, or right away afterwards. The bank will require you to list them as a part-owner in the automobile, so if you are in an accident that damages the car, they maintain collateral."

Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can follow to help your leopard gecko shed and keep its skin clean.",
        "steps": [
            "Check to see if your gecko is dirty. Leopard geckos rarely need to be bathed. In fact, over-bathing your gecko can dry out its skin and cause disease. You should only bathe your gecko if it is having difficulties shedding or a veterinarian instructs you to wash it.\n\n\nYou can also wash your gecko if it is noticeably dirty. However, you should avoid doing to more than once a month.\nThis method for washing your leopard gecko can be used to clean other large lizards.",
            "Wash your hands. Before you take your gecko out of it vivarium, you need to wash your hands with hot water and soap. This will help prevent you from transferring microorganisms to your gecko that could potentially make it ill or kill it. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the soap off of your hands as well. Soap can make your gecko very ill.[1]\n\nYou should also wash your hands after handling the gecko to prevent spreading any diseases from it to others.",
            "Fill a small container with warm water. Once you have determined that your gecko needs a bath, fill a small container with warm water up to the bottom of its belly, generally less than a half-inch (13mm). Because geckos are cold-blooded and unable to regulate their body temperature, make sure that the water is between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 32 degrees Celsius).[2]\n\nAvoid using any soaps. This may make your gecko extremely ill. Just use warm water unless instructed otherwise.\nIf your leopard gecko is having difficulty shedding, let it soak for a few minutes and gently pour water over its back. This will help moisten and soften the dead skin. Be sure to avoid getting water in the gecko’s eyes, which can easily dry out.\nYour veterinarian might also suggest adding a drop of mineral oil to the water. This will help soften the shedding skin and make it come off easier.[3]\n\nIf your leopard gecko has a fungal infection on its skin, your veterinarian make recommend that you add a little Betadine solution to the water.",
            "Scrub the gecko. After the gecko is comfortably in the warm water, dampen a washcloth, paper towel or a Q-tip and gently massage its skin. This will clean your gecko and remove any dead skin. Do not pull on any shedding skin. This could hurt your gecko, leading to skin damage and possibly an infection.[4]\n\nDo not scrub too hard and rip the skin off your gecko. In places, the shedding skin will still be attached to the new skin underneath it. There will likely still be pieces of dead skin attached to your gecko when you finish.\nYou can also rub your gecko with your fingertips. However, be sure to resist the temptation to pluck any flakes of dead skin.\nIf you brush gently, a toothbrush may also help remove dead skin.",
            "Dry your gecko. After you have properly bathed your leopard gecko, you should dry it with a cloth or paper towel. Gently wrap the gecko in the cloth, keeping its head exposed. Softly rub the animal’s body in slow circular motions with your cloth, and then gently wipe the top of its head and its vent area.[5]\n\nThrow away any paper towels immediately, and be sure to wash and disinfect any washcloths you use.\nBe sure to dry your gecko quickly to keep it from getting too cold.",
            "Check for excess skin build up. Over time, you may notice that your leopard gecko does not shed completely and that excess skin can collect in certain places. This can be problematic around your gecko’s tail and toes, where blood flow can become constricted. If the problem goes untreated, your gecko might lose its toes or its tail due to a lack of oxygen. Fortunately, its tail will grow back. However, the toes will be gone forever. If you notice a buildup, you may want to moisten your gecko’s skin to help the excess fall off.[6]\n\nIn nature, geckos regularly lose their toes because of constricted blood flow due to skin buildup. Although this is disconcerting, your gecko should be fine. If it does lose a toe, keep an eye on the wound to make sure that it does not become infected.[7]",
            "Get a moist box. In order to help your leopard gecko properly shed, provide it with a moist house or box. This is a special enclosure that you add to the gecko’s vivarium and keep moist. You can buy these boxes at your local pet store. You can also make one yourself using by cutting a hole in the side of an old plastic container and placing moist paper towels in the bottom. While your gecko is shedding you will need to moisten this box every day.[8]\n\nIf you keep your gecko properly moistened, you should avoid any difficulties when it comes to shedding.",
            "Give the gecko a massage. Moisten your fingertips or a Q-tip with a little lukewarm water and gently massage any areas where the skin has built up. Again, be gentle and do not rub so hard that the skin tears off. It should wad up and roll off in a clump.[9]",
            "Make a gecko sauna. Add warm paper towels to your gecko’s moist box or another container. The temperature should not be more that 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). Then place the gecko in the box and let it sit there for about thirty minutes. Once the time is up, take the gecko out and gently massage the areas of built up skin.[10]\n\nIf you use a container that is not your moist box, make sure that you add holes so that your gecko can breathe.",
            "Be patient. If you are unable to get the excess skin to come off, do not force it. Scrubbing too hard or washing too often can hurt your gecko. If you give the gecko a moist place to hang out, the skin should come off. If it does not, try again after a few days or go see a veterinarian.[11]",
            "Place a bathing dish in the gecko’s habitat. Leopard geckos get most of their moisture from the crickets that they eat. However, they do benefit from a small bathing dish in their bowl. Simply take a small plastic bowl and fill it with water about a half-inch (13mm) deep. This will help with the habitats humidity and give the gecko a place to cool off it gets too hot.[12]\n\nMaintaining the right humidity is essential to keeping your gecko’s skin healthy.\nBe sure to replace the water every day.",

Removing the dirty sand and replacing it with fresh sand will help prevent your gecko from developing any skin issues.

However, newspaper needs regular replacement, while artificial turf is difficult to clean.",
            "Remove any waste. Once a gecko moves into a new enclosure, it will designate one area in the habitat as its bathroom. Although this makes cleaning up after your gecko easy, you should be diligent about cleaning its waste. Determine where your gecko’s bathroom is and clean it daily.[14]\n\nUse a small fishing net to scoop the waste out of the habitat.",
            "Clean the vivarium. Occasionally, you will need to fully clean out the entire vivarium. This includes scrubbing and cleaning the glass, as well as washing any bowls or containers. The best time to do this is when you replace the sand in your animal’s vivarium. However, if you feel like your vivarium is not dirty enough to be cleaned every six months, you can wait and do it once a year.[15]\n\nRegular washings of your animal’s habitat will ensure that it stays clean and healthy."

If not, go back and repeat the steps to make sure the coil of line coming off the spool of line is coiling onto the reel spool in the same direction.\n\n\nA good way to spool the line is to take a soft cotton cloth and hold the line in the cloth at about the first eye. Apply a good amount of tension, so the line does not spool loose, and you can real as fast as you like."

Learning how to do breathing exercises is a great place to start and then you can progress to other quick and easy meditation strategies. You may also benefit from progressive muscle relaxation, which is not the same as meditation, but it can produce a relaxed, meditative state. Learning how to do a quick and easy meditation can help restore calm to your mind and get you back on track to tackle the rest of your day.",

If you can't find a quiet place inside, try sitting outside.",

You can sit on the floor or in a chair, so long as you can keep a straight posture.[3]\n\nSit up straight, keeping your back and neck aligned.\nClose your eyes. This can help block out distractions and promote a state of relaxation.\nYou may want to put one hand on your belly. This can help you feel your breathing, which can help you recognize whether or not you're breathing deeply.",
            "Take deep breaths into your abdomen. Deep breathing is as simple as taking slow, deep, long inhalations and slow, extended exhalations. You can do it for as long or as short as you need to. Any time your mind wanders back to something stressful, simply focus on your breath.[4]\n\nInhale slowly through your nostrils.\nFeel your breath travel down into your abdomen to your diaphragm (just below the ribs).\nFocus on the sensations of breathing deeply, in and out.\nYou should be able to feel your belly rise and fall on each breath with your hand. If you don't feel your breath, you may need to take slower, deeper breaths.",
            "Find a quiet space. You can meditate anywhere, but it's best to find a quiet place free of distractions. If you're at work and you have an office, try closing the door. If you don't have your own space, you can go for a walk on your lunch break and find a peaceful place away from the office.[5]\n\nIf possible, reduce distractions by silencing your cellphone and turning off your computer.\nTry and find someplace you can be alone for 5 to 10 minutes. If you can't find a quiet space indoors, you might want to try sitting outside (if the weather permits it).",

There's no prescribed position; it's just crucial that you get into a position that helps you relax.[6]\n\nWhen some people think of seated meditation, they picture a meditation master sitting in perfect lotus position with the legs crossed. If this is comfortable for you, then go ahead, but if not just find what makes you relaxed.\nYou can try sitting with your legs crossed, sitting in a regular chair or on a bench, or even lying flat on the floor.\nIf you're comfortable (and feel safe) closing your eyes, then go ahead. If not, keep your eyes open but try to focus on a point on the ground just in front of you.",

Notice the sensation of your belly rising and falling with each inhalation and exhalation.\nYou can either set a timer for 5 to 10 minutes, or simply breathe until you feel a sense of calm come over you.\nYou can take these little meditation breaks anytime and any place when you need to calm down and quiet an anxious mind.",

Choose a place that is totally relaxing. It doesn't matter if you've never been there, just imagine a place of peace and tranquility.\nImagine the sounds you'd hear there. For example, if your visual image was a quiet beach, you might imagine the sound of waves slowly lapping or surging against the shore.\nNext, imagine the physical sensations you might experience there. If you're on a beach, you might imagine the sun warming your skin and the gritty feeling of sand underneath you.\nTry to incorporate an olfactory sense, if you can. On the beach, for example, you might smell the ocean's salty water wafting in on the breeze, or perhaps the smell of sun screen on your body.",
            "Open your eyes and stand up slowly. You can continue visualizing for as long as you'd like. When you're ready, simply open your eyes (slowly) and get ready to stand up.

After closing your eyes and imagining a quiet, peaceful place, it may be jarring to remember your actual immediate surroundings.\nDon't try to stand up too quickly or you might get disoriented.\nYou may want to stretch out your muscles before you stand up to get the blood flowing again.\nFix any clothing you might have loosened, and you should be calm and ready to tackle the rest of your day.",

    "wikiHow to Fix Nicotine Stained Fingers": {
        "intro": "Smoking causes a wide range of negative health effects, but it also has some obvious physical effects, such as yellow nicotine stains on your nails and fingers. Yellow stains on your fingers and fingernails may seem like they are permanent, but there are some remedies to remove, or at least lessen the discoloration caused by smoking.[1]",
        "steps": [
            "Exfoliate your skin. Dampen your skin by soaking your fingers in water for a few minutes, but not long enough for the skin to prune. Use a nail file, pumice stone, body brush, salt scrub, or sugar scrub to sand away some of the nicotine stains on your fingers.[2] Use gentle pressure to rub the grit onto the yellowed area of your fingers just until the stain looks faded.[3]\n\nDo not rub your finger for more than a few seconds since it can cause irritation.\nThe sandpaper from a matchbox will also work.\nStop rubbing the area if it becomes red or irritated",
            "Apply a bleach solution. A dilute solution of bleach and water may also help to get rid of yellow nicotine stains on your fingers. Mix 1 part bleach with 4 parts water for this solution into a glass container. Then, dip a nail brush into the solution and apply it to the yellowed area of your fingers. Leave it on your fingers for a few minutes and then rinse it off.[4]\n\nIf this isn’t enough to get rid of the stains, then you can also soak your fingers in the solution for five minute intervals five times a day.\nAfter you rinse your hands, apply some hand cream or moisturizer to counter the drying effects of the bleach.\nYou may want to wear a mask when doing this method.\nDon’t attempt this method when you have an open wound or right after using a different stain removal method.\nDo not use this method if you are sensitive to bleach. If you use this method and it irritates your skin, then rinse the bleach off of your skin right away.",
            "Scrub your fingers with toothpaste. Toothpaste can also help to remove nicotine stains from your fingers. Take any standard brand of toothpaste and squeeze a dab of it onto the yellow area of one of your fingers. Then, use a toothbrush to scrub the toothpaste into the yellow skin for a few minutes and rinse the area with warm water when you are done.[5]\n\nTry using a whitening toothpaste for extra tough nicotine stains.",
            "Apply lemon juice. Lemon juice is an effective natural bleaching agent that may help to remove stains from your fingers. Use a knife to cut a fresh lemon in half, then take half of the lemon and hold it against the yellow area of your fingers. Rub the stained areas with the lemon half until it’s coated in lemon juice.[6]\n\nLeave the lemon coating on your fingers for 5-10 minutes and then rinse it away with warm water.\nYou can repeat this process up to five times per day.\nKeep in mind that this method will sting if you have any small cuts on your fingertips.",
            "Rub your fingertips with a potato. This method is gentler than some of the other methods so it may be a good option if you have sensitive skin. Peel a potato and then use it to rub the stained area of your fingers for a few minutes. Rinse away the potato juice after a few minutes have passed.[7]\n\nYou can repeat this process up to 10 times per day.",
            "Dissolve an aspirin in water. Take a single aspirin tablet and dissolve it in a standard 8 oz. cup of hot water. Dip the stained fingers into the water after it has cooled down a bit. Soak your fingers in the water for several minutes. Wash your hands with soap and water when you have finished soaking your fingertips.[8]\n\nYou can also add a few drops of water to a single aspirin tablet to form a paste and use the paste to scrub your nails. Use a nail brush to apply the paste to the yellow areas of your skin and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then, rinse away the paste and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.",
            "Dip your nails into hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has some whitening properties that can remove nicotine stains from your fingernails. Pour 3-4 tablespoons (15 ml per tablespoon) of 3% hydrogen peroxide into half a cup (118.5 ml) of water and stir well. Then, dip your nails into the solution and soak them for about 15 minutes. Use a toothbrush to scrub any remaining stains off of your nails and then rinse off your nails with water.[9]\n\nYou can use hydrogen peroxide to clean your nails once per week for up to three months.\nKeep in mind that this method will sting if you have any small cuts on your fingers.",
            "Apply apple cider vinegar. Vinegar derived from apple cider contains acetic and malic acids that can decrease discoloration in nails. Pour half a cup (118.5 ml) of lukewarm water into a dish with half a cup of apple cider vinegar. Soak your affected nails in the solution for about twenty minutes. Then, rinse off your nails and use a towel to dry them off.[10]\n\nYou can repeat this process three times a day for up to a month.\nSoaking your nails in apple cider vinegar will sting if you have an open wound.",
            "Soak your nails in mouthwash. An alcohol-based mouthwash can also help to get rid of stains on your fingernails. Pour some mouthwash into a clean plastic cup. Make sure that there is enough for you to dip your fingers into the mouthwash. Soak your nails in the mouthwash for 30 minutes.[11]\n\nYou can repeat this process once a day for one week.\nThis method works best with Listerine or a similar alcohol-based mouthwash.",
            "Rub your nails with orange peels. Orange peels are also high in vitamin C and they can help to get rid of yellow stains on your nails as well. Peel an orange and rub the inner portion of the peels along your yellow nails for 5 to 10 minutes per session.\n\n\nDo this two to three times daily for several weeks.\nYou can also add two tablespoons (30 ml) of dried orange peel powder to water to create a paste. Use a nail brush to layer the paste on your affected nails. Let the paste sit for 10 minutes, and then rinse off with tepid water. Do the paste method twice a day for a couple of weeks.[12]",
            "Wear gloves when you smoke. If the smoke does not make contact with your fingertips, then it will not be able to stain your skin. Try wearing gloves when you smoke to prevent the smoke from reaching your fingertips.\n\n\nSome plain knit winter gloves will help to reduce the smoke exposure, but some may still seep through. Try wearing some vinyl or leather gloves to protect your fingers even more.",
            "Apply a thick lotion to your hands and fingertips before smoking. Applying a layer of lotion may also help to create a barrier between your fingers and the smoke. Smooth on a thick layer of hand lotion or petroleum jelly before you light up a cigarette.\n\n\nApplying lotion after you smoke is not a bad idea either. The lotion can help to reduce the smell of the cigarette smoke as well.",
            "Wash your hands right after you smoke. Good hygiene is important when you are a smoker. The smell of cigarettes can linger on your hands for a long time if you do not wash your hands and that also gives the nicotine a chance to stain your fingers.\n\n\nTry to get into the habit of washing your hands with soap and warm water right after you finish smoking.",
            "Quit smoking. As long as you smoke you will have a high risk of exposing your fingers and fingernails to more nicotine stains. You could enter community support groups to help you quit smoking. You can also ask your doctor about non-staining replacements like the nicotine patch, e-cigarettes, or ask your doctor about other quitting aids that will not stain.[13]\n\nYou may want to avoid chewing tobacco or anything else that may stain another part of your body instead—like your teeth.",
            "Smoke with an intervening device. You can smoke with a metal device in between the smoking element and your hand or mouth like a hookah or metal pipe. This will not benefit your overall health, but it will reduce the amount of nicotine that reaches your fingers.[14]\n\nIn the hookah method, you hold the metal holster mid-way while breathing in from one end while the back end is hooked up to a larger container of tobacco that is being heated.\nOther metal pipes simply have you place the cigarette at one end of the pipe while you hold the metal tube and inhale from the free end.\nThe smoke by volume is much greater with a hookah than a typical cigarette. The smoke is cooled as it passes through a water system before going through the pipe the user inhales from."

    "wikiHow to Disarm Someone With a Knife": {
        "intro": "Hopefully, you will never have to face someone with a knife. Barehanded fighting against a knife is very dangerous (the risk of injury is about 80%), so you should always try to flee from an attacker if possible.[1] If you must face a knife-wielding attacker, however, knowing how to defend yourself and take the knife away can save your life.",
        "steps": [
            "Create distance between yourself and the attacker, if possible.[2] If it turns out that you must face a knife-wielding attacker one-on-one, start by backing away. Try to put as much distance as possible between yourself and the attacker. Experts recommend seven yards as a distance that will keep you safe from a knife attack.[3]",
            "Use an object as a shield.[4] If you want to disarm an opponent or attacker, you will have to do so at the right moment. While you are waiting, you can protect yourself by using an object as a shield. Try to find a hard, rigid object such as a board or trash can lid, but any object (even a coat, blanket, etc.) can help. Hold the object in front of you to protect yourself against sudden attacks.\n\n\nA shield will help keep your vulnerable areas protected. Remember that your most vulnerable areas are at your core (chest, abdomen), so keep those protected above all.[5]",
            "Keep your body perpendicular to the attacker.[6] Try not to stand directly in front of the attacker; this makes you more vulnerable to attacks. Instead, remain to the side of the attacker if at all possible. That way, you will have a chance to see if the attacker turns to lunge toward you, and have slightly more time to react.",
            "Block and redirect attacks.[7] If the attacker lunges at you before you are able to get the knife, step to the side out of his/her way. The attacker may then turn around to face you again. Be prepared and move to the side of the attacker, so that you can avoid direct stabs in your direction.",
            "Deflect the attacker’s arm if he or she strikes.[8] If the attacker lunges at you and you are not able to get out of the way, grab the attacker’s arm as he/she moves toward you. Use both of your hands to grab on, if possible. Yank the attacker’s arm and use the attacker’s momentum to throw him/her to the ground, making sure to keep the knife pointed away from you.",
            "Stop an underhand knife attack. If the attacker lunges at you using an upward motion, use the blade of your hand to chop into the attacker's hand. Do this forcefully, and it will push the attacker’s arm backward. Use your hands to push and hold the attacker's arm back so that the knife stays away from you. Slam the attacker’s arm into a hard surface or apply pressure until the knife falls from his/her hand.",
            "Throw the attacker from the ground. If the attacker lunges toward you with the knife, back away and pretend to fall down so that you are still facing the attacker. Prop yourself up on your forearms, keep your left foot raised, and wait for the attacker to approach. When the attacker is within reach of your feet, put your left foot against his/her heel. Slam your right leg against the back of the attacker's knee as hard as you can, pushing the attacker away. If you do this correctly, your attacker will fall face first, with the knife aimed away from you.",
            "Focus on controlling the weapon.[9] Do not try to attack the attacker. Remember that your primary goal is to keep yourself safe. If you are not able to get away from the attacker, then this means eliminating the source of danger: the knife.",
            "Get ahold of the attacker’s limb with both hands.[10][11] When you are ready to remove the knife from the attacker’s hand, grab his/her arm as quickly as you can. Use both of your hands if possible. Try to stabilize the attacker’s arm (hold it in place). This will be difficult since the attacker will probably try to get out of your grip, so you must hold on as firmly as you can.",
            "Injure the attacker’s hand.[12] Slam the attacker’s hand against a hard surface as quickly as you can. You can even try to break the attacker’s wrist or hand if necessary.[13] If you cannot slam the attacker’s hand against anything, focus on applying as much pressure as you can to his/her arm until it is injured. If this goes well, the attacker's on the knife will loosen, and the weapon will fall away.",
            "Keep the knife away. Once the attacker is disarmed, make sure that the knife is far out of his/her reach. Kick, push, or fling the knife as far as you can so that the attacker cannot reach it.\n\n\nOnce the attacker is disarmed, try to flee to safety.",
            "Use a weapon if necessary and possible.[14][15] If the attacker still attempts to harm you after you disarm him/her, and you cannot get away, try to use a non-deadly weapon (not the knife) to defend yourself. You could:\n\n\nThrow sand, rocks, or other small objects at the attacker. Hot coffee or ice water can even do the trick.\nHit the attacker with whatever object is at hand: a stick, chair, book, etc. You can even use a coat like a whip to strike the attacker.",
            "Incapacitate the attacker.[16] If you do not have any object at hand to help you, try and injure or immobilize the attacker using your own body. For instance:\n\n\nHeadbutt the attacker in his/her abdomen.\nStrike the attacker in the face, especially the eye, nose, or temple.\nKick the attacker in the knees or groin.",
            "Run, hide, fight.[17][18][19] When faced with an attacker, remember RHF: run, hide, fight. Your first tactic should be to run away, if you can get away without harming yourself. If you cannot escape the area, try to hide in a secure location, such as a room that can be locked, or behind a cover of some kind. You should fight back against the attacker only as a last resort.",
            "Stay as calm as possible. If you are faced with an attacker wielding a knife, you must work very hard to stay calm. This will be very difficult, because it is an extremely stressful situation. Not panicking, however, can save your life. It will help if you have the steps of a basic plan in mind:[20]\n\nStay calm\nQuietly signal for help, if possible\nMaintain eye contact\nStall for time\nKeep talking to the attacker\nFollow any instructions the attacker gives\nDo not risk harm to yourself or others if at all possible\nDo not try to grab the knife itself",
            "Move away. If becomes necessary to fight back and try to disarm the attacker (such as in the event that the attacker is attempting to stab you), then do so. However, if it is at all possible at any point during the confrontation, move away from the attacker.[21]\n\nYou can begin by trying to back away from the attacker. When you are several yards away, you can attempt to flee.\nIf the attacker becomes distracted or moves away from you, use the opportunity to run away as fast as you can until you are in a safe location.\nDo not run in a straight line; instead, move in a zig-zag or more erratic motion. This will confuse the attacker, helping you to escape.[22]",
            "Call 911 as soon as possible.[23][24] As soon as it is safe to do so (the attacker leaves, or you are able to get away), call 911 or another emergency number for assistance. Provide as detailed a description of the attacker as you can, and explain what is happening/what happened."

            "Be respectful. It's important to set an example for your siblings by always being respectful. Be respectful to them, of course, but you should also be respectful to your parents, your teachers, your friends, and even perfect strangers! Being respectful will help them a lot in life and if they learn it from someone they really respect, it will become a lifelong habit.\n\n\nDon't talk back to your parents or teachers. Politely argue if problems come up but otherwise do what you're told and show your sibling how it's done.",
            "Be responsible. It's also very important for your sibling to learn how to be responsible. Don't do drugs or alcohol and do keep up with your chores and help around the house. Do good in school but be humble about your grades. Get a job if your schedule allows and save your money responsibly. This helps you but it also sets a great example for them. They'll see that hard work and sacrifice pay off.",
            "Use good language. Definitely don't teach them every bad word in the book, but using good language also means speaking well. Speak correctly and with the best grammar and vocabulary you can manage. They'll pick up on your language and learn a lot. Good speech is often a sign of a better education and many employers consider it essential, so you'll be setting them up for a lifetime of success.",
            "Avoid violence. You should try not to be violent towards your siblings and set an extra good example by not being violent towards anyone else either. Kids who learn that being violent is cool from their siblings may go on to violent lifestyles that land them in prison or worse. Instead, solve your problem peaceably and by talking it out. If someone tries to goad you into a fight, be the bigger person and walk away.\n\n\nBoys who witness their parents being violent are twice as likely to be violent themselves,[1] so what do you think they'll do if they see a brother that they really look up to being violent?",
            "Be yourself. Teach your siblings to respect themselves by always being themselves. Do this by being yourself. Pursue the things that you love and don't let popular opinion sway you. Be individual and forget the trends and doing what will make you the most popular. By doing these things, your sibling will learn to be confident in their own skin.",
            "Protect others. Show your siblings that they should always stick up for the little guy and protect people who deserve protection by doing the same yourself. You never know, that little kid getting beat up at school may not have a brother that's able to protect him. Protecting the helpless will teach your siblings how to be good people and will make them respect you even more.",
            "Do what's right. Do the right thing, especially when it's hard. This also means apologizing or admitting when you're done something wrong. You want your siblings to be able to do the same, to always do the right thing. This will make both of you better people.",
            "Spend time with your siblings. The best way to start having a better relationship with your siblings is to spend time with them. Hang out, play, go places... it doesn't matter. Do whatever feels right for you. This will give you great memories together and also build a friendship beyond the sibling relationship.",

This will also make you happy because not only will they be proud of themselves but you'll be proud of them too.",
            "Build and keep their trust. If you want to have a good relationship with your siblings, you should have a lot of trust between you. When they tell you something, don't go and tell your parents. Keep things just between the two of you, unless your sibling asks you to tell your parents. If you can't trust each other, you'll probably have a hard relationship for the rest of your lives.\n\n\nYou should also build their trust by creating a safe place for them to come and talk about their problems. You should never laugh at them or judge them for the things they say to you, so that they know they can always come to you without fear of how you'll react.",

Try to do some of their unique hobbies with them or at least talk with and ask them about it from time to time.",
            "See things from their perspective. You will probably disagree about stuff sometimes. That's just how being siblings goes. But when you argue or when they do something you disagree with, try to see things from their point of view. Sympathize with them and understand that they're probably trying their best. This will help cut down on fights.\n\n\nSeeing things from their perspective can also be done every day. Appreciating their struggles in life and respecting them for what they go through will give you both a better respect for the other.",

    "wikiHow to Remove Facial Wrinkles with Fruit": {
        "intro": "Wrinkles begin to appear as you age because the skin becomes thinner and loses its elasticity.[1] While some people treat the signs of aging with more extreme measures like surgery or injections, you can also combat wrinkles using fruit. Fruit, in all its varieties, include a number of very powerful properties that can help reduce the appearance of face wrinkles from the inside and as a topical treatment.",
        "steps": [
            "Harness the power of antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that protect the body from damage done by harmful molecules called free radicals. An antioxidant-rich diet can help counteract the damaging effects that free radicals have on your skin, which helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Antioxidants and other important skin nutrients are found in a variety of sources, but the best source is fruit![2]",
            "Consume foods that are rich in vitamin C and vitamin E. Vitamins C and E are rich in skin-enhancing antioxidants, and some experts believe that vitamin C is the most important vitamin for combatting wrinkles.[3] Vitamin C supports collagen production, which keeps the skin plump and full of moisture, and vitamin E helps protect against radiation from the sun. Some fruits that are rich in vitamins C and E include:\n\n\nTomatoes are packed with vitamin C, which helps make skin look firmer and plumper. They also contain lycopene, which helps neutralize skin-damaging free radicals from the sun and improves vascular function. One study noted that regularly eating tomatoes for six weeks resulted in extra circulation, a noticeable glow, and increased protection against sunburn (which causes wrinkles!) by 33%.[4]\n\nAvocados are packed with both vitamins E and C, and they also contain B-complex vitamins and essential fatty acids that nourish the skin and keep it soft and wrinkle free. They are also high in glutathione, which flushes toxins from the body and is shown to help with acne and wrinkles.[5]\n\nCitrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, clementines, and tangerines, are very high in vitamin C. For example, a medium-sized orange provides about 117% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C![6]",
            "Eat foods that are high in vitamin A and beta-carotene. Vitamin A and beta-carotene, an antioxidant that converts into vitamin A within the body, are important nutrients for maintaining, protecting, and repairing the skin.[7] The antioxidants found in vitamin A- and beta-carotene-rich foods help to fortify the skin against getting wrinkles in the first place, as well as the formation of new wrinkles. Some fruits that are rich in vitamin A and beta-carotene include:\n\n\nCantaloupes are high in vitamin A and vitamin C, and they contain the most beta-carotene than any other fruit. Regularly eating a quarter of a medium-sized cantaloupe provides enough of these nutrients to promote skin cell turnover and increase skin elasticity.[8]\n\nStone fruits, especially apricots, are very high in beta-carotene antioxidants and other compounds that help fight wrinkles.[9]",
            "Munch on foods that contain quercetin. Quercetin is a type of flavonoid, which are natural compounds found in plants that contain antioxidant properties.[10] These antioxidants, like the antioxidants found in vitamins, help fight free radicals and their damaging effects on the skin. Some fruits that are rich sources of quercetin include:\n\n\nApples are one of the best sources of the quercetin. Apples also contain a great deal of vitamin C and are extremely hydrating, which are both great for the skin. Just be sure to eat the apple skins, since that’s where the quercetin is the most concentrated![11]\n\nRed grapes are also very high in quercetin, and like the apple, the antioxidant is most concentrated in the skin of this fruit. The antioxidants in red grapes will also help reduce inflammation of the skin and improve overall skin tone.[12]\n\nBerries, especially blueberries and raspberries, include a great deal of the wrinkle-fighting quercetin. Considered “free-radical scavengers,” many berries include high concentrations of quercetin, vitamins, and anthocyanins, which neutralize the enzymes that destroy connective tissue (i.e., that cause wrinkles!).[13]",
            "Wash and prep a small papaya. First peel the papaya, then cut it in half and remove the seeds. The seeds of the papaya are very abrasive, and leaving them in the mask could cause you to scratch or damage your skin.[14]",
            "Cut the papaya into small pieces and blend. Papayas contain enzymes that firm the skin and eat away the top layer of skin, which will help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles over time.[15] Be sure to add the whole papaya to the blender for maximum enzymes!",
            "Add 1 tablespoon of whole milk to the blender and blend until smooth. The milk will help make the texture of the face mask more manageable, but milk also contains alpha-hydroxy acids that encourage the production of collagen to fill in wrinkles.[16]",
            "Spread the papaya mixture on your face and neck. As you spread the mask on with your clean hands, gently massage the papaya and milk into areas with pronounced wrinkles. Relax and wait about 30 - 45 minutes for the mask to dry completely. When it is dry, rinse with lukewarm water, dry your face, and then apply moisturizer.",
            "Apply the mask three times a week. While it may take weeks, or even a few months, to see results, keep applying! Just be sure to make a fresh mask each time, as the mask only keeps for up to 12 hours in an airtight container.[17]",
            "Take a ripe banana and cut it into chunks. Bananas are packed with nutrients that diminish the look of wrinkles and help add a healthy glow to the skin.[18] In fact, bananas are so good at protecting the skin from free radicals and delaying the aging process that many people call them “Mother Nature’s Botox.”[19]",
            "Take the chunks and mash them with a fork or spoon. Be sure to get the banana as smooth as possible. Lumps will take longer to dry and will not be absorbed into the skin as well. If you want to use a food processor or a hand mixer you can, but it’s not necessary.",
            "Add half a teaspoon of organic honey to the mashed banana. Mix the honey and mashed bananas thoroughly. If you feel like the mixture is too thick, try adding a few drops of orange juice, milk, or cream. The citric acid in orange juice will also help to lighten dark pigmentation spots, and milk and cream will add extra moisture to the skin.[20]",
            "Apply the mask to your face and neck. You might want to put your hair up and wear an old shirt since applying the mask can get messy. Be sure to apply the mask using clean fingers, and massage the mask onto the skin with gentle, circular motions. You can also apply a second coat if you prefer.",
            "Let it soak into your face for 15 minutes. In order to let the nutrients in the mask sink into you skin for maximum effect, leave the mask on for at least 15 minutes. If you are looking for extra moisture, you can leave the mask on for up to 30 minutes.",
            "Rinse your face with lukewarm water. Using a clean washcloth or your clean hands, rinse away all of the banana mask. Make sure to get the entire mask off so it does not clog your pores. Apply moisturizer as soon as you are all rinsed off for best results!"

            "Prepare your mind to focus on her.[1] This massage is to relax her. Your goal is to make her time with you better through this intimate connection. Prepare to focus entirely on her for at least 30 minutes if not longer. Think about what she likes when she relaxes and use those insights to create the perfect environment for a backrub.",
            "Find a room or area with ample privacy. For the massage to work best her back will need to be completely exposed. This means she will probably be topless. You need to make sure the area you choose has plenty of privacy from neighbors and kids. If you have kids in the home, you may consider locking the door.\n\n\nThe bedroom can be a great place for a massage. However, be ready to stay on your knees most of the time. You will probably need lots of towels to ensure the oils do not get on the sheets, pillows, or comforter.\nAvoid giving a massage on the couch. Although convenient it provides little room to maneuver for applying pressure.",

You need a surface where she can lie comfortably without being cold. Somewhere with plenty of support. You will be pushing down on her back so avoid the waterbed.",
            "Queue up some relaxing music. If she has a favorite album or band that she likes to listen to when relaxing, go with that. Otherwise find something relaxing. Your local music store will likely have plenty to choose from if you feel stuck. Try to avoid the radio since you can't control what might come on or what commentators might say between songs or commercials.\n\n\nIn a pinch you may be able to find some relaxing playlists online or using a smartphone app. Some premium streaming music services provide highly customizable playlists with no commercials.",
            "Set the mood with some scented oils. Essential oils used in aromatherapy can provide just the right touch to a room. If you know that your room has unwanted odors or scents you definitely want something that smells good. Orange blossom oil, for example, has a fragrance that can produce a calming sensation.[3]\n\nSome essential oils can be incorporated into your massage oil. Lavender oil is particularly relaxing when used this way.",
            "Light the room with candles. Electric lighting is usually not intended to calm. Most electric lighting can be pretty harsh on the eyes. Natural lighting from candles will produce enough light to perform the massage but is not so bright as to upset the mood. The room should be calm and inviting. Candle light creates a very warm environment.\n\n\nIf you are using heated essential oils you will want to find non-scented candles to avoid mixing smells. You may chose to go with a scented candle in lieu of essential oils altogether.",
            "Have massage oil ready for use.[4] For muscles to get the most attention you must have some oil. Oil reduces friction on the skin. This allows you to press without dragging or pulling the skin with your fingers or hands. Have plenty of massage oil ready to use on both your hands and on her back.\n\n\nMassage oil bottles will get very messy if you need to add additional oil. Consider wrapping your massage oil bottle with a small washcloth and rubber band or putting your massage oil in a liquid pourer such as a small liquid measuring cup.",
            "Set aside plenty of cloth towels for various usages. Cloth towels, especially cotton towels, can be used for numerous tasks. You can use them to wipe off excess oil. They can also be used to cover body parts when needed. If your wife is lying face down, she may like a towel under her knees or rolled up to relax her feet on.\n\n\nIf your wife wants to completely undress for the massage, use a towel to cover her buttocks and upper thighs if she feels too exposed.",

You want to stretch the muscles in your hands and wrists before you begin the massage. Do this by putting your open hands together in front of you with fingers extended. With one hand, push the other with your fingertips. Repeat for both hands.\n\n\nAnother stretch is to squeeze a stress ball. This can strengthen your fingers for a harder massage.",
            "Take time to put the starting touches on the massage area. While she is decompressing go ahead and put the finishing touches on the setup. Light the candles and turn on the music. Wait until she is ready to do any of this. If you do this before she has arrived she may not feel she can de-stress. Furthermore you don't want to leave the candles unattended since they can catch other items on fire.",

If she is uncomfortable with taking off her bra for this you may allow her to lie down before unfastening the strap. Let her know that oil may get on her bra if she does not remove it after lying down.",
            "Apply oil to your hands and her back.[6] Unless you are used to spreading oil on skin, start by applying the oil to your hands. Then rub your hands on her back. If you seem to need more, put more on your hands and repeat. Do this until your hands slide effortlessly up and down her back. Be sure to get her shoulders, neck, and sides.",

Gently squeeze your hands to put pressure on the muscles in her shoulders. Apply pressure evenly with your fingers as you massage the muscles. Avoid the collar bone and move left and right from neck to arms and back.\n\n\nOne technique is to place your thumb on the back of her shoulder for pressure. While keeping the fingers in the same place, move the thumb across her back and toward her neck with each squeeze. Reposition your fingers and hand periodically to ensure a complete massage.\nDon't forget the neck and the upper arms. With the neck, simply massage the back and sides gently with your fingertips and thumbs. With the upper arms you will come almost entirely off the shoulder and knead the upper arm. Apply equal pressure with your fingers and thumb and allow your hand to slip away from the arm with each squeeze.",
            "Knead the sides of the back with your thumbs and fingers.[7] After massaging her shoulders, move to her back. Place your open hands on each side of her back. with the tips of your fingers and thumbs, begin making small circular movements while slightly opening and closing your hand. As you move down the back, massage with your thumbs the muscles beside the spine while your fingers massage her sides.\n\n\nAvoid the spine or anything that might tickle or cause pain.[8] The spine and muscles do not massage well. You can cause a lot of unwanted pain (or injury) by pressing too hard on them. Furthermore, any tickling, punching, poking, slapping, or scratching should be avoided unless requested. Typically this upsets a calm mood.\nIf you were not making circular movements, your fingers would be moving in and out from your palm about and inch or two.\nKeep your fingers spread apart during this exercise. This provides more coverage and pressure is distributed more evenly. Try to apply pressure evenly throughout the bottom of the finger rather than focused on the tips.",
            "Slide your hand up and down the sides of her back.[9] After kneading the back and sides you can use a hand slide. Slide your open hand, palm down, up her back from the lower back to her shoulders and arms. Then slide your hands back to her lower back. Repeat this motion several times remembering to provide even pressure throughout the hand. If you feel a lot of friction, add more oil promptly.",
            "Use your body's weight for pressure.[10] As the massage progresses you may notice your hands getting fatigued. Position yourself so that you can use your body weight to apply pressure. Not too much pressure--you don't want to hurt her. But use your body's weight instead of constant squeezing to give your hands a break. This technique is especially useful when sliding up and down her back."

    "wikiHow to Care for a Christmas Cactus": {
        "intro": "A beautiful holiday plant (botanically known as Schlumbergera or Zygocactus), the Christmas Cactus unsurprisingly blooms at Christmas and also sometimes around Easter time if cared for properly. A month prior to Christmas you will be able to watch the tips of the leaves beginning to grow. The tips grow darker as each day passes, until a bud forms. At Christmas time, as if by magic, the buds open to a beautiful flower that will add color and warmth to any holiday season.",
        "steps": [
            "Give your Christmas Cactus bright but indirect light. Keep the plant in a well-lit location (like near a window) away from direct sunlight – too much heat and light can stunt growth and burn the leaves. It should also be away from drafts, heat vents, fireplaces or other sources of hot air.[1]\n\nMove an indoors plant outdoors in summer to a shady location. It is best to keep in a normal house temperature range, about 65 to 75°F (18 to 20°C). That being said, cooler night temperatures can be used to initiate blooming. We'll discuss getting it to bloom in the final section.\nIf it's in a north or east-facing window, you won't have to worry about light. But if it's in a south or west-facing window, diffuse the light with semi-transparent curtains or some other light-diffusing device.",
            "Provide the plant a source of humidity if you live in a dry environment. Put a tray of water next to the plant so that the water evaporates and provides humidity. Alternatively, you can make a humidity tray by placing the pot on a waterproof saucer that is filled with gravel and halfway filled with water.\n\n\n50 to 60% humidity is the ultimate goal.[2] If your environment is close to that, you should be fine.",
            "Use a well-draining container and well-draining soil. For the container, some of the cheap nursery planters will work well, and orchid planters (the plastic basket kind) work well also. Pair this planter with a planter that will hold water and allow the basket to fit down into it. Then, place a few medium sized rocks into the bottom so that the basket container will be held about an inch above the bottom. [3]\n\nUse a combination of 3 parts potting soil to one part sand for the potting medium. An alternative is one part potting soil, two parts peat moss or compost, and one part sharp sand or perlite.[4] Whichever way you go, pour about two inches of room temperature water into the outer container and set the basket container inside. After about twelve hours, pour out any remaining water. Repeat this as often as the plant needs water; it will vary based on your home's condition. Monitor its need with a moisture prod and adjust accordingly.",
            "Add fertilizer to assist plant growth. Plants that are actively growing should be given a blooming houseplant-type fertilizer. This is best done for a plant that is 2-3 weeks old. Follow the label directions for how much and how often to feed.\n\n\nFertilizing is important to keep the plant in good condition; the joints are fragile and can break apart if the plant descends into poor health. Generally, it should be fertilized 2-4 times a year with a 20-20-20 feed, but stop feeding about a month before the buds appear (this usually means stopping by the end of October).",
            "Water a Christmas Cactus with care. Caring for this plant can be a bit tricky as you need to take care not to overwater or underwater it:\n\n\nA Christmas cactus is a tropical cactus, not a desert cactus. Unlike most desert cacti, this variety cannot tolerate completely dry soil. If the soil gets too dry, the flowers buds will drop, and the plant will wilt. Feel the soil with your fingers; if it feels dry, it's time to water.\nToo much watering will cause spots from white rot to appear on the leaves, and the leaves will likely fall off. The soil should be evenly moist for best growth. The rule of thumb is less water is better than too much water.\n\nWhen watering, thoroughly water the plant. Before attempting to water the plant again, check to see that the top inch of soil has dried thoroughly first. Mist leaves as well as watering the soil.",
            "Change your watering schedule seasonally. Water the cactus based on your environment and the time of year. A good method is to water a cactus as follows:[5]\n\n\nDry climate, outdoors: Water every two to three days when warm and sunny\n\nHumid, cool or indoors: Water every week\nDuring the fall and winter months, the plants should be watered less frequently in order to promote blooming.",
            "Stop watering around October. When October hits, your watering duties are over. You can carefully resume a light watering in November. If it's dry where you live, feel free to place the pot over a tray of moist pebbles. This is all to set up the bloom happening around Christmas.\n\n\nThe only other time you should cease watering is after the plant blooms. At this time, cease watering for about 6 weeks to allow the plant to rest. New growth will still appear – and that is when watering should be resumed.",
            "Watch out for bud drop. One of the most frustrating things that can happen to Christmas cactus is after the flower buds have developed they drop off the plant. Bud drop can be caused by several different conditions. Usually it's because of over-watering, but it can also be due to a lack of humidity or insufficient light.\n\n\nIf this starts happening, water the plant less and add some fertilizer to the pot. Move it to an area away from a hot radiator or vent and try a new spot where it can get a bit more sunlight.",
            "Encourage the flower blooming for the holiday season by lowering the temperature. The key to getting Christmas cactus to flower during the holiday season is proper light exposure, correct temperatures and limited watering. If you manipulate these things yourself, you can time a bloom just how you'd like.\n\n\nBecause this plant is thermo-photoperiodic, it will set buds when day length is about equal to night length and when the temperature drops to 50 to 60 degrees F for several weeks. If the temperature drops further, the plant will not bloom.\nFrom September and October, the Christmas Cactus should be kept in a cool room where temperatures will remain around 50-55°F (10-12°C), give or take a few degrees. Don't expose the plant to freezing temperatures. Plants should be blooming for the holidays if cool treatments are started by early November.",
            "Keep the plant in a dark room during the night. During the fall months, the Christmas Cactus should be placed in a spot where it receives indirect, bright light during the daylight hours but total darkness at night – it requires long, uninterrupted dark periods of about 12 hours or more.[6]\n\nBegin the dark treatments in about mid-October to have plants in full bloom by the holidays. Place the plants in a dark area from about 12 or more hours each night for 6-8 weeks or until you see buds forming. A closet or unused bathroom are ideal places.\nBe especially careful with watering at this time. Reduce the watering slightly. Do not soak the soil after a dry period; only moisten the top few inches, since buds, flowers and even leaves can fall off if the roots are suddenly saturated.",
            "When you see flower buds forming, increase light and humidity. The \"dark ages\" are over when your plant starts budding. At this point, you should increase, humidity, light, water (not too much, of course), and the temperature. In other words, continue as you were a few months ago.\n\n\nIf the buds form too early, you can lower the temperature to stunt them. When you're ready, up the temperature and they should resume their progress.[7]",
            "Prune the Christmas cactus about a month after blooming. This will encourage the plant to branch out, especially after a period of \"rest\" has been granted. It will not look very pretty after the blossoms have faded. Some people wait until March or so, when new growth begins, to prune the cactus.\n\n\nAs mentioned before, cease watering for 30 days post-bloom. When you see new growth forming, you can begin watering again.",
            "Propagate a Christmas Cactus by cutting off short, Y-shaped sections of the stem. Each section must consist of two or three joined segments. Allow each section to dry for a few hours before pushing them into a 3-inch pot that contains the same potting soil as the parent plant. Plant halfway down the first segment and water sparingly to prevent rot from developing.[8]\n\nTreat the cuttings as mature plants. In about four to six weeks, the cuttings should have rooted and will begin to show some new growth. They grow quickly, and should take in about two or three weeks. You can fertilize after the cutting has grown one new segment.",
            "Repot every 2-3 years. Your plant should be fine for a couple of years unless the root system gets diseased or harmed. Apart from this, a new pot is needed when the roots have filled it or when the soil has been officially depleted of nutrients. Most people do this in the spring.\n\n\nWhen replanting or repotting, use new, fresh soil. It's worth the few extra dollars since it will probably be sitting in that soil for a long time. Your plant is a living thing like you, so it deserves the best.\nThe best time for repotting is between February and April, about once every three years.[9] Just be sure not to give it a pot that's too big; the Christmas Cactus flowers best when it's pot-bound."

By some estimates, if you weigh 130 lb (59 kg), you can burn anywhere from 325 to 550 calories per hour, depending on your speed.[2] This makes cycling a great way to lose weight. There are several ways to use a bike to get skinnier legs:\n\n\nBiking around casually. Bike to the grocery store instead of driving. Bike to work instead of taking public transportation. If you bike casually, going about 11 mph (17.6 km/h), you can burn 275-450 calories per hour, depending on your weight.[2]\n\nUse a stationary bike at home or at the gym. Because this is a lighter exercise, expect to burn anywhere from 250-450 calories per hour, depending on your weight.[2]\n\nDo a spinning class. Spinning classes are butt-kicking but definitely worth it. The advantage here is that you burn a lot of calories: a 145 lb (65.8 kg) person might expect to burn about 750-1000 calories per hour of very vigorous spinning. On the other hand, spinning can be quite monotonous and you'll have to push yourself for maximum results.",

With your left leg, raise it to your hip level. Pretend your leg is in a barrel and with your toes, lead the rest of your leg to trace the inside of the barrel. Your leg will go up, down, and around in circles. Do 50-100 circles, switch legs, and do the same number on the other side.",

Make sure that your knees are aligned with your feet. Never let your knees go past your toes.\nExhale deeply and use your legs and hips, not your back, to lift out of the squat. Do three sets of 20 repetitions each.\n\n\nDo split squats with a dumbbell or other weight:\n\nUsing both hands, hold out a weight.\nStanding in front of a bench, lift your right leg back so that it is resting comfortably on the bench. Your supported leg should form a 90° angle.\nBend into a squat by lowering the left leg, so that the right knee almost hits the floor.\nExplode upward. Do this 8 times, 3-4 sets each. Repeat using opposite leg.\n\n\nDo jump squats\n\nGo all the way down into a standard squat.\nInstead of returning to starting position, jump into the air as high as possible, landing with both feet on the ground.\nRepeat carefully, 15 times, 3-4 sets each. These squats can be more strenuous on the knees.",
            "Target your legs with other exercises. There's a host of great exercises that you can do to help burn fat and build muscle. These exercises should be done two or three times a week for the best results. Here are just a few of them:\n\n\n\nLunges. With a 5 or 8-lb (2 or 4 kg) dumbbell in each hand, lunge forward with one leg and bring the opposite knee about an inch above the ground. Step back and continue with the opposite leg. Do eight to twelve repetitions on each leg.\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Image titled Get Skinny Legs Quick Step 14Bullet1\" src=\"http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/44/Get-Skinny-Legs-Quick-Step-14Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/aid108621-v4-728px-Get-Skinny-Legs-Quick-Step-14Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"546\" class=\"whcdn content-fill\">\n\nInner-thigh press.

Kneel on a mat with your elbows bent down on the floor. Lift your leg up and extend it fully behind your body. Bend your lifted leg and draw it in so that it lightly taps the back of your right knee. Extend the left leg out again. Repeat with other leg 10 to 20 times.",
            "Swim for a great full-body workout. Do some laps using the freestyle motion. Learn how to do a flip turn so that you won't have to stop when you get to the end of the lap. Swimming is an excellent way to burn calories and build up leg muscle, as well as a great cardiovascular exercise. Burn about 440-480 calories doing a moderate freestyle workout for an hour.[3]\n\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks. Different strokes burn different amounts of calories. For most people, butterfly stroke burns the most calories, while backstroke burns the least.[3]\n\nKeep in mind that the number of calories you burn in an hour will depend on your age, muscle tone, fitness level, weight, intensity of the workout, and other factors.",
            "Use the elliptical. The elliptical is that funny looking, stationary machine that you can run or jog on; it has arm supports that move when you walk/jog. A 140 lb (64 kg) individual doing a moderate intensity workout on the elliptical trainer can expect to burn roughly 300 to 600 calories in an hour.\n\n\nIf your goal is to slim down by losing fat in your legs instead of building muscle, then aim to keep your heart rate high while you're on the elliptical. You can also try interval training.",
            "Take a dance or Zumba class. Zumba is dance fitness program created by a Colombian dancer and choreographer. The average 140 lb (64 kg) individual can expect to burn about 450 calories after an hour-long Zumba workout.[4] A dancer can expect to probably burn a little less than that, depending on the workout intensity — about 275.",
            "Join an organized/intramural sport. The gym is a good opportunity to band together with other like-minded, similarly-motivated people who are looking to have fun and burn weight. In order of most calories burned, the following sports are good for exercise:\n\n\nPlaying full-court basketball can burn up to 700 calories in an hour for a 140 lb/64 kg person, provided that they are moving the entire game.\nPlaying competitive soccer may be able to burn up to 650 calories in an hour if you are running and actively participating for the entire game.\n\nRollerskating can burn roughly 525 calories an hour while ice-hockey can burn around 450.[3]",

To lose one pound of weight, you must burn 3,500 more calories than you take in as food. To make sure you that you are doing this, keep track of the calories that you eat as well as how much you exercise. You can use a diary or an online fitness tracker.\n\n\nIt is safe and realistic to lose one pound a week. Break this up into daily goals. For example, you might decide to cut 500 calories a day or set daily cardio goals to burn more calories.",
            "Eat more protein instead of carbohydrates. Protein is vital for building and maintaining muscle mass. Sources of lean protein include fish, chicken, tofu, and turkey.\n\n\nStay away from simple carbohydrates found in processed or refined products.[7] These include:\n\nCandy\nSugary, carbonated beverages, such as colas\nSyrups\nSugars\n\n\nComplex carbohydrates are acceptable to eat, although they should at most make up 60% of your total caloric intake.[7] Complex carbs include:\n\nLegumes\nStarchy vegetables\nWhole-grain breads and cereals",

            "Drink water instead of sugary drinks. Many doctors recommend that males get 10-12 cups of water per day, which works out to 2.5–2.9 liters (0.7–0.8 US gal), while females are recommended to drink 8-10 cups per day, about 2.0–2.4 liters (0.5–0.6 US gal).[8] Water will help your immune system stay healthy, keep your skin looking great, and give you more lasting energy to do the things you need to do during the day.\n\n\nYou probably already know this, but sodas, juices, and other sugary drinks aren't the way to go if you want to shed pounds off of your legs. Sugars, as mentioned above, are simple carbohydrates, an excess of which will lead to more calories. Reach for a glass of water instead! You'll see the difference.\n(Unsweetened) green tea is another good substitute for sugary drinks. Green tea contains a good amount of antioxidants, meaning that it helps your body fight against free radicals, which enhance signs of aging in humans.[9]\nIf you are trying to eat less, drink of cup of green tea before a meal. You'll notice that you feel more full and won't need to eat as much.",
            "Get the right kinds of fats into your diet. Common sense tells us that if we want to lose flab, we better cut out fats. Right? Not always. Getting the right kinds of fats into your diet gives us energy and helps us absorb vitamins, while getting the wrong kinds of fats will make it harder for us to shed those extra pounds.\n\n\nEat healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 is needed to regulate clotting, build up cell membranes and support cell health. Food high in omega-3 fatty acids include:[10]\nFish, notably salmon\nNuts and seeds, notably flaxseed\nLeafy greens, notably kale and spinach\n\n\nAvoid saturated fats such as butter, solid shortening, lard and fatback.[11]\n\nAvoid trans fats, which are found in vegetable shortenings, margarine, cookies, snack foods and other foods containing or fried in partially hydrogenated oils.[11]",
            "Eat small portions. Make the most of your day by eating often, but little. Try eating five meals a day, with a couple meals being small snacks (sauteed vegetables or nuts make a great snack) in between.\n\n\nTry eating more in the morning than at night. Ever heard the phrase \"Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper?\" That's because your metabolism starts slowing down during the nighttime as it prepares for bedtime, making late meals prime candidates for being stored as fat instead of burned as calories.[12]\n\nDrinking water before meals can result in consuming less calories at those meals, which can ultimately lead to weight loss. Water makes you feel fuller, so you do not need to eat as much food to reach the point of satiety.",
            "Don't expect to lose the weight from just your legs. The body converts fat into energy when it's exercising or low on food. Unfortunately, the body converts fat from wherever it wants, and not always where you want it to. It highly depends on your body type. Some people are bottom heavy, whereas other people can be top heavy.\n\n\nSpot-training, or working one area of your body at a time, may help tone your legs but it will not slim them down. You will need to reduce your overall body weight.",
            "Don't starve yourself. A lot of people who want to lose weight make this mistake. Their reasoning is that calories get stored as fat when the body doesn't use them; calories come from food; if they starve themselves, they'll get fewer calories; if they get fewer calories, there will be less fat to store. This is a misconception.\n\n\nWhat happens when a person starves him/herself? The body realizes it is getting less food, your metabolism slows down to save energy, and you start consuming lean tissue instead of fat reserves because the body wants to prepare itself for a while without food.\nIf you do manage to lose weight by starving yourself (you did it the hard, painful way!) your body will gain all the fat back as soon as you begin eating again, and you should eat again. Why is this? Because your metabolism is still hibernating, and it needs to be kick started. How do you kickstart it? By eating the right types of foods in the first place.",
            "Do not give up. It can take three or four months before you start noticing results. Many people with really good intentions and strong discipline quit just before they start to see results. They work like crazy for a month, don't see any results, and throw their hands up in the air in despair. Keep at it!",
            "Use your legs less if you are skinny but your legs are muscled. Most people who want skinny legs would like to be a bit skinnier all over. But some people who want skinny legs are perfectly skinny in their abs and arms — just not in their legs.\n\n\nExercise your full body, not just your legs. If your legs are abnormally muscled, that's a sign that you're working them a little too hard at the expense of the other muscles in your body.\nGenetics can affect the size of your legs. Some people might store more fat in their legs than others. You can still be fit and have great legs even if they are not as slender as you might want them to be. Accept who you are and embrace it."

    "wikiHow to Keep a Bored Indoor Cat Entertained While You're Not at Home": {
        "intro": "While you're out, your cat will feel alone and will need something to keep him entertained. A bored cat is a destructive cat. Creating a stimulating environment or providing interactive toys can give a cat plenty to keep it entertained while you're away. Remember, your cat needs to act on its natural instincts, and providing your cat the means to do that will make it happier when it's alone.",
        "steps": [
            "Make your own toy. You can make it simple by simply wadding up some paper for the cat to bat around. There are many ideas for making basic cat toys. However, you can also get some tools and build a toy that involves all the bells and whistles of a store-bought toy.[1]",
            "Choose a toy that involves movement. Some toys allow a cat to bat around balls in tubes or on towers. There are even some toys that play the laser game with the cat. Cats love to follow movement, and these kinds of toys will help keep them from getting bored.[2] There also toys that mimic the movements of cat's natural play that will help keep the cat entertained.[3]",
            "Avoid toys that have pieces a cat could swallow while you’re gone. You don’t want to come home to a vet emergency because your cat has swallowed something that will make it sick. Providing safe toys will help dissuade cats from going for more dangerous items, but the best bet is to secure unsafe items away from the cat’s reach. Your best bet is to check any warnings on the packaging to see if they recommend against unsupervised play.[4]",
            "Find a toy that a cat can hit with their paws. In addition to allowing for movement, this allows the cat to control the motion, unlike with a laser toy or a toy that constricts the movement to a specific space. The cat can bat toy mice or little balls across the room and then chase them. It also helps if some of the toys are ones that cat can carry. This will help the cat live out its natural prey drive, and keep it entertained when it's home alone.[5]",
            "Choose an interactive toy with treats. Some toys are designed to challenge a cat before dispensing a treat. This will give the cat something to work out while you're gone, and give it a nice treat, too. This helps the cat work its mind and body.[6]",
            "Buy or build spaces for the cat to climb. An enriching environment will invite the cat to do more while you're gone. Just make sure that the cat can easily get down from any of these spaces. There are all kinds of cat trees and cat climbing spaces available out there. [7] If you’re worried about design, there are also design-friendly cat climbing fixtures.[8]\n\nYou can buy a lot of different structures from your local pet store or online.\nYou can build a cat castle by taping or stapling cardboard boxes together and cutting out holes for the cat to climb through. Cats love boxes.\nYou can even put up cat shelves for the cats to explore.[9]",
            "Arrange the structures so that the cat can easily jump or climb from space to space. You don’t want your cat to break something trying to get to a high spot, so make it easy for them to climb to it. You also don’t want the cat to injure themselves or damage furniture in trying to make the jump or climb, so it’s best to make sure high places aren’t too far apart. Test out the distances with your cat when you’re home.[10]",
            "Remove any dangerous or breakable items from the area. If you have breakable items that you value, you may want to have a closed-in curio to display them, so that your cat won’t knock them over. Also remove dangerous houseplants, cotton balls, and anything else the cat might be interested in chewing up and swallowing.[11]",
            "Leave cat toys around the house. Cats like to discover their toys and it can be a great way to keep them entertained. The more toys the better. You can leave them in high places and even some hidden places (under the couch, for instance). That way the cat has \"prey\" all around the house.[12]",
            "Leave the blinds open so that the cat can look outside while you're gone. Cats like motion, so they will enjoy seeing birds and squirrels go by. It will help keep them entertained in a non-predictable way, and is very cost effective as well. You need not open all the blinds or curtains, just a few that are near the couch or the cat's favorite perch.[13]",
            "Get a scratching post or three. This is a great way to keep a cat busy. Cats need to scratch, and scratching posts are essential if you don’t want your furniture and carpet completely scratched up. Scratching posts may not completely resolve that problem, but it will mostly likely help. There are all kinds of scratching posts out there in many different designs and to fit many different budgets.[14]\n\nTry out different designs to see which the cat likes best. This will help keep your cat away from the furniture.[15]",
            "Keep the television on. The volume shouldn't be turned up too high, but at normal speaking level. Human voices will make your cat less lonely, and the TV can be set for colorful children's programs or nature programs featuring birds and fish. This will help keep a cat entertained with the movement on the screen.[16]",
            "Put on some music or sounds that your cat likes. Classical is often a nice genre, but if you know your cat likes a particular kind of music, play that. Leave it on repeat so that the cat has music all day long. The music should help relax an anxious cat.[17]",
            "Leave out a couple of small, light boxes for your cat to jump around in. Cats love strange hiding places. Boxes are a cost effective way to keep your cat entertained. They are also easy to modify for cat toy projects.[18]",
            "Choose a space for the catio. You’ll want a space where the cat can at least see outside. If you have a sunroom or a closed-in porch, that can function as the perfect catio. The cat will be able to see birds and squirrels, which will keep them entertained for hours. A window can be a great fit for a catio.[19]",
            "Get any necessary permits or permissions. If you rent, you may not be able to add a catio without the permission of your landlord. If it is an easily removable catio, this might not be a problem, but if you are building onto the house, it will likely need permission. Permits may also be required by the city or home owners’ association. Contact your local permit office to get more information.[20]",
            "Order or build a catio. If you don’t have a sunroom or closed-in porch, you may have to build or buy a catio. Many places have design plans you can buy, as well as pre-designed catios that you simple have to install. If you’re making your own, you’ll need a screen that a cat can’t claw through, wood for structural support, and a hard piece of material for the base. You can always make the base cushy, once you have the basic support.[21][22]\n\nMake sure you measure your window before ordering a pre-made catio.",
            "Install the catio. When you have your catio, install it in the window. If you’ve measured correctly, this should be as easy as installing a window air conditioning unit. You’ll want to make sure that there is no space around the catio for the cat to escape. If the catio doesn’t fit perfectly, place some kind of firm barrier that the cat can’t move in the space.[23]",
            "Check to make sure the catio is secure. Make sure there are no cat-sized spaces for the cat to escape. Also make sure the catio has enough structural support. You might want to place something that weighs the same as your cat or cats in the catio to see if it remains stable. Shake the catio to make sure it's firmly in place. The last thing you will want is to come home and find your cat has escaped.[24]\n\nDon’t forget to make sure that other animals, especially predators, can’t get into or dislodge the catio.[25]",
            "Let your cat go for a test run. This is important for a couple of reasons. Letting the cat go for a test run while you’re home will allow you to see if there are any problems that could arise while you’re gone. It will also let you see if your cat even likes the catio and how your cat interacts with it.[26]"

To prevent this, go through all your things, including clothes, toys, accessories, and other items and decide what you want to keep and what you want to sell, donate, or throw away.[14]\n\nTo help you decide what to keep and what to get rid of, ask yourself what items you haven't used or worn in over a year. If you haven't used something in over a year, there's a good chance you can get rid of it without missing it.\nGood items to sell or donate include clothes, toys, shoes, and books. Only throw things out if they're broken, have holes, or can't be reused or recycled.",

It is a controversial disorder, so people with DID may suffer extreme stigma.[1] Treat a person with DID with compassion to promote wellness.",
        "steps": [
            "Know the symptoms. DID is characterized by the presence of alternate identities, often referred to as alters. These identities are often complex, with their own unique histories and physical and behavioral traits. For example, an adult may have a child alter. You may notice changes in voice and physical movement, in addition to changes of attitude and preferences. As different alters present, the person may report loss of memory or a sense of lost time, as he or she may not be aware when an alter is present. Moving between alters is referred to as \"switching\"[2]\n\nPeople with DID may also experience anxiety, depression, self-harm, sleep disturbances, and/or drug and alcohol abuse.\nSeverity of symptoms varies greatly among individuals.",
            "Suspend your judgement. People experiencing mental disorders often do not seek or comply with treatment because of stigma associated with being mentally ill.[3] This may be particularly true for people with DID, as it isn't universally accepted as a disorder, despite its inclusion in the DSM-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders describing diagnostic criteria for all mental disorders. Avoid contributing to the shame and embarrassment a person with DID may already feel.\n\n\nAcknowledge how difficult it must be to manage the reactions of others. This will show you understand the complexity of living with a mental disorder.",

Is the individual is a friend or family member, ask about his or her experiences to show you care.[4] Strangers may feel very uncomfortable with questions about their mental health, so do not pry.\n\n\nAsk how he or she feels before and after \"switching\" to get a better understanding of his or her experience.\nExpress empathy by recognizing how frightening, confusing, and frustrating these experiences must be.",
            "Just be there. Shame and stigma often lead people with mental disorders to feel very isolated. Help the person maintain a healthy relationship by actively engaging with him or her. You don't need to discuss DID. In fact, it may be better to spend time together not discussing the disorder.

To begin, gather the right container, soil, and root hormones for your plant. Next, you will cut, replant, and cover the plant. Ensure that growing conditions are favorable for your particular plant to help it flourish.",
        "steps": [
            "Choose your cloning container. The type of container you choose will depend upon how large the plant will be once it grows and how many plants you’re trying to clone in one container. Do a little research on your plant first to determine how big your container should be.\n\n\nSome people prefer to use pots for plant cloning, while others will use something as simple as a plastic cup with holes poked into the bottom.\nA translucent container is usually best so you can see when and where the plant is taking root.",
            "Decide whether you want to clone the plant in rockwool or soil. When you clone plants, you put a piece of a plant into soil or rockwool so that it can take root and grow.\n\n\nRockwool is more complicated and requires more preparation than soil. It’s needs to be soaked overnight in water with a PH balance of 4.5, and it doesn’t contain the same nutrients that natural soil does.[1] You also need to take the time to cut a hole in the center of a rockwool block so that it’s not too big and not too small for the plant you’re cloning.\nPotting soil, seed starting mix, or well composted garden soil can all be used for your plant. Normal soil dug up from your garden may not be ideal.",
            "Decide whether or not you want to use a root hormone. Root hormones are used in the cloning process to encourage plant cell growth. Plants naturally contain hormones called auxins, which help plants determine whether or not they should develop more leaves versus more roots. When you purchase a root hormone in a bottle, you’ll be using a synthetic auxin. When the auxin is applied, the plant will think it needs to grow more roots, and the cloning process begins. [2]\n\nIf you’re an organic gardener, root hormones may not be your friend. Many root hormones contain fungicides and chemicals that might not be earth friendly. If you are concerned about the use of chemicals in your gardening, you may want to opt for natural alternatives, such as willow tea, cinnamon, or diluted apple cider vinegar.[3]\n\nPlants like tomatoes are easily cloned because they produce a lot of natural auxin, but other plants may only put out roots from the original root ball at the tip of the stem — which may make it difficult to get the plant to root without a synthetic hormone.[4] Do some research on your plant before making any decisions to see what’s right for the situation.\nNever dip your plant matter into your container of hormone. Take out the amount of hormone you need and apply to the plant per the instructions included. This is too avoid contaminating your supply.",
            "Fill the pot or container with soil or rockwool.\n\n\nIf you’ve chosen to use soil, fill the container to the top. Poke a hole through the center, all the way down to the bottom of the container.\nIf you’ve chosen to use rockwool, you can simply insert the chunk of rockwool into the container.",
            "Water the soil. Pour enough water into the soil that it’s wet, but not drenched. If you’re using rockwool, it would already have been soaked overnight, so adding more water is not necessary.",
            "Make a diagonal cut on the stem of the plant using a sharp knife or scissors. You’ll want to select a lateral stem to cut, not a terminal stem. Terminal stems are the main stems that come up from the ground, while lateral stems protrude from the sides of the terminal stems. [5]\n\nAfter you’ve made your cut, look at the stem and remove any leaves or flower buds from its base. When there are too many leaves or buds on a plant cutting, they suck most of the water from the base of the stem and may keep your plant from rooting. [6]",
            "Dip the stem in root hormone (if you've that decided root hormones are right for your plant). Root hormones can be in liquid or powder form. If you’re using a powder, dip the stem in some water and then apply the powder to the end, so it sticks. Do not coat the whole stem in root hormone. Focus on lightly coating the very bottom of the stem.",

When you cover the plant, it keeps the moisture and allows the plant to continue living while it attempts to produce roots. [8] What you use to cover the plant will depend upon the container you’ve chosen to house your clone.",

This iconic dance that accompanies the opening of “Billie Jean” is quite complicated, but it is very impressive once you master it. It is incredible how much movement can be packed into a few bars of music. Michael Jackson performed a number of versions of this dance throughout his career.[1]The original dance from the eighties is the most famous. [2] Practice dancing slowly as well as practicing it to speed of the song. The trick to the dance is quick surprise movements, so always be ready to move quickly, and don’t forget your fedora!",

    "wikiHow to Get Rid of a Savior Complex": {
        "intro": "Are you cursed with an incessant need to save or fix those around you? A savior complex, or white knight syndrome, is a personality construct that, at first glance, appears to be purely motivated by the urge to help. In truth, a savior complex is unhealthy and can often give a person an outlet to focus on so that they don’t address their own problems. If you suffer from a savior complex, you can be cured. Get rid of your need to rescue others by changing how you relate to others, focusing on your own needs, and looking for the root of your compulsive helping.",
        "steps": [
            "Become an active listener. Notice that oftentimes others may just want to vent, not be fixed. A big problem for many “rescuers” is assuming others are helpless and unable to resolve their own problems. If you take up the practice of listening more actively, you may learn that your help is not needed—just a supportive shoulder and listening ear.\n\n\nWhen a partner or friend comes to you with a problem, aim to understand rather than immediately reply. Make occasional eye contact with the person. Face them. Examine their body language to cue into their emotional state (e.g. tensed shoulders may express fear or hesitation).\nOffer nonverbal cues like nodding to show you’re listening. Try to separate what you’re hearing from your own judgments in order to connect to the speaker’s message. If you’re not sure of what they’re trying to convey ask clarifying questions like “Are you saying…?”[1]",
            "Wait before stepping in. In addition to actually listening to what your loved one is saying, defy your savior nature and wait it out. You may find that people can often help themselves if given the chance. In fact, you may have been unwittingly building learned helplessness or enabling your loved ones by always swooping in to save the day.[2]\n\nChallenge yourself to not offer help or advice when a loved one comes to you with a problem. Repeat a mantra in your head like “I can be present for a friend without rescuing or fixing.”\nIf a friend is going through a difficult time, try giving them validating statements instead of offering to help. For example, you can say, \"I'm so sorry you're going through this right now.\" This shows your empathy without involving you in the problem.",
            "Offer help only when requested. One key aspect of the savior complex is the ingrained desire to help even when it’s not wanted or requested. Automatically assuming everyone wants to be rescued can actually be insulting since it demonstrates that you don’t believe in their ability to help themselves.[3] Prevent yourself from this by only taking action after a clear appeal for help.\n\n\nFor example, if a friend tells you about a bad day, simply listen without offering your own resolution. Only if the friend asks, “What do you think?” or “What should I do?” should you step into the helping role.\nIf a friend does ask for your help, only provide as much help as you are willing to give. Establish boundaries so that you do not over-commit yourself. For example, you can say, \"I don't think that I can talk to your friend for you. What I can do is help you take your mind off of your fight.\"",
            "Stop taking responsibility for other adults. Despite the close relationship you might have with partners, relatives, or friends, you need to realize that these individuals are separate entities in charge of their own lives. When you play the role of savior, you place everyone else into roles similar to helpless children or invalids.\n\n\nIt’s hard to see a loved one hurting or making a mistake, but it’s not your job to rescue them or correct every negative situation they encounter.[4]\n\nIn fact, adversity is oftentimes a cornerstone to positive growth and development. They need to go through difficulty in order to learn and improve. If you take that from them, you rob them of learning opportunities.\nTo help others establish their independence, try asking them questions about how they might handle the situation. You might ask things like \"What do you think you can do about this?\" or \"What options have you entertained?\"",
            "Accept your own inadequacy. Many people with the savior complex come off as goody two-shoes, lecturing others about their wrongdoings and many negative habits. While this may not be your intention, your loved ones may view your constant “fixing” habit as an indicator that you think they are broken or screwed up.\n\n\nEveryone has flaws. A person not recognizing that he or she has flaws is a flaw!\nRealize that \"success\" is defined subjectively. What is right for one may be wrong for another. You may have a particular way of judging what is best for a person, but that does not necessarily mean the other person sees it just in that way.\nCheck assumptions on knowing what is right for another. This is particularly true of peer relationships. There are some things like abusive situations, drug abuse, suicidal signs and the like that are fairly clear on being bad and needs immediate intervention.\nAccept your own strengths and weaknesses. You may or may not be the person to do a task or offer advice. No one person can do everything well.",
            "Be single. The savior and white knight often jumps from relationship to relationship, “rescuing” the helpless or damaged. If this describes you, it may be time to take a hiatus from relationships. If you are not in a long-term or committed relationship, take some time to enjoy being single and nurturing your own needs.[5]\n\nSpending some time single can help you gain more awareness into your compulsive helping/rescuing tendencies. It can also give you time to explore the parts of yourself that trigger this habit.\nYou may want to set an amount of time that you remain single to help you keep this goal. For example, you might want to give yourself six months. During this time, set goals for your self-improvement.",
            "Set objective goals for yourself. Compulsive helpers often allow their efforts to fix others to prevent them from doing any personal development of their own. What’s more, by viewing yourself as a savior you develop unrealistic goals that eventually wear away at your self-esteem. By creating realistic goals, you can rebuild. [6]\n\nSelect a goal for yourself that allows you to focus only on you. This might include anything from losing weight to writing a novel. Make it a SMART goal, which is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.\nYou might say, “I want to lose 15 pounds in 10 weeks.” Then, map out how you will achieve this goal: “I will eat a serving of vegetables at every meal. I will exercise 5 days per week. I will drink only water.”\nRun through your goals with another person. They may be able to tell if you if the goals are realistic or not. They may also be able to give you ideas to achieve your goals.",
            "Create a self-care toolbox. Individuals with a savior complex frequently dedicate all their time and energy to others, placing them in dire need of self-care. Balance your excessive helping of others by doing something nice for yourself. Create a routine that includes various nurturing activities.\n\n\nYou might create a soothing nighttime ritual to help you sleep better. Adopt a new exercise habit such as running or yoga. Get your hair or nails done weekly. Or, simply run a warm bath and listen to relaxing music. Pour back into yourself.\nAsk a friend or family member to be an accountability partner. This is a person who will check in and make sure you're following through with your self-care. Ask them to check in with you often.",
            "Examine past relationship patterns. Are you even aware of your innate need to fix or control others? Some people reading this may be in denial of a savior complex. By taking a closer look into your relationships with others, you can see a pattern of compulsive helping.\n\n\nHave you stayed in a relationship in which you were unhappy because you thought the other person needed you?\nDo you find yourself frequently worrying about others and their problems?\nDo you feel guilty when others help or give to you?\nAre you uncomfortable letting others experience negative emotions, so you quickly try to resolve the problem?\nDo you exit unhealthy relationships only to find yourself connecting with similar people as your past partners?[7]\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you may want to visit a therapist. A therapist can help you determine if these are unhealthy behaviors for you.",
            "Spot aspects of yourself that you have neglected. You may not realize that in your attempt to fix everyone around you, you have left yourself starving emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually. Perform a self-assessment to look closer at areas of personal need. You may find that you have been projecting your own shortcomings onto those around you.[8]\n\n\nIdentify your personal values. What beliefs, ideas, and principles drive your decisions and goals? Have you been living according to your values?\nExamine your emotional intelligence. Are you able to recognize your emotions and effectively express them?\nTake a look at your self-worth. Is your self-esteem connected to how much others value or need you?",
            "Acknowledge and make peace with childhood trauma or neglect. The compulsive need to rescue or help others is often rooted in your childhood. Researchers believe those who suffer from a savior complex or white knight syndrome are trying to fix some negative sense of themselves that arose in early life. Low self-esteem, abuse, or neglect may have contributed to this complex. You may choose friends or partners who are going through distress similar to that which you experienced in childhood.[9]\n\nAwareness is the first step in being able to repair a damaged sense of self. Take notice of the relational patterns you form and offer yourself compassion. You might even say aloud, “I am drawn to damaged or toxic people because I am trying to rescue the part of myself that was abused as a child.”\nIn addition to acknowledging this connection, it may help to see a professional counselor who can work with you to heal from past wounds.",
            "See a therapist for codependency issues. Deep down, people with savior complex or white knight syndrome have a problem with codependency. Codependency describes your reliance on others to feel emotional voids. In a sense, you neglect yourself in favor of doing for others because your self-worth comes from the desire to be needed.[10]\n\nYou can recover from codependency by working with a competent mental health therapist who has experience in this area.\nIt may also help to participate in self-help support groups for people with codependency issues.\nResearching codependency may help you identify your own patterns and needs. It can help you find a solution that works for you."

            "Clean it right away. Cast iron is easiest to clean right after cooking, before the food has a chance to become one with the skillet. As soon as it is cool enough to touch, wipe out the food remnants with a towel and rinse it with hot water.\n\n\nIf there's a layer of caked-on food at the bottom of the pan, use a mixture of kosher salt and vinegar to scrub it off with a paper towel. Afterward, rinse the skillet with hot water to make sure you wash off all traces of the vinegar.\nCaked-on food can also be burned off. Place your skillet in an oven turned to very high heat.

If you use this method you'll have to re-season the skillet, since the seasoning will get burned off, too.\nDon't use soap or a wire scrub brush on seasoned cast iron. It will scrape off the seasoning, removing the nonstick surface allowing moisture to react with the metal and create rust.",
            "Make sure the skillet gets completely dry. After you rinse out the food, dry the skillet completely. Use a dry dishcloth to wipe it off, taking care not to miss any crevices and make sure the back gets dried off, too.\n\n\nYou can place the pan upside down over the burner that you used to cook on, if the burner is still a little warm. This will help the pan dry faster.\nTo make extra sure the pan is dry, heat it up in the oven for a few minutes.",

However, you can help the process along and make sure your skillet stays completely nonstick by using the full seasoning process from time to time, especially if you had to use vinegar and salt to clean it.",
            "Store the skillet in a dry place. Make sure water from other kitchen supplies doesn't drip onto the pan. If you're storing it with other cookware, line it with a dry dishcloth or paper towel to protect the surface of the cast iron."
